April 10, 2025 13:02 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=141981&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and more Magnificent 7 stocks slide

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+2.93%), Apple (AAPL+4.60%), Amazon (AMZN+1.51%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-0.97%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+1.61%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.62%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+5.51%), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC-3.28%), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR-1.32%), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA+2.34%). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

(Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why choose to invest in Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) at 25 times earnings when Google stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) is available at a lower multiple of 20? You might still want to, especially when you consider these key points: Some might consider Meta a “safe haven,” but its past market behavior suggests otherwise. For example, META stock dropped more than 75% during the 2022 inflation shock, and fell by around 35% during the uncertainty of 2020. So, it’s not exactly a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how key stocks have performed during and after the last six market crashes. META’s stock price experienced a significant pullback, declining from nearly $740 in February to approximately $505 earlier this week. Subsequently, following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, the stock rallied to its current price of $585. For investors looking for a potentially more resilient and better-performing option, consider the Trefis High Quality portfolio. This strategy has delivered more than 75% returns since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. If you’re confident in the long-term potential of AI, Meta Platforms offers a compelling opportunity. Unlike companies that only build AI, Meta also implements it across billions of users. This gives Meta a unique edge in monetizing AI advances through advertising, content suggestions, and improved user experiences. With substantial investments in AI R&D and the largest social media user base globally, Meta is well-positioned to benefit from AI growth—no matter which specific technologies win out. Despite its advantages, investing in Meta involves risk. One concern is that Meta’s earnings could fall short, or its growth could decline from 20% to around 15% soon. This slowdown may stem from the broader economy, where businesses are likely to cut ad spending to conserve cash. Additionally, unknown or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock. As a result, investors should be ready for possible steep declines—up to 40%. Selling during such downturns could hurt long-term returns. Still, for those with a 3-5 year time horizon who can handle volatility, Meta’s current price levels might present a good entry point into AI. If you're interested in strategies to weather downturns and even benefit from them, you might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices), or speak with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets. Staying calm and strategic during market swings is often key to building substantial wealth. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Title: These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Silicon Valley leaders donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign or inaugural fund. They visited him at Mar-a-Lago and sat front-and-center as he was sworn into office. But in the first three months of his presidency, their wallets have taken a hit from his policies. The companies founded or run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have cumulatively lost nearly $1.8 trillion in value since the start of this year, even after markets rebounded Wednesday in response to Trump’s pause on many planned tariffs. As a result, the personal wealth of those leaders has shrunk, too. Tech’s top brass almost certainly hoped to gain some business benefits by hitching their wagons to Trump’s — such as fewer regulations or reduced antitrust pressure. And Trump has been eager to expand the tech industry’s US footprint and cement America as a leader in artificial intelligence. But the losses across Big Tech indicate that Silicon Valley will also face a slew of new challenges in the wake of uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans, which heavily target supply chains in Asia where tech companies source components and assemble products. Despite Trump’s pause on “reciprocal” tariffs that had been set to apply to many US trading partners, tariffs on China will increase to 125% from 104%. And while tariffs pose a direct challenge to tech giants, their economic ripple effects could also have negative implications if consumers and advertisers tighten their purse strings. Analysts had warned that long-term reciprocal tariffs, and the resulting economic uncertainty, could shrink tech earnings by as much as 25%, according to a Sunday report from UBS. That would mark a big shift from the relatively steady profit and share price gains that Big Tech has enjoyed in recent years thanks to AI. On Monday, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Trump’s tariff policy as an “Armageddon” for the tech sector, adding that it “makes the tech investing landscape the most difficult I have seen in 25 years covering tech stocks.” Meta, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and a representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Musk has experienced the most dramatic losses. Despite donating at least $290 million to support Trump’s reelection and his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, the world’s richest man’s net worth has plunged $143 billion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index data from April 8. That’s due largely to the sharp decline in Tesla shares, weighed down by Musk’s controversial work in the government, increasing competition and now, the threat of tariffs. Tesla shares fell 28% and its market capitalization dropped $376.6 billion since the start of this year, as of market close on April 9, having largely erased its post-election gains. Musk has said tariffs could have a “significant” impact on Tesla. While Musk may be in the spotlight due to his proximity to Trump, he’s not the only prominent tech figure to experience recent losses. (The most recent net worth data available on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is from April 8; the scale of their losses may be smaller after the market’s rebound Wednesday.) Meta was one of the first big companies to pledge a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg has met with Trump repeatedly, both before and after he took office, to discuss policy priorities. Zuckerberg also made several Trump-friendly changes to his business, including elevating a prominent Republican to the company’s top policy job, cutting professional fact-checkers and adding Trump ally and UFC boss Dana White to Meta’s board of directors. Zuckerberg’s net worth has fallen by $26.5 billion since the start of 2025. Meta’s share price has declined nearly 2.25% year-to-date, dragging down the company’s valuation by $35.8 billion. Bezos was quick to congratulate Trump on his election win in November, calling it an “extraordinary political comeback,” and Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Bezos was also behind The Washington Post’s controversial decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Bezos’ net worth has declined by $47.2 billion since the start of this year, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s shares are down 13% year-to-date, bringing the company’s total valuation down by $316.8 billion since the start of this year. Google donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and streamed the event live on YouTube. And Pichai joined the parade of CEOs who visited Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the election. But Google’s stock has now fallen 16.2%, and its valuation is down $386.7 billion since the start of this year. Apple’s Cook also personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, Axios reported in January, after meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election to discuss tariffs and European tech regulations. Apple also handed Trump a political win earlier this year when it announced a $500 billion investment in US facilities over the next four years. Although some of those plans were likely in place before Trump took office, the president claimed credit for the move, saying it showed “faith in what we are doing.” But Apple, which produces many of its gadgets in foreign markets such as China, Vietnam and India, is expected to take an especially big hit from Trump’s tariffs. Its stock is down 18.5% from the start of this year, and $684 billion has been shaved off its market value. During Trump’s first term, many big tech companies lobbied for exemptions from Trump’s tariffs. This time, however, the situation is much less certain, a point that analysts at Moody’s Ratings made in a recent research note. “While it is difficult to estimate the effects,” the analysts wrote, “we believe no technology subsector will go unharmed.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

April 09, 2025 18:58 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

WB Discovery’s stock surges 20% after the president’s announcement A number of media and tech stocks suddenly leaped higher on Wednesday afternoon, after President Trump stunned Wall Street by announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that are currently negotiating with the U.S. on new trade deals. Comcast and Netflix enjoyed big jumps on Wednesday, with each company seeing its share price increase more than 7%, while WB Discovery’s stock price surged 20.62% by the time markets closed. Apple, meanwhile, increased 15.33% to about $199 per share — a welcome sight for investors in the world’s most valuable company, after it shed nearly $1 trillion from its market cap over the last four trading days. “I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” the president posted on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The announcement sent the three major indexes soaring higher, with the S&P 500 up 9.52%, the Dow Jones up 7.87%, and the Nasdaq up 12.62% by the time trading ended on Wednesday. It was the largest single-day percentage jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq since 2001 and its second-largest ever, while the S&P 500 had its biggest day since 2008, per CNBC. Other tech and media stocks that are up big include: Fox Corp.: +8.56% News Corp.: +9.22% Roku: +15.90% Amazon: +11.98% Meta: +14.76% Simultaneously, President Trump said he was increasing the tariff against China to 125% — hours after a new 104% tariff against Chinese goods went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The jump for the three major indexes comes after brutal stretch for Wall Street bulls, following the president’s unveiling of his “liberation day” tariff plan last week. Overall, the downturn was the sharpest Wall Street had experienced since COVID-19 rocked the markets in March 2020. Earlier on Wednesday, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had warned a recession was “likely” if the new tariff plan remained in place, echoing the fears many other business bigwigs and Wall Street analysts have shared in the past week. That sentiment appeared to suddenly shift on Wednesday afternoon, with prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman lauding the president on X. “This was brilliantly executed by @RealDonaldTrump,” Ackman posted. “Textbook, Art of the Deal.” President Trump, as markets opened earlier in the day, urged Americans to “BE COOL!” on Truth Social, saying “everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” He then added moments later “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY,” followed by three exclamation points. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said countries were “falling over themselves” to make deals with the U.S. Trump, in his Truth Social post on Wednesday, said more than 75 countries had reached out about making trade deals.

Title: Tech CEOs Bent Over Backwards for Trump and Their "Reward" Has Been Horrible
URL: https://futurism.com/tech-ceos-trump-reward
Time Published: 2025-04-09T13:06:04Z
Full Content:
Tech CEOs spent millions of dollars on donations to president Donald Trump's campaign and inauguration, and by bending the knee after he was elected. But instead of facing a reinvigorated and less regulated tech market in return, they've instead gotten a kick in the teeth. As the New York Times reports, Trump's disastrous tariff war has caused the global stock market to crater, sending economic uncertainty soaring. And the global supply chains that big tech companies have been relying on for decades have been thrown into chaos. Even investment in the hottest thing in tech right now — artificial intelligence — could take a massive hit, as the cost of building out already-expensive data centers is expected to rise dramatically. It's a bizarre situation. Trump himself has appeared keen to keep the AI gravy train going, overseeing the signing of a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal dubbed Stargate. Yet his trade war could make AI companies' commitments difficult to hold up in the longterm as foreign-made chips could soon spike in price. In short, Trump's trade war could lead to a major falling out with big tech. Apple, in particular, has felt the hurt, reportedly flying planes full of iPhones into the US ahead of Trump's latest round of tariffs coming into effect. That's despite Apple CEO Tim Cook cozying up to Trump, donating $1 million to his inauguration and promising to spend half a trillion dollars in the US back in February. But despite paying lip service to the idea of moving manufacturing to the US, Apple hasn't fulfilled that promise for any of its major products. Instead, it tried to lower its reliance on China by moving assembly lines to India and Vietnam instead — countries that have since been hit with 26 and 46 percent tariffs, respectively. Tech CEOs who were hoping to encounter fewer regulatory hurdles with the Trump administration could soon face even more headwinds. The White House has signaled that it's looking to continue Biden-era antitrust cases looking to break up big tech companies, per the NYT. "Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!" Trump wrote in a January post on Truth Social. In short, tech leaders' efforts to get in the president's good graces are far from paying off. Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House to beg him to settle an antitrust lawsuit against the company. Legislators are worried Trump could simply drop the case, an investigation that has been going on for almost six years. Even after prostrating himself to Trump, though, it's easy to imagine that the president will simply allow the case to proceed.

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. US extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X. Asian stock markets surged on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for 75 countries, including India. This decision brought some relief to global investors amid rising trade tensions.Asian markets surge after Trump announces 90-day pause on tariffs, Indian markets closed for Mahavir Jayanti Asian stock markets surge after Trump announces 90-day tariff pause for 75 countries, including India, amid rising trade tensions. Asian stock markets surge after Trump announces 90-day tariff pause for 75 countries, including India, amid rising trade tensions. China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). Instead, GTRI said, India should consider a limited “Zero-to-Zero” tariff deal on 90 per cent of industrial goods, a model already offered by Europe to the U.S. Read more GTRI report warned that a full FTA with the US could turn out to be a costly mistake. While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month. Factory deflation persisted for a 30th month, with the producer-price index recording a faster drop of 2.5% compared to 2.2% in February. The Philippines has reached out to the U.S. Trade Representative to explore potential trade negotiations, with the best outcome being a free-trade agreement, the Economic Affairs minister said on Thursday after Washington said it would pause planned tariffs. “Let’s see what we can negotiate,” Frederick Go told a media briefing. ( Reuters) China lowers yuan midpoint for sixth day to 19-month low against dollar, signaling PBOC's focus on stability amid trade war. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday. ( Reuters) Trump pauses some tariffs, but not on auto imports, drawing criticism from Michigan business and auto groups. Trump's financial advice on social media led to a surge in stocks, raising questions about market manipulation. Understanding financial terms like capitulation, bear market, and dead cat bounce is crucial during economic uncertainty and market fluctuations. US stocks surge after Trump announces temporary tariff pause, easing fears of recession and boosting market confidence. U.S. dollar rebounds against safe-haven currencies after Trump announces tariff pause, escalating trade confrontation with China. Wall Street indexes surge after Trump announces tariff pause, with Dow up 5.76%, S&P 6.46%, Nasdaq 8.04%. President Trump eases tariffs on most nations for 90 days, raises tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257.7 points, or 0.68%, at the open to 37,387.91. The S&P 500 fell 17.5 points, or 0.35%, at the open to 4,965.28, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 27.5 points, or 0.18%, to 15,295.441 at the opening bell. - Reuters China on Wednesday issued a risk alert for Chinese tourists travelling to the U.S., according to a statement from the culture and tourism ministry. The ministry said it reminded Chinese tourists to assess the risks of travelling to the U.S. and travel with caution, citing recent “deterioration of China-U.S. economic and trade relations and the domestic security situation in the U.S.”. - Reuters US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said he thinks the Trump administration can reach tariff deals with US allies as he prepares to lead negotiations with more than 70 countries in coming weeks, warning that moves to align more closely with China could backfire. Bessent, speaking to an American Bankers Association conference in Washington, said he would take a lead negotiating role in negotiations over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that despite financial market turmoil, “in general, the companies I’ve spoken to, people who have come, the CEOs, who have come into Treasury, tell me that the economy is very solid.” - Reuters China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen US defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.

Trump Truth Social Post President Donald Trump urged Americans to remain calm and continue investing on Wednesday as his sweeping reciprocal tariffs hit, in an indication the White House was closely monitoring market reaction to the levies. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY,” Trump said Wednesday in a post to his social media site. The president also encouraged his followers to “BE COOL” and added his prediction that “everything is going to work out well.” “The USA will be bigger and better than ever before,” he said. Wall Street’s main indexes were set to open sharply lower on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day. - Reuters President Donald Trump claimed world leaders were “dying to make a deal” with the US and would do anything to secure a pact on tariffs. “I am telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,” Trump said during a speech at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner on Tuesday. The president, who imposed a wide range of tariffs on various countries and triggered a global trade war, said: “They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything sir’.” Many new tariffs, announced by Trump on April 2, took effect on Wednesday morning. - PTI China needs to implement more proactive macroeconomic policies and roll them out in a timely manner as “external shocks” have put pressures to China’s economic stabilisation, Premier Li Qiang said on Wednesday, according to state media. - Reuters China and US escalate trade war with increasing tariffs on each other's goods, reaching up to 104%.

Title: When you can expect price hikes — and how severe they may be

Good morning. If you should ever meet Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, never compare him to Elon Musk. Huang's biographer learned this the hard way. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump's tariffs have gone into effect — we're looking at when you can expect prices to rise, and how severe they may be. What's on deck Markets: Why "The Big Short" investor Steve Eisman thinks the US would prevail in a global trade war. Tech: How grassroots rage at Elon Musk snowballed into global protests. Business: Zillow might not be the place to look for your dream home anymore, thanks to new rules. But first, time for an upgrade? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. $1,549 for an iPhone. After Trump's latest round of tariffs — which went into effect today — UBS's chief investment officer said the Mainland China-assembled iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256 GB would likely see a price hike of $350. The White House's total tariff rate for China now stands at 104%. BI spoke to seven analysts about rising consumer prices and found they expect costs to go up roughly 30% to 50%. It's not just Apple, either. A slew of companies have talked about raising prices due to Trump's tariffs, including Walmart and Target — BI has a running list of them here. Prices on everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to larger purchases like cars and appliances are expected to rise. A Yale economist estimated that the cost to the average household could be about $3,800 this year. "Shark Tank" investor Mark Cuban has suggested Americans begin stockpiling goods before prices go up: "From toothpaste to soap, anything you can find storage space for, buy before they have to replenish inventory," Cuban wrote. So, should you take Cuban's advice and stockpile essentials? Some Americans are. BI spoke with people who say they're buying makeup, skincare goods, pet food, spices, meat … the list goes on. Prices might not rise immediately. Companies may think twice before passing on the cost to consumers. Take Apple: Increasing prices could give competitors like Samsung — who are less affected by tariffs — a competitive edge, analyst Thomas Monteiro said. That said, if you know you'll need a new iPhone soon, it's not a bad idea to act now, BI's Ana Altchek writes. 1. "The Big Short" investor is bullish on Trump and the trade war. Steve Eisman thinks the US would win if tariff escalation develops into a full-on trade war. He's also confident President Trump could get everything he wants from negotiations "if reasonable heads prevail." 2. To buy — or not buy — the dip. There might be a glimmer of hope for the investors suffering through the brutal market sell-off. History suggests stocks could very well shake off these losses, and Truist's chief market strategist agrees: "This is not the time to be selling into panic." 3. History lessons about a looming bear market. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday amid a three-day skid triggered by Trump's tariffs. Goldman Sachs strategists argue the market is now flirting with an event-driven bear market. Here's what to expect if the stock market decisively enters one. 1. Rage against the (Elon Musk) machine. Tesla Takedown protests began sprouting up in February and by the end of March, they had reached more than 250 cities and 13 countries. Here's how anti-Tesla momentum evolved. 2. The angel investors shaking up Silicon Valley. There's a strong correlation between the rising number of women in angel investor markets and more female entrepreneurs receiving angel investing capital. It might be the best way for them to take on tech's billionaire boys club. 3. Microsoft middle managers, beware. The tech giant is considering another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, BI exclusively reports. This time, it's not just shedding low performers. Leaders on some teams are discussing ousting middle managers, people familiar with the matter told BI. 1. The golden age of Zillow is coming to an end. Thanks to new rules for real estate agents, sites like Zillow and Redfin are about to lose a lot of listings. Your dream home could be for sale — but you may never see it. 2. Top Trump donors are seeing their stock prices plunge. Billionaire CEOs of tech and finance companies shelled out donations to President Trump. Now they're watching their companies' stocks plunge after his tariff announcement. Here's how much they've lost in share value. 3. Trump threatened TSMC with a "big tax." The president said on Tuesday he'd slap Taiwan's chipmaker with a tax of up to 100% if it didn't build its plants in America. TSMC had already announced in March it will invest $100 billion to build five new chip factories in the US.

Title: What does a bear market mean for Big Tech?

Consumers won’t be buying as many gadgets during the potential downturn that’s slamming tech stocks, forecasts Daniel Newman of the Futurum Group. But the tariff-fueled disruption could widen giant companies’ advantage over the rest. After President Donald Trump's launched his “Liberation Day” tariff agenda, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index suffered its biggest plunge since March 2020. The so-called Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla — lost a combined $1.8 trillion of market value in two days. The tariff-induced downturn in business conditions is likely to be temporary, according to Daniel Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group, a tech research and advisory firm. Newman told Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino that tech consumers might feel more of the pain, but not much can stop corporate AI adoption and the data center buildout. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Daniel Newman: The consumer part of technology, I think, is really at risk with things like PCs and smartphones. We're saying, hey, we're going to build and screw in our iPhones here. Are we ready for $5,000 iPhones? So if I'm on the consumer side and I'm investing in a company like Apple, I'm really nervous right now, and I think this selling pressure on Apple, which has historically been a flight-to-safety name, is evident that people just don't know. They're not confident. And despite its half-trillion-dollar commitments to do more in the U.S. and even its comments about doing more in India, nobody seems to feel comfortable that the consumer demand will be there because that's also tied to things like recession. So that means a lot of things that smaller companies, individuals, buy become more at risk. Now, on the other side of this, I actually have spent time with a number of CEOs in the Big Tech and megacap companies, and both my perspective and theirs is that things like enterprise [artificial intelligence] and the buildout of the AI superhighway of the future, these big data centers — almost tariff-proof. And there's a couple reasons that it is. One is the large companies will double down on R&D and investment during down cycles. This will give them a meaningful advantage, knowing that at some point, no matter where we land with these tariffs, markets will normalize. People will adjust to it, and the markets will start to grow again. This will not be permanent downside. I do not believe it will be permanent downside, but the uncertainty, as long as it lasts, will come with a lot of either up-and-down whipsaw, like I said, or continued consternation, because the CEOs I talked to are also in a somewhat difficult position to make decisions. But the AI data center build, if I'm looking at companies like Nvidia, if I'm looking at companies like Microsoft that have relatively low consumer exposure, I'm feeling more optimistic. Meghan McCarty Carino: What exactly makes the data center business kind of tariff-proof? I think about kind of physical infrastructure building, we've heard a lot about how the housing market and, you know, building residential could become a lot more expensive. Data centers are also made of stuff that could be tariffed. Newman: Yeah, obviously there's a lot of kind of speculation, some of the continuation of USMCA and the no-tariffs-on-semiconductors [policy] right now is enabling a lot of at least fundamental belief before 232 is fully unpacked, and a longer-term semiconductor decision is being made that you could basically ship chips into the U.S. or Mexico, have these things assembled and avoid tariffs. Now, again, that's just the racks. That doesn't count all the other things that go into a data center. Steel, of course, you know, you've got major workforce issues. You know, we've got, obviously, the two sides of the immigration debate. We know what we're trying to accomplish with safety and security of our borders. But also we know that a large part of workforce that do things like build homes and buildings, maybe we have less access to that type of workforce, bringing input costs up. Of course, all the other things that go into these buildouts and facilities, energy, all things that are going to be up for debate in terms. But realistically, it's about the fact that companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, they have massive operating leverage, and so during this sort of market recession or downturn, they will separate themselves from startups that may have trouble raising meaningful capital, from midsize and growing competitors in the middle of the market that won't be able to invest as heavily. They can build out their data centers faster. They can have the capacity in place. And knowing that this tech is deflationary, I think that's kind of it. There's a tariff element to it, and then there's a fact that companies can actually be more profitable by implementing tech. We saw this in 2022 in the downturn when [quantitative tightening] started, software investment in many companies went up. They invested heavily in platforms that were either automation platforms, analytics platforms that could allow them to more efficiently make decisions while keeping head counts in place. And we actually saw from 2022 to 2024, Big Tech didn't really raise head counts, even though earnings grew considerably. McCarty Carino: When it comes to share prices, I think a lot of people are sort of like playing a tiny violin for these companies with the biggest market caps in the world. The market caps are slightly smaller than they were, but still absolutely enormous. But, I mean, at a kind of basic level, why are capital markets important to any company, but especially to tech companies? Newman: Well, I mean, there's a few different reasons capital markets are important. Of course, there's the literal ability to continually raise needed capital to run the business. These large companies don't have as much of that type of need. They're also a litmus test for how the market perceives a certain company or a certain category. And of course, it's also part of, at least as I see it, American exceptionalism, that the U.S. companies are seen as the world's most valuable companies. [The capital markets are] also full of sort of abnormal actions over short periods of time. But over long periods of time, the market does tend to be a very strong indicator for these companies and for the health of an economy and the health of businesses. McCarty Carino: And for that reason, U.S. capital markets, and especially tech stocks, have been a good place to put money for investors all over the world. That is good for our companies that they attract investment. So what does it mean for tech companies for markets to potentially be in bear territory? Newman: Well, for the tech companies, I think most of these, especially these Mag 7 and large tech companies, I think it really just means battening down the hatches, staying really focused, investing in the right [research and development], not overleveraging and continuing to serve the customers and deliver the innovation and solutions that has gotten them to where they're going. These large companies have incredible operating leverage. And you look at some of them, like Nvidia is supposed to create $100 billion in cash in the next year. Their share price dropping and their market cap going from $3.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion doesn't change their ability to function and operate. And I think these companies have strong [barriers to competition], they have strong customer bases, they have strong margins, and even in periods of recessions, they're generally growing their earnings. Now the expectation for earnings growth sometimes slows, but these companies have strong businesses that continue to grow. They continue to create cash flow. And I think over time, if you can handle the kind of the uncertainty and buy when things seem most uncomfortable, there's endless history and proof points that people that bought during these times do a lot better than those that sort of chase these names into bull markets. McCarty Carino: We've been talking about Big Tech, but what are the kind of ripple effects for little tech, for startups in this kind of an environment? Newman: There's a lot more risk for smaller companies and small tech. You got to watch for a signal. You know, we work with 600 of the world's largest tech companies. The signal that we look for as a smaller company working with many of the larger ones is, when does their spending slow down? Meaning, do you start to see meaningful behavior changes coming from your larger clients? Are they actually slowing their spending down? That signal is often one that smaller tech companies need to look at. You need to be on top of how technology can help. You need to be very focused on delivering great value to your existing customers and just listen to your large customers, because they will tell you. The large customers tend to know when they need to slow spending and when they start slowing spending, you need to slow spending for sure. McCarty Carino: This isn't the first shock that the tech sector has weathered. In fact, the tech sector seems to have more of them than other industries. How would you sort of put this in perspective of the kind of history of ups and downs in the tech industry and what we can kind of learn from those? Newman: We're going to go through cycles every handful of years. And actually, with the diffusion of innovation speeding up, and the diffusion of information speeding up, I actually think cycles happen at more rapid pace. But the one thing I think we all tend to underestimate is sort of the perseverance. You know, the human condition is we come back from adversity and we come back stronger. The tariffs obviously impact technology, but we will accelerate, and we will continue to innovate, and it will be technology that will get us out of these most difficult situations. It's proven time and time again. So owning the names in tech, it's very hard to bet against over the long term.

Activate your online access Trump’s tariff war is chaotic, but there is no way out of neoliberal globalization without some form of protectionism. A shipping container is moved at the Port Jersey Container Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 8, 2025. United Auto Workers (UAW) president Shawn Fain has many liberals scratching their heads. The longtime critic of Donald Trump who wore a “TRUMP IS A SCAB” T-shirt at the Democratic National Convention last year has come out in support of the president’s favorite economic policy: tariffs. Despite the fact that other leading progressives have expressed extreme alarm at Trump’s plans, Fain has insisted that tariffs are “a tool in the toolbox…to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers.” He’s right, and he’s not alone in thinking this. A group of self-proclaimed “economic patriots” on the left are making a similar case in Congress. Representative Chris Deluzio, a Democrat from Western Pennsylvania who won election in the state’s most competitive district, recently took to The New York Times to plead with his party not to embrace “anti-tariff absolutism” as a response to Trump’s policies. And Representative Jared Golden, a Democrat from a rural Trump-leaning district in Maine, recently made a similar case, arguing, “Tariffs are a first step in rewriting a rigged trade system.” Tariffs are part of any sound trade policy. The way they work is simple: By raising the prices of foreign goods, you make domestic goods more attractive to domestic consumers, thus increasing demand and expanding homegrown production. Of course, Trump’s tariffs are erratic, and their intended purpose is unclear. They will likely do more harm than good. But that doesn’t mean protectionism is inherently a bad idea. In fact, if the left cannot offer a compelling exit from neoliberal globalization, it will be unable to effectively combat the GOP’s national populism with a social populism of its own. Rethinking trade must be a central part of a pro-worker agenda. For many union members, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) marks the beginning of US decline. The agreement made it so that money, goods, and labor could flow more freely across the continent. Since it was enthusiastically signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993, manufacturing jobs have drained out of the United States to lower-wage corners of the globe. And NAFTA wasn’t even the worst of it; a succession of trade deals followed, including the admission of China into the World Trade Organization. This led to a collapse of manufacturing jobs in the United States. In the 30 years since, around 90,000 US manufacturing plants have been shuttered. The impact on the labor movement has been disastrous. In 1990, around 20 percent of workers in the US belonged to a union; by 2024 that rate had plummeted to around 9 percent, a record low. The decline of manufacturing and union density combined with looser border restrictions that invited hyper-exploited foreign-born workers into the United States have crushed wages, which have been stagnant for non-college-educated workers. By swapping high-wage often union jobs in manufacturing, for low-wage nonunion jobs in services, free trade has effectively robbed the working class of its social, political, and economic power. Few industrial unions have been as affected as the UAW. Since the 1990s, the autoworkers have witnessed over 60 major plant closures among the Big Three automakers. Membership in the union peaked at around 1.5 million in 1979. Today, the UAW has around 390,000 members—a 74 percent decrease. Worse, even when the union manages to make inroads in new plants, companies always have an exit option. They can pack up and relocate to places where labor is cheaper. What’s more, layoffs and plant closures have had a devastating effect on the towns and cities that depended on industrial wages and investments. While some economists insist that job losses in manufacturing have been offset by the arrival of cheap goods from China (and ever-rising stock prices), they discount the devastating social, psychological, and political effects of plant closures. The mounting “deaths of despair” and rise of opioid addiction, concentrated in working-class former industrial cities and towns, indicate a social rot that began with the country’s embrace of free trade. Politically, despite Bill Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s confidence that a super-charged global “knowledge economy” would generate broad-based prosperity that would reward progressives, the results have not been good for Democrats. In fact, as wages stagnated, working-class voters have drifted away from the party. No Democratic candidate for president has ever matched Bill Clinton’s level of support with these voters. Lyndon Johnson feared that he lost the South for a generation by passing civil rights laws, but liberals seem unaware that by signing NAFTA, Democrats did the same for blue-collar workers. Obama even tried to deepen the disaster with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was never ratified. By 2016, the populist backlash had arrived. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders slammed the establishment for disastrous trade deals. And both won a larger share of working-class voters than their establishment counterparts. And the United States wasn’t alone. A recent meta-analysis by political scientists, led by Gábor Scheiring at Georgetown University, found that the surge in populism all over the world is driven by a reaction against the insecurity induced by globalization. While debate remains over whether workers were driven away from the left because of economic issues or cultural ones, with globalization the two phenomena are linked—the same market forces that drove manufacturing to extinction also helped to drive the increasing pace of cultural churn. Of course, globalization didn’t only generate losers. Skilled professionals have done well under free trade. Those with advanced degrees plugged into the knowledge-city hubs that dot the globe have seen salary increases over the last 30 years, and they’ve reaped significant consumer rewards as well, from the arrival of cheaper foreign goods to the arrival of cheaper foreign labor, like nannies and maids. One consequence of their relative economic success, however, is that the educated middle classes have pulled away from the working class socially, politically, and culturally. Ironically, as the white-collar class became more liberal, they became less aware of the economic interests or aspirations of their blue-collar counterparts—which explains their constant exasperation that someone of modest means might vote for Trump. Not only this, but because of the nature of their work, professionals maintain effective control of the means of cultural production, and they’ve, perhaps unwittingly, imposed their own aesthetic and cosmopolitan tastes on the broader public. One way to think of the culture wars is as a process of elite cultural reeducation. The academy, the media, and the sprawling nonprofit industrial complex has, since the 1990s, insisted upon new ways of speaking, writing, and thinking that quickly become litmus tests for whether one is considered moral by the liberal literati. This process has only exacerbated working-class resentment: Not only has globalization not worked out for the working class economically, but culturally they’re now expected to ape the values of their social betters. But none have benefited as much as Wall Street, the über-rich, and the multinational mega-corporations. The wealthy reap rewards on both sides of the globalization gambit. They rake in record profits off cheap labor in foreign countries where unions and workplace rights are weak or nonexistent. And they benefit from the privileged position the new global order affords them. The freedom to invest and divest in whatever country they choose gives the rich immense power over the world’s poor, whose governments clamor to attract new investment by depressing wages and promising investors freedom from taxes and regulation. The result is that the rich have grown much richer. In 1990, CEOs made roughly 76 times what their typical employee made, by 2023 that number grew to 290 times. Over the same period, the number of billionaires in the United States has grown by more than 1,000 percent. Since 2024 their wealth, through the magic of finance, has grown by $3.9 trillion. These numbers are mind-boggling, but as Labor Institute director Les Leopold usefully put it: “If you earned $1,000 per hour, it would take you 68.5 years to reach $1 billion.” Put another way, you don’t earn a billion dollars. You steal it. What’s been the upshot for the economy overall? Nothing great. As the population of billionaires ballooned, the high growth rates promised by free-trade enthusiasts never arrived. Larry Summers, once an economic adviser to the hyper-globalizing Clinton administration, has recently expressed doubt in the possibility for renewed global growth. Superrich people, it seems, are far more likely to save their money than plow it into engines of economic dynamism. Meanwhile, the rest of us don’t have adequate wages to spend. The suppression of mass demand means that, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, “The U.S. Economy Depends More Than Ever on Rich People.” And all because neoliberal globalization broke the back of labor all over the world. As the German political economist Wolfgang Streeck said, “Without trade unions, no mass purchasing power; without mass purchasing power, no investment.” And what about Mexico? Some of globalization’s dead-enders insist that without free trade, workers in countries like Mexico would be a lot poorer. But even this seems dubious. For years the unwritten accord with Mexican auto workers was that, while they would have lower wages than their American counterparts, their plants would employ a lot more labor. Wages would be spread around. Yet today high-tech automation imported from all over the globe is employed to displace Mexican workers—a phenomenon known as “premature deindustrialization.” Mexican workers have suffered hyper-exploitation at the hands of foreign multinational corporations for decades, and now those same corporations are laying off the cheap labor they relied on to lay off American workers. It’s clear, after 30 years, this system isn’t working for the working class. This brings us back to Shawn Fain. Fain knows that Trump’s tariffs are dangerous. He knows that chaos creates economic risks. He knows that Trump’s anti-labor record is not going to benefit US or foreign workers. But he also knows that there is a big division in the political and business class right now, and he’s keen to exploit it. Wall Street hates the tariffs; the political establishment hates the tariffs; even Elon Musk seems to hate the tariffs. Trump’s signature economic policy has the potential to crack up his coalition. It’s in moments like these that a new common sense can form. In some ways the post-globalized order is already here. Global trade has stagnated since the 2008 crisis, and the public has no appetite for another NAFTA-type free-trade agreement. Yet what comes next is uncertain. Right now, in the debate over trade there seem to be only two voices: Wall Street or Trump. Fain offers a better vision than both. Jacqueline Sweet Sasha Abramsky Jeet Heer Alex Peter Fain is right when he argues that auto manufacturers can afford to eat the tariffs without passing on price hikes. Consider that, despite labor-saving automation, manufacturers were charging record prices for a new car before tariffs—in some cases 10 points above the general inflation rate. Where is that money going? Into auto-industry profits that have grown over 50 percent since 2019—despite depressed sales. Fain is right that the industry has “excess capacity” and that tariffs “could bring work back in very short order” by reopening recently closed or underutilized plants. And he’s right that tariffs, combined with an effective industrial policy, could boost workers’ wages, not just in the auto industry but across the board. But more than all of this, Fain is right that we need to restore democratic sovereignty over our economy. The kind of protectionism he envisions has been a “tool in the toolbox” throughout the history of the labor movement. In some ways it’s the foundational idea of progressive economics. Alexander Hamilton, who was so recently the subject of much liberal admiration, was a huge fan of tariffs. So was the most important progressive economist of all time, John Maynard Keynes. And as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik argues, the major “trilemma” of the free-trade regime is precisely that we cannot maintain “hyperglobalization, democracy, and national sovereignty all at once; we can have at most, two out of three.” Too many liberals are now rejoicing at Wall Street’s rejection of the tariffs as if “the markets” are a substitute for democratic input. But plunging stocks only prove what we already knew: that high finance is loath to get off the free-trade gravy train. The turmoil itself demonstrates how hard it is to implement any kind of economic control over the financial paymasters, and it will surely signal to many of Trump’s supporters that he is taking on the elite. It’s right to be clear-eyed about Trump’s recklessness; indeed, Keynes warned that a move away from globalism “should not be a matter of tearing up roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction.” Trump has no patience for that, but the left can’t fall into the trap of letting Wall Street set the terms of the debate. To match Trump’s national populism, we need a social populism of our own. We should not retreat to advocating for free trade as a response to stock market panic but advance to a conversation about industrial planning. We need a program that seeks to repatriate American finance, claw back the trillions in taxes lost to offshore banking, and reinvest in US jobs. The tariff is one of the tools we need to rebuild the economy in favor of the working class. Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the Director of Operations for Teamsters Local 623. A president who bullies Congress kowtows to the bond market. Jeet Heer I don’t know exactly what went down in the hours before Trump publicly announced a “pause” on tariffs, but it merits investigation. Sasha Abramsky The fallout from Trump’s tariff plans has pitted the Republican financial elite against MAGA culture warriors in a way that threatens to split the coalition. Chris Lehmann The president’s tariff war is also a constitutional crisis. Jeet Heer The economy took an immediate hit after the president’s “Liberation Day ”announcement. Chris Lehmann New trade barriers are going to reduce demand for US exports while increasing the cost of living domestically. This will only worsen conditions in the manufacturing sector.

Title: On the Opaque Origins and Tumultuous Ancient History of Homer’s Odyssey

Full Content:
In some ways, the Odyssey needs no introduction: it is everywhere around us. Over the nearly thirty centuries since Homer’s thrilling epic about the hero Odysseus’s homecoming from the Trojan War began to circulate, its story, characters, and themes have become so tightly woven into the fabric of our literature and art, music and drama, that they seem to us inevitable, natural. It’s with a start that we recall that someone had to invent them. Whether you’re reading Virgil’s Aeneid or watching The Wizard of Oz or Finding Nemo, you are enjoying a story that borrows the Odyssey’s plot: a hero, separated from home and loved ones, must wander among strange peoples and fantastical places during a difficult and often dangerous journey before arriving at last to reclaim both family and homeland. As you make your way through Dante’s Inferno, J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, or Stephen King’s Stand by Me, you are following a metaphorical arc first traced by Homer: the journey through space and time as a symbol for intellectual growth and discovery, for a deepening appreciation of the relationship of the self to the world, for the trajectory, finally, that we all follow from birth to death. The most suspenseful and exciting of the Odyssey’s plot twists—when the hero finally returns, he is in disguise and can thus secretly test the loyalty of those he left behind—has been endlessly recycled, from authors such as Alexandre Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo) to filmmakers such as Ridley Scott (Gladiator). And the climactic testing of the Odyssey’s hero, who must prove both his identity and his worthiness to assume his destined role by meeting a series of challenges both physical and mental, has resurfaced in modern epics like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The Odyssey bequeathed to the West entire genres. The poem’s fascination with the alien creatures and unfamiliar cultures that its wandering hero confronts was the seed from which both fantasy literature and science fiction would eventually blossom; Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Star Trek share strands of an Odyssean DNA. The Odyssey also established the blueprint for the picaresque novel, whose rollicking narratives about sly characters barely scraping their way through a series of hair-raising escapades, from Don Quixote to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, echo Odysseus’s progress from Troy (where the ingenious ruse he dreamed up, the Trojan Horse, won the war) through encounters with monsters, seductresses, and ghosts, to Ithaka, the home he strives so hard to reach. The marital drama of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope—a couple agonizingly separated, the man and woman each facing different kinds of peril, eventually reunited only after a tense test of wits proves to each that the other is an ideal mate—contains the germ of all romantic comedy. The pleasure readers experience when Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy finally come together at the end of Pride and Prejudice is a direct descendant of an emotion experienced by Homer’s audience thirty centuries ago as they listened to a bard sing of the reunion of Ithaka’s royal couple, fully revealed to each other at last after a separation of twenty years. The Odyssey has provided inspiration for a number of important modernist and contemporary authors. James Joyce’s 1922 classic Ulysses (the title uses the Roman name for Homer’s wandering hero) is composed of sections that are both named for and modeled on episodes of Homer’s epic: “Circe,” “Proteus,” “Lotos-Eaters,” and so forth. Motifs and characters from both the Iliad and the Odyssey resurface in Omeros, a 1990 epic poem on themes of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade by the St. Lucian writer Derek Walcott, winner of the Nobel Prize, while the American poet Louise Glück, also a Nobel laureate, examined a collapsing marriage through a retelling of the Odyssey in her 1996 collection Meadowlands. More recently, numerous women writers have taken the epic’s female characters and reimagined the events of Homer’s story from their points of view. In books such as Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad and Madeline Miller’s Circe, the reorientation of narrative perspective reminds us that the ancient works, originally composed by men for primarily male audiences, are nonetheless rich in complex female characters whose literary potential is still being tapped. The large themes of Homer’s epic have proved to be enduring ones. The poem’s presentation of Odysseus as someone whose desperation to return home is tempered by an endless curiosity about the strange places through which he wanders provokes questions about how we navigate between the allure of adventure and the satisfactions of home. The depiction of the poem’s protagonist as a gritty survivor who—in stark contrast to the haughty warriors of the Iliad, for whom dying young in battle is a fair price to pay for everlasting glory—will stoop to virtually anything in order to stay alive demands that we reevaluate what we mean by the word “hero.” Odysseus’s fraught interactions with immortals such as the nymph Kalypso, whose offer of eternal life and youth he rejects in favor of returning to his aging wife, force us, like the hero, to grapple with the meaning of mortality and the value of human love, even as his relationships with his wife, his bedmates, his son, and his father offer insights into the relations between men and women, parents and children. And the epic’s complex portrayal of its morally ambivalent main character—a man whose impressive intellectual gifts, technological expertise, and “godlike” cunning nonetheless very often leave destruction and sorrow in their wake—often reads like a dark parable about Western civilization itself. The Odyssey further displays a marked interest in a subject that some readers are more likely to associate with the work of twentieth-century modernist writers: the workings of language and rhetoric, the nature of poetry and literature. Odysseus’s expertise as a talented raconteur (and, when the occasion demands, an expert liar), along with the epic’s many scenes of him and other characters telling, exchanging, and enjoying a tale whose point is clearly self-serving, raises tricky questions about the uses of narrative and its relationship to truth. Meanwhile, the Odyssey’s frequent references to and depictions of poets, singers, and bards, along with repeated episodes in which professional bards—like Homer himself—give performances on whose formal qualities and emotional power other characters comment, can lend the proceedings a startlingly “meta,” even postmodern feel. Strikingly modern, too, is the Odyssey’s sophisticated inquiry into the nature of identity. The vehicle for that investigation is the poem’s constantly shifting presentation of its chameleon-like hero, whose adeptness at both falsifying his appearance and fictionalizing his life story makes it almost impossible to trust what we think we know about him—and, hence, impossible to know who he is. The issue is slyly raised already in the Odyssey’s opening line, which avoids naming its protagonist, referring to him instead simply as “a man.” Not very helpfully, that same first line allots this nameless man precisely one adjective—polytropos, literally “having many twists and turns”—which, at once vague and yet suggestive of endless possibilities, seems intended simultaneously to illuminate and to confound our understanding of just who this man might be. Over the twelve thousand one hundred nine lines that follow that opening, we see so many “turns” or facets of this character that it sometimes feels as if he is becoming more, rather than less, difficult to grasp as his story proceeds. * And so we can read the Odyssey today with a bracing sense of déjà vu: we feel we know these narratives, we have met these characters, we recognize these themes. Yet the epic of Odysseus’s return is, in many ways, as unfathomably strange to us as the one-eyed giant Cyclops was to its hero. Its origins, even after centuries of scholarly investigations, are opaque, its poetic conventions sometimes off puttingly foreign, certain of its values passé when not outright repugnant. Small wonder. The Odyssey is the product of the civilization of Archaic Greece—that is, Greece before the classical era, before the “golden age” of Pericles, Greek tragedy, Athenian democracy, the Parthenon. That civilization flourished between around 750 BCE, when the Iliad and the Odyssey likely began circulating, and around 500 BCE—the moment when the Athenian democracy was established. But the civilization described in the Odyssey had flourished another half millennium earlier, in the final stage of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600—1150 BCE). This was the civilization of Greek kingdoms such as Mycenae, Argos, Tiryns, and Pylos, of the luxurious and sophisticated cities of Knossos on Crete and of Troy in Asia Minor. These states, known as “palace-cultures,” were organized around a royal palace, or megaron, as the center of social, political, and economic activity, and each palace was presided over by its warrior-king. The principal characters in both the Iliad and Odyssey are such kings: Odysseus of Ithaka, Achilles of Phthía, Nestor of Pylos, Menelaos of Sparta, Agamemnon of Mycenae. Between 1200 and 1150 BCE, nearly all these cities were destroyed, probably as the result of both natural disasters (drought, earthquakes, fires) and of economic and political upheavals. During the centuries after the fall of the Bronze Age palace-cultures—a period of such greatly reduced literacy and such minimal large-scale building and craft production that it was long referred to as Greece’s “Dark Ages”—the tales Homer would later tell about the Trojan War began circulating, aglow with idealized reminiscences of the civilization that had so suddenly vanished. These tales eventually coalesced into a grand sequence of epic verse narratives known as the Epic Cycle. Composed by various poets and together comprising many tens of thousands of lines and at least seventy-seven “books”—that is, papyrus scrolls—this cycle traced the arc of the war from its distant prehistory (the wedding of the parents of Achilles, the Greeks’ greatest warrior) through its proximate cause (the Trojan prince Paris’s seduction of Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaos), to the events of the Trojan War itself, culminating in the Sack of Troy; and thereafter the adventures of a number of the Greek warriors as they returned home (related in an epic known as the Nostoi, or “Returns”). The final bizarre ramification of the cycle’s most attenuated plotline was the slaying of Odysseus, in his old age, by his son Telégonos, his child by the witch Circe, related in a work called the Telegony, at the conclusion of which Telégonos marries Penelope and Telémakhos marries Circe(!). Of this cycle, only fragments and summaries survive. The only two complete epics about the Trojan War that have come down to us are the Iliad, about events that took place during the final year of the war, and the Odyssey, about the nostos, or “return,” of one particular hero. Scholars continue to debate the relationship between those two epics and the Epic Cycle: which came first, and which inspired the other. As distant as they were from each other, both the civilization that the Odyssey commemorates and the civilization that produced the epic shared a number of features that are profoundly alien to modern sensibilities. For one thing, both were deeply patriarchal cultures. Although they played key roles in religion and cults, women had no political rights or status, could not own property, and were themselves often little more than chattel, objects of exchange whose chief role was to produce children and perform homely domestic tasks. (Even the queens in the Homeric epics, from Helen of Troy to Penelope, are often depicted engaged in spinning and weaving; so, too, the goddesses Kalypso and Circe.) The economies of these cultures, moreover, were based largely on the labor of enslaved people—prisoners taken in war, victims of forced abductions—who, like many of the slaves depicted in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, spent their lives performing work both domestic and agricultural for masters who expected their loyalty as a matter of course. Hence, like other great works of literature from remote eras and different cultures, the Homeric epics present us with a classic conundrum: How can a work that seems to speak with such truth about so much that matters to us have been produced by a culture with certain institutions and values so alien to us? Only an attentive reading of the poem can begin to forge an answer to that question. As to the poem’s formal conventions, they are likely to strike modern readers as equally inscrutable. You don’t have to progress very far into the text before you notice a number of peculiarities unlike anything familiar from other literary encounters. Of these, the high degree of repetition is likely to be the most striking. Not only do most characters have descriptive epithets that are repeated nearly every time their names appear—“Athena of the bright owl-eyes,” “Telémakhos, sensible lad,” “Penelope, clear-thinking woman”—but entire lines and even whole passages are repeated, verbatim, throughout the poem. Scenes of feasting, for instance, nearly always include the line “Then they stretched out their hands toward the food that was spread before them,” while the end of the meal is just as regularly signaled by the phrase “But once they had put away their craving for drink and for food…” Between those two moments, Homer often repeats the following five-line passage, describing the dinner preparations and service: A maidservant brought in water, pouring it out from a ewer— Exquisite, wrought in gold—into a basin of silver, For the guest to wash his hands. Then she placed a table nearby. The housekeeper, worthy woman, brought the meal and served it, Glad to have so many dishes to set out from her storerooms inside. (1.136–40) Such devices were, in fact, almost certainly the products of the distinctive manner in which the epics were composed and transmitted—which is to say, not in writing but orally. The texts of both epics were long thought to have been the work of a single genius named Homer, who wrote his poems. Scholars began to reconsider the origins of the poems, however, in the late eighteenth century, when a manuscript of the Iliad containing not only the text of the epic but transcriptions of the “scholia”—the marginal notes by various ancient commentators that had accreted over the centuries—was discovered in Venice. These precious annotations were of enormous value in their own right, since relatively little has survived of the vast body of ancient scholarship and commentary on Homer, which was often impressively erudite. (The Roman geographer Strabo, a contemporary of the emperor Augustus, makes reference to a thirty-volume work by someone called Demetrius of Skepsis that treated just sixty-two lines of the second book of the Iliad.) But what was so exciting about the marginalia in the Venetian manuscript was that many of the notes, which referred to a number of ancient editions of the poems, concerned questions that the ancient commentators had about the authenticity of certain lines and passages. If the epics had been penned by a single author, scholars wondered, why were there so many variants already in ancient times? Could the authentic text by Homer be recovered by judiciously sifting through the variant versions? By the early nineteenth century, the Venetian manuscript and the writings of those who had studied it were roiling the intellectual and literary worlds by raising a different set of questions. What if there were no authentic Homeric versions of the poems—what if, indeed, there had been no Homer in the first place? As the century progressed, more and more classicists were persuaded that the epics must originally have been composed by illiterate oral poets in an era before the Greeks adopted an alphabet and writing became widespread; the Iliad and Odyssey, they argued, could not have been the work of a single bard but instead represented an accumulation of smaller, self-contained poems (or “lays”) composed by different poets of different eras. Adherents of one school of thought, known as “Analysts”—from the Greek word analyô, “to break [something] down into its component parts”—claimed to be able to distinguish among the various strata of composition in each of the epics; some insisted that they could make out “original” versions of the poems lurking beneath the layers. The Analysts were opposed by so-called “Unitarians,” who continued to insist that the poems, whatever flaws in consistency and irregularities in style and coherence they might occasionally display, were the product of a single genius. The debate about the authorship and transmission of the epics, known as the “Homeric Question,” raged on into the twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, a classicist named Milman Parry proposed a theory, based on an insight he had into Homer’s verbatim repetitions, that transformed the way we understand how the epics were composed. Parry suggested that those repeated lines, passages, and epithets—the latter almost always occurring in the same position within a line of verse—must have functioned as prefabricated placeholders for oral poets who composed their works in performance. The rigidly formulaic nature of the repetitions, he argued, were traces of a poetic process that combined memorization of traditional elements with improvisation: if the bard knew in advance how a line was going to end—“Zeus, who marshals the clouds,” say—or could count on being able to insert a formulaic passage of several lines, he could devote his energies to what we might think of as the “creative” parts. (It is worth noting, however, that within an oral tradition, a poet’s canny manipulation of traditional formulas and scenes could itself be considered creative.) Parry bolstered his hypothesis by drawing parallels between Homer’s epics and the epic verse of contemporary Yugoslav bards whom he had studied, who adapted and improvised on traditional material in the way he believed the Homeric performers may well have done. Most contemporary classicists, it seems safe to say, accept Parry’s core theory about the oral tradition in which the Homeric epics evolved. The poems likely began as relatively short compositions by preliterate bards who drew on traditional material—legends about the Trojan War, folklore about stock figures (wily tricksters, man-eating ogres, sage old kings), myths about the various gods—to fashion their songs. With each performance, they might elaborate on earlier compositions, refining and adding, even as they continued to rely on and employ traditional diction, epithets, and stock phrases and scenes. (Passages in the poem where a given epithet fits the meter but doesn’t fit the occasion were, according to Parry, traces of the poems’ origins as oral performances) As successive generations of poet-performers kept adding new material to their own and their peers’ works, individual lays—Achilles’ quarrel with Agamemnon over the enslaved captive Briseis, say, or Odysseus’s encounter with the Cyclops—presumably began to coalesce into larger works with grander arcs and themes: the climactic struggles of the Trojan War and what they tell us about the nature of human striving and mortality, Odysseus’s return from the war after twenty years and what it tells us about time and identity, family and home. Eventually, these increasingly vast works were committed to writing, possibly by a gifted poet-editor who collated the various versions known to him and assembled them into something like their present form. Just when this happened is, typically, up for debate. One theory that was long prevalent—based, in part, on comments by ancient authors such as Cicero—was that the first definitive written texts of the epics were compiled in the late 500s BCE on the orders of the Athenian ruler Peisístratos, who was keen to institute a recitation of the epics as part of a grand civic festival known as the Panathenaia. (For some scholars, this explains why a minor character in the Odyssey is called Peisístratos: an ingratiating nod to the event’s sponsor.) Such festivals, along with religious occasions, funeral games, and Panhellenic gatherings such as the quadrennial athletic games, were important venues for public recitations of the epics as well as other works. These performances, quite different from the intimate recitals in the courts of kings and nobles that are depicted in the epics themselves, were a vital part of Greek cultural life from the Archaic period on. The men who performed the recitations were known as rhapsodes, a term likely derived from the Greek verb “to stitch together,” presumably because they would piece together the mythic and folkloric material they inherited, the lays and various episodes, the traditional lines and formulas, into their compositions. Ancient texts refer to a law enacted by a son of Peisístratos requiring that the epics be performed in their entirety at the Panathenaia, each work being divided into parts that were assigned to the rhapsodes by lot, with successive rhapsodes reciting the different sections in order. For this to happen, of course, there needed to be a fixed text. And yet, it is clear that numerous versions and variants continued to circulate and the poems continued to evolve. Starting in the early 200s BCE, the plethora of such variants in the collections of the Library of Alexandria convinced the scholars who worked there that it was imperative to create a definitive critical edition of the poems. The version they and their successors produced eventually became the basis of a standard edition, widely circulated throughout the classical world and eventually copied and recopied by hand over the next millennium and a half, until the invention of the printing press. The first printed edition of the Odyssey was published in 1488, in Florence. All this helps to explain why the existence of “Homer”—the blind bard who, people thought for centuries, single-handedly composed both the Iliad and the Odyssey—is now questioned. Today, the name has become a convenient way of referring to all the obscure processes by means of which a loose collection of legends about the Trojan War and its aftermath were transformed, over time, into the two great epics we have today: masterpieces of astonishing structural complexity and coherence, great dramatic power, and profound insight into the human condition. (I will use “Homer” in this way.) Indeed, whatever the controversies about the identity of the epics’ poet (or poets), whatever the debates about the date and manner of their composition, there has never been disagreement, either ancient or modern, about the importance of the two Homeric epics. Through two millennia of Greek civilization, they remained the twin foundations of Hellenic culture, from the Archaic Era through the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, twenty centuries later: an essential part of education, the inspiration or models for much if not most subsequent literary and dramatic works, revered as sources of insight into subjects from ethics to medical treatments, and enjoying the supreme status and exerting the pervasive influence on Western culture that we associate with the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, which the Homeric poems eventually joined as the foundations of European civilization. __________________________________ Reprinted with permission from The Odyssey by Homer and translated, with an Introduction and Notes by Daniel Mendelsohn, published by the University of Chicago Press.

Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—such as options or futures—that have not been settled. It’s a measure of market activity and liquidity. In this chart, the metric is Open Interest / Market Cap, which shows how much derivatives trading (through open interest) exists relative to the total size (market cap) of the asset or company. Here’s what this means in practice: • SPY at 180.1%: The open interest in SPY options is 180.1% of SPY’s market cap. That signals extremely high speculative or hedging activity. • MSTR at 78.2%: MicroStrategy has a high level of speculative interest relative to its market size—likely due to its Bitcoin exposure. • AAPL at 3.2%: Apple has a much lower level of open interest compared to its market cap, which suggests less leverage/speculation relative to its massive size. Why it matters: • High open interest ratios can suggest heavy speculative positioning or hedging. • Low ratios might indicate a more passive investor base or less speculative attention. Would you like a deeper breakdown on how to interpret this in trading or investing terms? . Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures, that have not yet been settled or closed.

Title: The Prompt: Microsoft Bets Big On Its AI Future

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt, Over the weekend, Meta released a cohort of new AI models called Llama 4, which it claimed perform better and more cost efficiently than OpenAI’s GPT4-o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 for tasks such as creative writing, coding and summarizing documents. One of these models, called Llama-4- Maverick, was benchmarked on the popular platform LM Arena, where people rate and compare AI models' answers. But what Meta benchmarked turned out to be different from the one it had publicly released to developers, TechCrunch reported. Instead, the social media giant benchmarked a more fine tuned version, several AI researchers noted on X and Meta mentioned in fine print in its own blog post. As a result, LM Arena said it is updating its policies for fair and "reproducible" model evaluations in the future. “Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” it posted on X. “As a result of that we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn’t occur in the future.” The fiasco has raised concerns about the company’s claims about its models’ performance being potentially misleading and points to the fact that these benchmarks aren’t always a reliable measure for AI’s capabilities. Now let’s get into the headlines. Last week, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 90 countries that shook the stock market. While those tariffs exclude semiconductors— the powerful chips that undergird AI models— they could make imports of essential materials like aluminium and structural steel more expensive and drive up the cost of building the massive data centers where AI models are trained, Forbes reported. “By the time we have developed the capacity to domestically produce these systems, we will have lost the AI race," Gavin Baker, chief investment officer at private equity firm Atreides Management said on X. AI might have also had a role to play in coming up with Trump’s trade policies, which resemble ChatGPT’s, Gemini’s and Grok’s breakdown of how the tariffs were calculated, Verge reported. The White House denied the claims and published what it said was its formula for the calculations. Shopify’s billionaire CEO Tobi Lutke said the e-commerce giant is changing its approach to hiring in the age of artificial intelligence. Teams will be required to demonstrate why AI can’t get the job done before asking for more resources and additional headcount, according to a memo sent to employees which Lutke posted on X. Shopify’s workers are also expected to use AI in their day-to-day jobs and their performance reviews will include questions about AI usage. New York City-based Runway, which develops AI models for video and image editing, raised $308 million. It’s now valued at over $3 billion, according to PitchBook and multiple reports. The company’s tools have been used to create scenes in Oscar-winning film Everything Everywhere All at Once. Runway’s AI software is used by tens of millions of users that include Hollywood filmmakers as well as budding artists, CEO Cristobal Valenzuela told me. The appeal? Runway’s easy to use tools. “You don't have to learn this complex 30-year-old software stack or creative tools that have been around for so long. You just can go from the idea to the final execution in a few minutes with Runway,” he says. A Microsoft sign is decorated in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary at Microsoft headquarters, Friday, April 4, 2025, in Redmond, Wash. (AP Photo/Jason Redmond) On Friday, Microsoft celebrated its 50th anniversary. The company behind the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office suite of applications like Word and Excel used the occasion to highlight its innovations in artificial intelligence, which ranges from its search engine Bing to coding tool GitHub copilot to its family of small-sized language models called Phi. It also announced new capabilities for Copilot, including in-depth research and the ability to carry out specific tasks on a person’s behalf. Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, a software which allows companies to build AI apps and what’s called “agents,” systems to carry out specific tech-related tasks, is used by some 60,000 customers, Microsoft announced. (The celebration was interrupted by employees who protested Microsoft allegedly selling its software and AI tools to the Israeli military. Microsoft terminated their employment, CNBC reported.) I spoke to Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for AI platform, Eric Boyd about how the company has evolved over the years. Boyd joined Microsoft in 2009 on the Bing team. Rashi Shrivastava: Is there a key moment in Microsoft’s history where you realized the significance of this technology and how it could change the way we work in the future? Eric Boyd: For me, it really crystallized when I saw probably GPT-3.5 and this was probably about six months before ChatGPT got released and we were just playing with it. But it hadn't really broken through to the mainstream. And I remember I was really almost frustrated at the time. I'm like, how come the whole company isn't taking a bet on AI and just refactoring, refocusing everything that they're doing. And then we saw GPT-4 a few months later and we did exactly that. Satya got all of the key leadership in the company into a room and said, ‘here we have this new technology and look at it, understand it, and he gave very specific instructions. I want you to come back with plans on how you're going to incorporate this in your products. We already have spellcheck–don't make spellcheck a little bit better. I want you to rethink the way that this is going to work in your products. Every team has plans and every team threw those plans out the window and came up with new plans for how they were going to refocus on this. And it was just an astounding pivot for the company that led to just this watershed where we realized things are going to be radically different. We're going to operate in a very different way. The world's going to be different as a result of that. Rashi: What is Microsoft's vision for AI in the future? Eric: Even if we kept doing just no new models, no new capabilities, no new functionality, there's at least five years of adoption to take advantage of the technology that we've already got. But we do have new things coming and I can ask a model to understand complicated things and do reasoning and give me answers back in a chat form. It’s going to change completely again as we move into a world where we expect these agents powered by models to go and do work for them and that I'm now going to be even more productive because I can assign sort of menial tasks. We now have AI that can do that mind numbing work really efficiently at massive scale and really well and just provide tremendous benefits to people. Rashi: Can we expect to see these agents in Microsoft products like Word and some of the other tools that we use in the future? Eric: I can't imagine that we wouldn't have that. I don't have anything to announce on that, but I definitely would expect that. Rashi: How has Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI evolved over the years? It seems like the company has been shifting away its reliance on OpenAI’s models to offer models from other companies like Mistral as well as build its own. Eric: “We have a really great partnership with Open AI and we continue to work really closely with them. I have literally 20 people in my team who are sitting at OpenAI's office each and every day working side by side with their engineers on the next things that we're looking to produce and move forward on. Our commitment to our customers is that we're going to give them the best frontier models produced by OpenAI along with the best models at each point at the price performance curve. I don't see that as a change really in our relationship with OpenAI. It's just making sure that we've got the full segment, all the segments in the market really covered. In some cases, AI’s medical decisions can be better than those of human doctors, according to a new study by digital health startup K and researchers at Cedars Sinai, Tel Aviv University. Forbes reported. The study, which reviewed 460 patent visits, found that K Health’s AI chatbot, which makes recommendations and diagnoses based on the patient’s medical records and conversations with the patient, matched the doctor’s decisions in two-thirds of cases and in the remaining one-third it offered better-quality care. A representative of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has moved through a string of federal agencies to reduce headcounts and slash budgets, appears to be trying to use an AI coding tool to write code for the Department of Veteran Affairs’ codebase, according to Wired. A DOGE hire called Sahil Lavingia, gained access to the department’s systems and is reportedly trying to digitize the organization with the introduction of AI tools for different uses.

Title: No proof Trump sold $2.3B in Truth Social stock before April 2 tariffs announcement

About this rating There was no evidence, such as mandatory public filings or credible news coverage, that U.S. President Donald Trump sold his Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) shares before his April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. However, on April 1, TMTG did reregister for sale shares belonging to Trump and several other shareholders, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At close of market on April 1, Trump's 114,750,000 shares would have been worth roughly $2.3 billion. Following U.S. President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement (archived) on April 2, 2025, a claim circulated online that Trump sold $2.3 billion worth of his Truth Social stock the day before he unveiled the tariffs. (Facebook user Cor Poll) The rumor circulated as a screenshot of a social media post and appeared on X (archived), Facebook (archived) and Instagram (archived). Text in the screenshot read: "Trump sold 2.3 billon worth of his truth social stock the day before he announced the tariffs. And other stock as well. His family did the same. What does that tell everyone?" Snopes readers also emailed us to ask about the claim. It was not possible to locate the source of the screenshot, but it appeared to be from a Facebook post due to the image that featured in the background. However, there is no evidence, such as mandatory public filings, that Trump sold his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, before the April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. A spokesperson for a company representing TMTG described the claim as "false" and no credible news media outlets had reported on the president selling his shares as of this writing. Therefore, we have rated this claim as false. The rumor appeared to develop following a TMTG filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 1, 2025, in which TMTG reregistered certain shares — including 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust — for sale. According to the SEC filing, Trump was the "settlor and sole beneficiary" of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. was the trustee. The filing, formally known as a Form S-3 Registration Statement, registered the shares for "possible sale" but left shareholders in control of when or whether to sell. Shannon Devine, a partner at MZ North America, an investor relations and corporate communications company representing TMTG, said via email that rumors the president had sold his shares were "false." "There has been no sale of President Trump's shares," Devine wrote. Trump has previously said he would not sell his shares in TMTG. If the sale was legitimate, it would have been eminently newsworthy. However, using multiple search engines, it was not possible to find any credible news reports that the sale had gone through. In a statement on April 2, 2025, TMTG called reports that it was "paving the way" for Trump to sell his shares a "fake story." The company said (link below ours): Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares. The SEC defined an affiliate as "a person, such as an executive officer, a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer." Devine confirmed that Trump was an affiliate of TMTG. Trump's status as an affiliate is important because affiliates are subject to tighter trading rules than non-affiliates. According to the SEC, an affiliate of a company must report via Form 144 any sale that "involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period." Had Trump sold 114,750,000 shares worth around $2.3 billion as online claims suggested, this sale would need to be reported using Form 144. The form has been publicly available through the SEC's EDGAR system since 2022. There was no Form 144 reflecting the alleged sale on TMTG's EDGAR page at the time of this writing (archived). TMTG filed its Form S-3 with the SEC on April 1. Companies in the U.S. must file a Form S-3 registration statement if they wish to raise capital after their initial Form S-1 filing. The Form S-3 registration statement offers "securities" — in this case shares — to the market, meaning it puts them up for sale. On April 2, news media outlets such as Axios, the Financial Times (FT), Business Insider and Reuters reported that the SEC filing would allow Trump to sell TMTG stock worth $2.3 billion, referring to the 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The SEC filing itself did not value Trump's TMTG stock. Rather, according to Axios, the $2.3 billion figure for Trump's shares came from the value of TMTG shares — listed on the Nasdaq composite index as DJT — at market close on April 1 of $20.26 per share. Business Insider used a slightly lower price of $19.19 per share at midday on April 1 for its calculations. Following the SEC filing on April 1 and the news reports above on April 2, DJT stock on Nasdaq dropped from $20.26 at close on April 1 to $17.09 at close on April 4. By comparison, the lowest closing price for DJT stock in April 2024 was $22.84 on April 16. (Nasdaq) On April 2 and 3, 2025, respectively, TMTG wrote to Axios and the FT. TMTG said the outlets' reporting had caused an "immediate" and "severe" drop in TMTG's stock price. TMTG further wrote that Axios and the Financial Times had misrepresented the S-3 filing as an intent to sell. In its message to Axios, TMTG wrote: Crucially, the article completely omits the critical fact, as is stated in the S-3 filing itself, that the filing consolidates prior registration statements in the form of an S-3. The Trust shares, in fact, had been registered previously—as Axios also could have discovered through a search of Google, the SEC EDGAR system, or its own reporting—and the S-3 filing did not cause or reflect a change in the status of those shares. The omission of this fact allowed Axios to misrepresent the S-3 filing as an indication of a new intention by the Trust to sell its TMTG shares. This false implication was re-reported widely throughout the media, causing an immediate, severe drop in TMTG's stock price. In its communication with the FT, TMTG said: Despite its supposed expertise in financial matters, Financial Times also failed to note that it is customary and expected—and beneficial to shareholders—for a U.S. public company to shift from S-1 to S-3 when it becomes eligible to do so. DJT was not the only large social media parent company to lose value in the days after "Liberation Day" on April 2. The stocks of Meta (Facebook and Instagram's parent company), Pinterest and Snap Inc. (photo messaging app Snapchat's parent company) all dropped between April 2 and April 7. Berkowitz, Ben.

Title: Who was hit the hardest? Billionaires lose out as stock market crashes

(Reuters: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool) Wealthy tech bros, former Playboy bunnies and Australian miners are turning on Donald Trump as the fallout continues from new tariffs he imposed on America’s trading partners late last week. The US president often says "tariff" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool. Business leaders who previously donated to Trump’s campaign or showed support for the US president during his re-election bid have criticised the widespread tariffs, which have plunged the global stock market into chaos. The tariffs were designed to deal with "the highest trade imbalances" with the United States and were wide-ranging measures taken in a bid to prioritise US manufacturing. However their sweeping nature has sparked fears of a global recession as investors sell off trillions of dollars' worth of stocks. Even with a two per cent rebound on Tuesday, Australian stocks had still lost more than five per cent - or over $100 billion - in value since last Wednesday's close. Meanwhile the world’s 500 richest people suffered the biggest two-day loss ever recorded on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, losing a collective $887 billion. Business men and women who have previously backed Mr Trump’s policies and election platform have since turned on him, with some suffering billions of dollars wiped off their overall net worth. Here's how much went missing One of Trump’s most famous advisers and the chief executive of Tesla has taken the biggest hit so far. Musk was already on a downward spiral following the boycotting of his products due to his close association with the president and his administration, but it was earlier this week that has dealt him his biggest blow yet. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index found Musk has lost $US31 billion ($51 billion) over the two-day drop, bringing his net worth to under $US300 billion for the first time since he ascended the rich list. However, the loss is not too damning for Musk – who remains clear of other billionaires to still retain his top spot as richest man in the world. Musk has not publicly reacted to the news of his losses, but he has lashed out at Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro over his defence of tariffs. He posted on X and said: “PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing”. Musk also later responded in agreement to a quote from economist Thomas Sowell: “In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it”. However, he has also shared content from the United States Trade Representative X account highlighting “unfair trade practices imposed on American exporters”. E-commerce giant and recently-turned media mogul Jeff Bezos has fared a little better than Musk across the two-day drop. The Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index found the Amazon founder had lost about $US24 billion to date. Bezos has likely lost out due to the major stock market sell-off that was triggered by escalating tariff tensions, and analysts say Amazon’s reliance on manufacturers in places like Taiwan and China could make it vulnerable in the trade war. He remains the second richest person in the world. The creator of Meta was a fixed presence throughout Trump’s campaign and joined forces with both Bezos and Musk to signal support from the technology sector. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, he lost about $US28 billion over the same period as Musk and Bezos. Like Bezos, Zuckerberg’s core business is heavily reliant on manufacturing in countries like India and China. It also relies on advertising revenue to survive, which could be impacted by any potential recession or economic slow-down. Zuckerberg has previously flagged his support for tariffs, expressing concerns European and Australian companies were unfairly targeting American tech companies with regulatory action. Just last month, he said the US government should be defending its own manufacturers and business owners against international penalties, however he has yet to comment on how the tariffs have impacted him personally. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has been the most outspoken about the impact of Mr Trump’s tariffs. He had a net worth of $US9.3 billion earlier this year, which has since fallen to $US8.8 billion — although the precise figure he lost during the market slump is not publicly available. Ackman took to X to criticise the implementation of the tariffs. "The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out," he wrote. “This is not what we voted for.” Ackman is the manager of Pershing Square Holdings. He said Mr Trump was risking an "economic nuclear war" and criticised his key advisers and their understanding of economics. "We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," he wrote. "What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?" Closer to home is the Hancock Prospecting billionaire. Rinehart is the richest person in Australia and supported Trump throughout his first presidency in 2016. She has pushed for similar policies in Australia around removing "red tape" and a US-style department of government efficiency. Rinehart's support of the US has continued through her buying up shares in Elon Musk’s Tesla and local oil and gas companies. Rinehart's net worth according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index is about $40 billion, but the Australian Financial Review said her fortune had dropped by $280 million since the market’s downturn. Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting sells a lot of its iron ore to major trading partner China, but she has yet to comment on the implementation of tariffs on the steel markets. Hendricks is one of Trump’s most prolific donors and her net worth is about $US20.9 billion. A former Playboy bunny, Hendricks made her fortune co-founding building products distributor ABC Supply Co, which is one of the country’s largest wholesale distributors of roofing, siding and windows. The nature of the business means tariffs will likely see the price of ABC’s products increase. Early estimations by Forbes found her company would likely lose about $US650 million as the market falls. While Ms Hendricks has not commented on the impact of tariffs personally, her company issued a statement to Newsweek about their potential impact back in March, before they were announced: “We understand that ongoing market conditions, including rising raw material costs and evolving tariffs, continue to create challenges in our industry,” the company stated on March 18. “This prior week, we have begun receiving price increase notifications from our suppliers. “As a result, ABC Supply will be adjusting pricing accordingly in line with the announced increases as they come into effect.” The pain isn't over anyone — for billionaires nor the less-affluent — although some economic analysts said the sliding stock market is losing steam. Australian shares closed higher on Tuesday, with the ASX 200 gaining 2.3 per cent and all sectors rising after the sessions of heavy selling. However the Dow Jones continues to struggle as Mr Trump doubled-down on his implementation of tariffs. "The long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place [sic]," he wrote on X.

A 10% tariff on all imported goods went into effect on April 5 and higher tariffs on specific countries (like China and Mexico) are scheduled to begin on April 9. While it’s unclear whether all the tariffs are here to stay, companies are already acting as if Trump will deliver on his threats in the long term. More of Apple’s iPhones, famously constructed from parts sourced all over the world, may soon be assembled in India to sidestep Chinese tariffs that could raise the hardware cost of the iPhone 16 Pro by $300 each. Nintendo is delaying pre-orders for the new Switch 2 in the U.S. while it games out-market conditions. It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years. Missing from the public conversation, in news articles and social media, are the direct voices of tech company leaders. This is in large part due to fears of attracting negative attention from the Trump administration. “CEOs with large global supply chains can’t be outspoken on this topic publicly because they need to cut deals,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, wrote on social media platform X. “But this is the tone of the convos happening right now,” he added, reposting pointedly negative comments about the tariffs from tech analyst Dan Ives. “If these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold, there is no debate … it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner,” Ives wrote. Ives continued, “In one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs … and slow down US tech innovation.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.

A hot potato: Global financial markets posted three consecutive days of losses as the trade war between the U.S. and the rest of the world escalated. The tech sector has been hit particularly hard by President Trump's tariffs, with all major U.S. tech companies losing a significant portion of their market value. Apple has seen the hardest hit, shedding nearly 20 percent of its market cap in one of the steepest declines in the company's history before a mild recovery on Tuesday. While most major American tech companies have much to lose in a global trade war, Apple – the world's largest by market cap – is the most vulnerable of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" due to its heavy reliance on China. Most of Apple's products, including its best-selling iPhone models, are manufactured in the communist nation, meaning the proposed 50 percent tariffs would affect it more severely than most. Related: Consumers race to Apple stores as tariff fears spark iPhone rush Apple also has manufacturing partners in Vietnam, Thailand, and India, but those countries are facing increased tariffs under Trump's new plan as well. Since Apple does not currently manufacture any of its products in the U.S., analysts believe that if the proposed tariffs are enacted, the company will either have to absorb the additional costs or raise prices – potentially reducing its profit margins or losing market share. According to UBS analysts, the tariffs could increase the price of the flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max by as much as $350 if Apple chooses to pass the cost on to consumers. Despite the downturn, tech stocks staged a mild rebound on Tuesday. Hopes that President Trump might delay or soften the proposed tariffs helped lift investor sentiment. Out of the big tech "Magnificent Seven" Nvidia led the recovery with a gain of about 4%, while Meta, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet rose around 1-3%. Source: Companies by Marketcap However, the broader picture remains shaky, underscoring ongoing concerns about the impact of a prolonged trade war. Last Thursday, rumors of a potential tariff delay triggered a volatile trading session, but not before the "Magnificent Seven" lost a staggering $1.8 trillion in market value in mere days. Apple's stock plummeted nearly 20 percent over the past three sessions, wiping out nearly $640 billion in market cap. The stock is up three percent in early Tuesday trading, but still down more than 16 percent over the last five days. Meanwhile, Brazilian media is speculating that Apple could shift iPhone production to Brazil to avoid the proposed tariffs on China. While Apple has not commented on these rumors, Brazil currently faces only a 10 percent tariff under the Trump administration's new plan – far less than India, which would be subject to a 26 percent tariff. Apple has been assembling products in Brazil in partnership with Foxconn since 2011. However, these facilities primarily serve the local market with entry-level models.

Wall Street’s main indexes have bounced back from a heavy selloff, led by technology stocks, on hopes of the US opening up for negotiations on its aggressive tariffs. Most megacap and growth stocks gained, with Nvidia and Meta Platforms adding 5 per cent each and Tesla rising 4 per cent. The technology sector rose 3.5 per cent, while indexes tracking banks and semiconductor stocks were up 4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively. The CBOE Volatility index – seen as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ – retreated to 38.59 points after rising on Monday to its highest level since August last year. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was trading 2.5 per cent higher after three sessions of heavy losses. “While today’s market bounce offers some relief, trade tensions remain the elephant in the room,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM. “With Trump threatening a further 50 per cent tariff on China and Beijing refusing to back down, sentiment could turn quickly.” At 9.35am eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.11 per cent; the S&P 500 gained 3.16 per cent; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.65 per cent. [ China vows to ‘fight to the end’ in tariff war with USOpens in new window ] Since the reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd, concerns over a global trade war and fears of a recession in the US have gripped Wall Street, with the three major indexes hitting around one-year lows. The Nasdaq confirmed a bear market on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow are down more than 15 per cent from their record-high closes. Uncertainty lingered after China said it will never accept the “blackmail nature” of the US to Trump’s threat to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview to CNBC on Tuesday tariff negotiations are the result of calls from other countries, not sliding financial markets, and China’s escalation is a big mistake. Meanwhile, Trump said he discussed tariffs, among others, in a “great” call with acting South Korean President Han Duck-soo. Worries that the aggressive US tariffs could spur inflation and hamper global growth have led to greater pricing of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Traders see more than 96 basis points of easing by the December, implying three fully priced in 25-bps cuts and a 84 per cent chance of a fourth such a reduction, according to LSEG data. A consumer price inflation reading is also due on Thursday, which could offer more clues on the inflation trajectory. Among individual stocks, chipmaker Broadcom advanced 7.4 per cent after the company said it was launching a new share buyback program of up to $10 billion. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group gained 7.6 per cent after the US announced 5.06 per cent increase in payment rates to private insurers for 2026 Medicare Advantage health plans. Humana soared 11.7 per cent, while Elevance Health also gained 6.5 per cent. CVS Health jumped 8.4 per cent. The insurer named UPS executive Brian Newman as its chief financial officer. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13.36-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 6.33-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded nine new highs and 24 new lows. Earlier, Asia stocks bounced off 1½ year lows, while European shares opened broadly higher. The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 1.4 per cent after falling for four consecutive sessions. The domestically focused midcap index also gained 2.5 per cent, after hitting its lowest point since November 2023 in the previous session. Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei stock index closed 6 per cent higher, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tasked with leading trade negotiations with Tokyo. – Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Good morning. Boomers told BI they are preparing for the worst as they worry about what cuts to the Social Security Administration could mean for their benefits and access to resources. "All I can do is cross my fingers and hope," one said. In today's big story, the markets briefly entered bear-market territory on Monday — a day that saw "fake news" trigger a $4 trillion swing in a matter of minutes. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was asked if he thinks a recession is coming. His response: We're in it. Tech: The market for face computers still isn't there — and could actually shrink this year. Business: One US sector could suffer big-time from Trump's punitive tariffs on Canada. But first, a near-miss for the markets. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A $4 trillion swing. An entry into bear-market territory. A new tariff threat. Yesterday was a wild day for Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell as much as 4.7% into the bear-market zone before briefly spiking on a tariff-suspension report the White House called "fake news." Roughly $4 trillion in market value was added to the index in 34 minutes because of the report. Then the "fake news" designation sent the market back down. The move demonstrated just how desperate investors were for relief from a relentless three-day stock rout. The S&P 500 ended the day above bear-market territory, but markets aren't out of the woods yet. The US and China could be heading for a long standoff in their trade war, risking collateral damage for economies and markets the world over, BI's Huileng Tan writes. On Monday, Trump hit China with a fresh threat of an additional 50% in tariffs — on top of a total 54% he announced since taking office — if Beijing doesn't withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it announced on Friday. Today, things intensified further. China's Commerce Ministry called Trump's latest threat "a mistake on top of a mistake." "If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end," said a ministry spokesperson. 1. Billionaires are turning on Trump over tariffs. The ultrawealthy were bullish on Trump around election season, but now they're souring on him after seeing trillions wiped from the stock market. They've seen their net worths plummet during the sell-off — and they've had enough. 2. Larry Fink says the recession might already be here. The BlackRock commander-in-chief said most CEOs in his orbit agree that we're "probably in a recession right now." But he doesn't think you should sell your stocks just yet. 3. Tesla's latest plunge has proved Trump's commerce secretary wrong. Last month, Howard Lutnick said a $235 share price was the lowest Tesla would ever go and that they'd "never be this cheap again." Shares on Monday dropped as low as $214. 1. The face-tech market just ain't happening. Big Tech companies like Apple and Meta keep betting on face computers like AR and VR goggles, even though customers don't seem to be interested. This year, the market for face tech might even shrink — but Meta's still optimistic. 2. A logistics giant is turning its warehouses into robot testing labs. GXO is betting big on the next frontier of physical AI, putting humanoid robots from three different firms to work in its warehouses. GXO's chief automation officer said the tech could theoretically complete multiple tasks in the future. 3. Trump tariffs are all about Taiwan. Tariffs are Trump's attempt to shift the global economy away from Chinese manufacturing. That's because Taiwan, home to TSMC, is at the heart of global supply chains. If China invades Taiwan, the economic shock could make last week look tame. 1. The next big loser in Trump's beef with Canada. Canadian investors have put some $184 billion in US commercial real estate over the last decade. Some are wealthy pension funds such as Oxford Properties Group, a partner in Hudson Yards. Trump's punitive tariffs are endangering the pipeline of steady Canadian cash to those projects. 2. The Okta CEO's hot take on the job market for software engineers. Even as AI shakes up the field, Todd McKinnon expects more demand for software engineers in the next five years, not less. Here's why. 3. DOGE's targets in its consultancy crackdown. From DEI to energy-related contracts, BI analyzed five government contracts DOGE has axed. It shows a major realignment in how the federal government is working with consultants.

The millions of people who rely on medical devices like hearing aids or insulin pumps could face higher prices due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Unlike pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers did not get a carveout from the levies. Some 40% of all devices are manufactured overseas, including in Mexico and Europe, which now face tariff rates of 25% and 20%, respectively. Even devices manufactured in the U.S. may require imported parts, which could be subject to tariffs. The CEO of one health system based near Seattle told Forbes its costs could go up $10 million to $25 million a year due to tariffs. “The healthcare supply chain is fragile,” says Erik Wexler, CEO of Providence.

All three indexes fell dramatically at opening, but then reversed course after an unsubstantiated claim circulated on social media saying the White House would pause the tariffs for 90 days before the Trump Administration called it “fake news.” Bitcoin’s post-election gains were briefly erased Monday, as the token is one of several that has declined in value in recent days after Trump’s tariff announcement. The tariffs have wiped about $290 billion from the global crypto market’s aggregate capitalization since April 2, despite Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. The tariff saga continues, as Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China, and the European Union is reportedly considering a 25% import tax on some U.S. goods. The White House already imposed one of the harshest levies on China, at 34%, on top of a 20% tariff imposed earlier this year, meaning the tax would climb to 104% under Trump’s latest threat.

Prenosil is worth an estimated $1 billion as shares of the sporting goods chain soared more than 850% over the past five years. The U.S. lags when it comes to privately financed infrastructure, but Michael Dorrell, CEO of infrastructure investment firm Stonepeak, has turned the market into a bonanza. Stonepeak manages a $72 billion infrastructure portfolio that includes wind farms, broadband service and fiber providers, and Forbes estimates Dorrell is now worth $8.5 billion.

President Donald Trump’s tariff policies threaten his gains from his social media venture: After announcing the plans last week, Trump’s stake in the parent company of Truth Social plummeted about $260 million to $1.9 billion. But Trump is still ahead, since he invested no money in the business at the outset, and it has a super-high valuation relative to its underlying financials. If you’ve looked at your retirement or brokerage account the last few days, it probably hurt. But the losses you’re seeing don’t translate for tax purposes unless you sold investments. To figure out the realized gain or loss, subtract the basis (how much you paid for an asset) from the sale price. ID Logistics French logistics company ID Logistics took a hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week, and its billionaire founder and CEO Eric Hémar lost $200 million. It’s no surprise given that ID is caught in the middle of the international showdown. ID—which manages the flow of goods in and out of warehouses for companies like Amazon and Inditex, packaging items before they’re shipped to consumers—is the leading logistics company in France, and also has a presence in 18 other countries. Approximately 70% of its $3.6 billion in revenue comes from outside of France, with the greatest share from Poland, followed by the U.S., then Spain and Portugal. But Hémar doesn’t appear to be rattled. When asked about the tariffs, he responded calmly. “My business is domestic,” he said, “Where I am directly concerned is that my business is sensitive to the economic climate.” But one analyst told Forbes that an economic downturn could encourage companies to outsource more of their logistics and drive more business to ID. The contract logistics industry barely existed a few decades ago, when most companies handled their own packaging and shipping. Now businesses are increasingly realizing they can save money by outsourcing those tasks. The industry is set to keep growing: BNP Paribas estimates that the contract logistics market in the U.S. is only 20% built out; the most mature market is the U.K., at just 60%. WHY IT MATTERS “Plenty of companies are already experiencing losses from Trump’s tariff war—but on the other side of this economic turmoil, there will also be some winners,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “One could be the French entrepreneur Eric Hémar, along with his company ID Logistics. His industry is set to expand if retailers, eager to find new ways to cut costs, start outsourcing more of their logistics.” MORE Despite Share Slide, Jeff Bezos And Amazon Look Likely To End Up Tariff Winners Analysts see turbulence ahead for the airline industry as tariffs weigh on consumer confidence.

Title: How Apple Stock Can Beat Trump's Tariffs

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SHANGHAI, CHINA - APRIL 7, 2025 - An flagship store of Apple Smart Products on Nanjing Road ... More Pedestrian Street in Shanghai, China on April 7, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Apple stock has fallen over 15% in the last two trading sessions after President Donald Trump announced a broad set of tariffs affecting more than 100 countries. These tariffs hit countries integral to Apple’s supply chain—namely China, Vietnam, and India. On the surface, this development appears to pose a serious challenge for Apple’s U.S. business. The iPhone—America’s top-selling device—and most other Apple products are manufactured overseas, making the company highly vulnerable to rising costs. In a worst-case scenario, Apple’s earnings could potentially decline by up to 30%. However, Apple likely has several ways to counter these effects, including price adjustments, stronger carrier collaborations, relocating production, and expanding its high-margin services segment. Also, learn how META might be impacted in META Stock To $200? What The Current Market Turmoil Means. Although it’s still uncertain how exactly these tariffs will be applied, here’s a rough worst-case scenario. Most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which is now subject to a 54% tariff. A Nikkei report from last year noted that the iPhone 16 Pro—expected to be the most popular model in the U.S.—costs Apple around $568 to produce. It retails for $1,000, providing an estimated gross margin of 43%. If tariffs raise the cost per device by over $300, the landed cost would increase to about $870, slashing the gross margin to just 13%. Apple’s Americas segment, which includes both North and Latin America, made up about 43% of total revenue last year. It’s reasonable to assume that the U.S. contributes between 25% and 30% of Apple’s total revenue. After excluding services revenue, which isn’t impacted by tariffs, roughly 20% to 25% of Apple’s income could face major margin pressure. Since other operating costs won’t drop alongside falling gross profits, the effect on net income and EPS could be even greater. A 25% to 30% hit to EPS is well within the realm of possibility. That said, Apple has several tools to help soften the blow. Raising iPhone Prices: Apple hasn’t changed the base price of its flagship iPhones in over seven years. The iPhone 16 Pro still retails for $1,000—identical to the iPhone X in 2017. Over that same period, the U.S. consumer price index has risen by about 29%. In light of this inflation, Apple could reasonably increase prices by $100 to $200 for the next iPhone without much customer pushback. Since U.S. pricing typically sets the tone globally, this could help improve margins worldwide. Partnering with Wireless Carriers: In recent years, U.S. wireless carriers have heavily subsidized iPhones to attract and retain users in an increasingly saturated market. Apple might collaborate with carriers to share the tariff burden, with carriers absorbing part of the price hike to stay competitive. Recent increases in wireless plan costs also give carriers more flexibility to offer better deals or financing options for iPhones. Increasing iPhone Production in Lower-Tariff Countries: At present, most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which now faces a steep 54% tariff. However, Apple has been scaling up production in India, which only incurs a 26% tariff. While India produced an estimated 14% of global iPhones last year, reports suggest Apple aims to raise that to 25% by 2025 and potentially up to 50% by 2027. Expediting this shift could help Apple protect its margins. Services Can Mitigate Impact: Apple’s services segment—not only its highest-margin division but also its fastest-growing—posted a 14% increase over the holiday quarter. In comparison, hardware only grew 1.5%. Services margins reached 75% in Q1 FY’25, compared to 39% for hardware. This segment has played a key role in lifting Apple’s overall margins, which climbed from 38% in FY’21 to 46% in Q1 FY’25. Continued expansion in services could help buffer the pressure on Apple’s U.S. hardware business. Apple stock may face continued pressure in the short term as more details unfold. The stakes are undeniably high. Amid economic uncertainty, ask yourself this: will you hold on to your Apple shares, or will you panic if the stock drops further? Holding onto a falling stock is never easy.

Title: Thanks to the Trump tariffs, Framework has paused US sales of some laptops

Framework recently announced that it is temporarily stopping the US sales of certain laptops, specifically the base Framework Laptop 13 (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). The company, in an X post, cited the new tariffs that President Trump imposed just days ago, on April 5. Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we’re temporarily pausing US sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). For now, these models will be removed from our US site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them. When questioned about why it was pausing sales in the US, the company claimed that it priced its laptops when the import tariffs on Taiwan were 0%. Now that there's a baseline 10% tariff on all foreign-origin goods, the company says, "we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss," adding that it is not alone in this decision, as other manufacturers have taken similar measures but aren't open about it. The "reciprocal" tariffs that Trump introduced have hit the tech industry very hard. Many tech companies were notably affected: Tesla's stock fell by 43%, Nvidia's by 30%, Apple's by 27%, Alphabet's by 23%, Amazon's by 21%, Microsoft's by 16%, and Meta Platforms' by 14%. Nintendo's launch of the Switch 2 console coincided with the introduction of tariffs ranging from 34% to 49% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, where Nintendo sources components. Since Nintendo did not account for the tariffs in its pricing, this caused the company to pause US pre-orders to assess the impact of the tariffs. Framework and Nintendo are not the only companies affected by the tariffs. You can check out our report on how, thanks to Trump, you could be paying more for your next Samsung device since the South Korean tech giant does not have an assembly line in the US. And for your next iPhone, you could also be paying as much as $2,300, with the price possibly shooting up to the $30K to $100K range if all the components were made in the US.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Title: India could be a key part of Apple's damage-control plan for tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-07T21:19:00Z

Apple’s (AAPL+4.60%) initial plan to take the edge off of President Donald Trump’s trade war includes sourcing more of its phones for the U.S. market from factories in India, according to the Wall Street Journal. Apple apparently sees this as a temporary measure to mitigate the blow from escalating tariffs; the company isn’t yet seeking to upend its entire supply chain over the news, according to the Journal’s unnamed sources. Apple’s stock has plunged about 17.5% since Tuesday, a day before the president blew up global trade norms by hiking taxes on nearly everything imported into the U.S. As part of the chaos, the U.S. announced 34% tariffs on China, and China responded likewise on Friday with 34% tariffs on the U.S. The stakes rose again Monday when Trump threatened an extra 50% tariff hike “if China does not withdraw” its aforementioned retaliatory tariffs. By comparison, the Trump administration slapped 26% tariffs on India last week. India’s government has indicated that it will not respond with retaliatory measures, per Bloomberg. Apple has long relied on factories in China to produce much of its iPhones, and as such, the company’s stock has fared worse lately than many of its Big Tech peers. While Meta (META-0.97%), for example, is indirectly vulnerable to tariffs through its impact on corporate advertising budgets, Apple’s entire business hinges on factories in countries with low wages and on parts sourced around the globe. Apple did not immediately respond when Quartz asked for details on its iPhone sourcing plans. Apple has shed 24.10% of its stock price in the past month, as analysts expect tariffs to substantially drive up iPhone price tags and ultimately undermine sales. UBS analysts, for example, think the tariffs could drive up the price of Apple’s costliest phone — the $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max — by $350, while the $999 iPhone 16 Pro could climb an additional $120.

Since Nov. 5, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has strengthened against the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of Nasdaq firms including top tech names like Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla. On Monday, one Bitcoin was worth around 1,993 shares of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which offers equal weight exposure to the group of tech firms. A year ago, one Bitcoin could’ve bought 1,756 of the exchange-traded fund’s shares, when it was worth $69,000. On Friday, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at asset manager VanEck, said the ratio had reached an all-time high on X, formerly known as Twitter. “[I’ve] been telling clients for years to use Bitcoin to hedge FAANG exposure,” he added, referring to a popular acronym for mega-cap tech stocks Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Bitcoin’s relative strength against Magnificent Seven stocks was at its highest level within the past year on Monday, rising 13.5% over the course of that period. Despite Bitcoin recently trading like a tech stock, some market participants viewed it as a sign of divergence. “In past market turmoil, Bitcoin has had a mixed track record of providing short-term protection,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “Is this the turning point when it starts to shine as a resilient short and long-term store of value?” As the president has pushed forward with his trade war, U.S. stocks have weathered their worst stretch since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell for a third straight day and has dropped 10% over the past week, per Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin’s price fell as low as $74,600 on Monday, setting a new low for Trump’s second term, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. While the S&P 500 has given up its post-election gains, Bitcoin is still changing hands above its Election Day price of $69,000 on Nov. 5. “Compared with historical macroeconomic shocks or crypto market cycles, these are not record-setting drawdowns,” Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, told Decrypt. “The asset class has weathered worse and, historically, emerged stronger each time.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

April 07, 2025 16:43 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.
