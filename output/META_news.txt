Photo / Michael Craig The New Zealand sharemarket rose slightly today after a strong lead-in from the US markets. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.05% or 6.553 points at 13,409.21 after 30.7 million shares worth $123 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.07%, closing at 7676.73 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,764.34 after rising 0.19%. There were 72 gainers on the main board and 59 decliners. Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said the market was treading water today. “The index did follow in kind with US markets hitting record highs. “The latter part of our session we came back somewhat,” Sullivan said. “Looking ahead we’ve got a big couple of days for earnings in the US, as well as the Fed, so that’s probably going to be the main macro story for the markets.” Five companies from the “Magnificent Seven” will report over the next day and a half, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. On the NZ sharemarket, NZME upgraded its financial forecasts and said its revenue was likely to be better than expected. The media company told the NZX this morning it expected operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for 2025 to be between $59m and $62m. That was up on earlier guidance of between $57m and $59m. “NZME is heavily reliant on ad spend and has done a bit of cost-cutting as well. There’s some positive momentum into FY26 for them, midpoint of their upgrade at 12% year on year,” Sullivan said. NZME’s share price rallied 6.67% or 7c to $1.12 after 900,674 shares changed hands on turnover worth $1m. Elsewhere, market minnow New Talisman Gold Mines’ share price rallied by 16.98% to $0.06 after the firm announced it had signed an agreement for the offtake of gold concentrate. However, the regulator swiftly applied a trading halt to the company after the update. “They said their announcement wasn’t price-sensitive, but their stock went up 17%. They said they were freezing it and were going to have a closer look at it. If the market thinks it’s price-sensitive, it probably should have been [treated as such].” Other movers today included Vista Group, which fell 3.91% or 11c to $2.70; A2 Milk, which rose 1.90% or 20c to $10.70; and Contact Energy, which fell 0.63% or 6c to $9.40. Sullivan said the lead-in from the US was interesting, particularly for the fact that it featured the widest ever divergence of companies on the S&P 500 in a positive day. “There were 102 that were positive, and 398 that were negative, and yet the market closed up. That’s the widest it’s ever been. Nvidia now makes up 8% of the S&P 500, the largest since General Motors in the 1970s. “Now when Nvidia moves, so does the market.” Wall Street stocks rose to fresh records again on Tuesday local time as a jump in artificial intelligence player Nvidia’s shares added to bullishness over easing trade tensions and market-friendly central bank policy. All three major US indices climbed to records for the third straight session, with Nvidia piling on about 5% as the chipmaker announced new ventures and chief executive Jensen Huang headlined a company event in Washington. Donald Trump is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea – and rosy comments by the US President have fuelled optimism that the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, can strike a deal to ease their trade war. – Additional reporting AFP Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.

This seven-day correction has put an end to one of the longest bull runs in the history of the precious metal. · With markets already factoring in another rate cut in December, traders are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to give them clues about the direction of monetary policy going forward. · Investors, however, kept an eye on developments on a possible trade deal between the US and China that would further reduce demand for safe havens. · A framework deal between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump is anticipated to be finalised. The pact aims to loosen China’s limitations on rare earth shipments and stop more US tariff rises. Technical Triggers · First target achieved in Gold at $3960 (~Rs 119,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to $3850 (~Rs 117,000). · First target achieved in Silver at $46 (~Rs 140,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to 45(~Rs 136,500). Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group As mutual fund houses resume investments in Silver ETFs, should investors consider taking a fresh entry? The lull in silver fund investments by mutual fund houses previously was spurred by supply inadequacies and high premiums on physical silver, now relaxed as global supply chains stabilize. Silver price has also corrected on its peak, creating a healthier entry point for long-term investors. Silver is unique because it can be utilized as a store of value, similar to gold, and it’s also a critical industrial metal that finds applications in semiconductors, electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles. In the future, the structural demand for silver is set to continue being robust in the face of the global energy transition, increasing renewable capacity, and technological advancement. But investors should keep in mind that silver as a commodity is still a volatile and cyclical asset, which tends to react sharply to changes in global interest rates, inflation expectations, and industrial demand changes. Rather than attempting timing of entries, investors need to invest systematically in order to average out volatility and sharp corrections. How much allocation to Silver ETFs (as a percentage of the overall portfolio) would be advisable for investors as these units become more accessible? The entrance of Silver ETFs, thanks to the fund offerings from various Indian AMCs, opened a new avenue for the investors to invest in silver more comfortably. Nonetheless, the investors’ commitment to having a varied portfolio is still vital, as the precious metal generally experiences more volatility and cycles than investments in stocks or bonds. A diversified portfolio is one where silver exposure of 5-10% through ETFs or mutual funds is usually recommended. Given the nature of silver prices being so volatile, it is wise to adhere to SIPs (systematic investment plans) instead of taking all at once. This approach works by outputting the costs of buying and also cutting down on the risk of poor timing. Moreover, it is also important for the investors to keep an eye on the trading of ETFs at premium or discount prices before they invest since these aspects can have a big influence on the returns. All in all, Silver is an investment category that is very much a part of the diversification and inflation-hedging worthiness. What strategy should existing Silver ETF investors adopt in the current market scenario? For investors already holding silver, staying patient is crucial in the current market. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain strong due to its steady structural demand. Silver surged to its historic highs in 2025 before correcting sharply, and while Indian ETF premiums have normalized post-Diwali, supply-demand tightness continues. Since silver’s growth story is still intact, investors should view their investments with a long-term holding perspective rather than responding to short-term corrections. With its widespread use in electronics, solar energy systems, batteries, and semiconductors, the metal is crucial to today’s technologically driven world. The technology evolution and the move to using renewable sources of energy keep the silver demand steady, thus reinforcing its long-term price trend. For investors, opting for a staggered investment strategy over gold/silver ETFs or mutual fund is an excellent way to cope with the volatility and possible corrections after such a steep rally, besides seizing the long-term trend. Silver ETFs have delivered strong returns so far. As geopolitical tensions ease and supply-demand concerns persist, what is the outlook for silver and silver-backed assets in the near term and long term? This year, silver has been a very profitable investment, which can be attributed to the strong demand from both industries and investors. Currently, both physical silver and ETFs are experiencing the same supply-demand pressure with demand being the reason for premium trade due to the limitations. Although the trading volumes may be reduced temporarily due to the calming of geopolitical tensions, the fundamentals of the metal are still very strong. Silver is still a key component in the green technologies area, which includes solar panels, EVs, and advanced electronics, so the industrial demand is constant. The prices of silver are backed by the structural demand which the global production cannot meet. The strong demand for this precious metal is a fact that is supported by the market speculations throughout the whole short-term period. Pullbacks in the price of silver should be considered to be the normal phases of a broader uptrend and not a ground for worry by the investors. India’s industrial growth slowed to 3% in H1FY26, but GST reforms, festive demand, and easing inflation may drive a rebound in the second half, says Bank of Baroda.

Cyclone Montha weakens into a Cyclonic Storm near Machilipatnam; APDMA warns of continued rain, gusty winds, and flooding risk across coastal Andhra. Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com Bitcoin fell back below $113,000 even as U.S. equities notched fresh records to underscore a widening gap between traditional and digital risk assets. A rotation into AI-heavy stocks after Nvidia’s 5% rise appeared to siphon liquidity from crypto and kept bids subdued. Despite recovering from the October 10–11 shock, resistance above $116,000 persists with limited follow-through from buyers. Analysts flag the short-term holder cost basis near $113.6k as a key pivot. Any failure to hold that level could extend the retracement toward sub-$108k. This would imply a deeper test of structural support. Macro dynamics remain in charge. Equity gains reflect optimism ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech results. The same liquidity rotation is but weighing on digital assets. A 25 bps US Fed cut is widely anticipated and market reaction will hinge less on the move itself and more on whether Chair Powell signals a pause to quantitative tightening. In the near term, rising Treasury yields and renewed flows into equities imply capital is clustering in safer or higher-performing sectors. This keeps crypto in consolidation rather than a full-blown recovery. Altcoins tracked Bitcoin lower. Ethereum slipped 3% to just under $4,000, while Solana and Litecoin fell nearly 3% to unwind much of their early-week gains. The debut of new spot ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin did little to lift sentiment as traders prioritised risk management over chasing catalysts. Sui (SUI) dropped 4% to $2.50 after a late-day breakdown, with ~2.7 million tokens reportedly changing hands in a single minute. The abrupt volume spike alongside a sharp price slide points to larger holders offloading into thin liquidity. This leaves the token vulnerable to further downside if follow-through buying does not emerge. Overall, the tape still looks like post-October digestion. It is strong enough to avoid decisive breakdowns but lacks the conviction to sustain rallies until macro clarity and fresh capital return.” Jefferies on Shree Cement Recommendation Buy; Target Price ₹33420, Earlier Target ₹35150 Miss on higher cost;

Given the sheer extent of the consultative paper and related documents, we are still in process of grasping the material to evaluate the likely impact. However, four key proposed regulations are noteworthy from a TER and AMC revenue standpoint. ▪ With an objective to rationalize cost for unitholder, additional expense of 5bps that was allowed in equity TER has been removed from the draft MF Regulations. PL View: This would be a negative for AMCs as 5bps would be directly reduced from equity TER ▪ To pass on any change in statutory levy in future, TER limits are revised downward to the extent of GST on all expenses other than MF fees. Hence, across slabs TER has been proposed to be reduced by 10bps PL View: While the wordings are a bit ambiguous this may mean that TER will have to exclude the GST impact which was roughly 10bps. Assuming that statutory levies would be permitted over and above the TER limit, this may not have a material adverse impact. ▪ To protect investor interest and ensure that expenses are charged only once, brokerage has been revised from 12 bps to 2 bps for cash transactions and 5 bps to 1 bps for derivative transactions. All other execution-related transaction costs may be charged on actual basis. PL View: As per SEBI, since AMCs already charge an MF fees, additional brokerage over and above 2bps would lead to a dual impact on customer. This would certainly be negative for brokers. ▪ A provision enabling TER to be charged based on performance has been introduced and same shall be voluntary for AMCs. A detailed framework in this regard shall be finalized separately in consultation with stakeholders. PL View: AMCs would be allowed to charge additional performance-based TER which would be a positive, increasing revenue; final guidelines are awaited. Sector/stock impact: We expect AMCs may pass on the 5bps equity TER cut to other industry participants however assuming no pass through, core earnings for ICICI Pru, HDFCAMC, NAM, ABSL AMC and UTIAM would be affected by 8.0-9.0%. The impact would be more severe for CRAMC at ~22% due to ~90% equity share. This negative effect has been partly neutralised by proposing a performance-based TER (framework to be finalised). Reduction of the cash brokerage from 12bps to 5bps and derivative brokerage from 2bps to 1bp would adversely affect brokers Gold stabilizes at $3,950 an ounce amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut after a three-day decline.

Title: AI monetization and capex in focus for Meta as Wall Street heads toward Q3 earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-q3-earnings-preview-ai-spending-monetization-capex-instagram-reels-2025-10
Time Published: 2025-10-28T17:56:13Z
Full Content:
Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's plan to spend more than ever on AI after the company announced earnings that were dragged down by a $15.9 billion tax charge. The social media giant and AI hyperscaler reported revenue of $51.24 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $49.5 billion. Earnings per share came in at $6.03, compared to estimates for $6.72. The stock fell more than 9% in after-hours trading. Meta said that its AI infrastructure spending will continue to rise, and that 2026 cap-ex will be "notably larger" than 2025. On a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that a "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing." In the "very worst case," he said, Meta will have pre-built capacity and will absorb the depreciation costs. Much of the call was spent discussing Meta's superintelligence lab — for which the company spent heavily to recruit talent — and its ability to monetize. Zuckerberg said that the lab's research enabled "new technological capabilities" that improved the company's products. Meta CFO Susan Li said that a number of "youth-related trials" slated for 2026 could also result in "a material loss." She also walked through the one-time $15.9 billion tax charge and said Meta expected its taxes to decrease in future years due to the Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q3 earnings call with analysts below: Zuckerberg closes out the call by saying that Meta is "seeing the returns" for AI in its core businesses, and that it gives the company "confidence" it should do more. "We want to make sure that we're not underinvesting," Zuckerberg says. Meta's stock is trading down around 8.5% as the analyst call concludes. "There's a lot of value to create with AI overall," Zuckerberg says. He says Nvidia has "extremely well-deserved success" in hardware, and that cloud partners are also finding lots of opportunity. AI app companies are "relatively small," he says, but there is a "huge opportunity." The technology industry has not seen this "rate of new capabilities," Zuckerberg says. New businesses can be built around these new capabilities, he adds. Zuckerberg says work on Meta's AI Ray-Ban and Oakley collaborations is going "very well" and will likely be a "very profitable investment" if strong sales continue. Some revenue will come from selling devices, and others will come from services on top of them, he says. The AI will become the "main thing" people are using the glasses for, Zuckerberg says. Meta CFO Susan Li says Advantage Plus ad tech improvements have led to a 14% lower cost-per-lead. Meta is working to broaden adoption of automated solutions, she adds. Advantage Plus is an "ongoing platform," she says. ARR for advertisers using automated options is $60 billion, and there's "room to continue growing that," she says. Zuckerberg says it's "valuable" that a lot of people use Meta's AI models, and that there's a clear correlation between model improvements and usage. He says that the Superintelligence Lab is the "highest talent density lab in the industry." The models will "improve monetization" by improving engagement and advertising, Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg says research will enable "new technological capabilities" that will be useful in a variety of products, from an AI assistant to a business AI to feed rankings. The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come.

The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come. "I think being best in a given area will drive great returns," he adds. Zuckerberg says Meta is trying to "build novel capabilities," and is not interested in any "check the box" exercises. Meta is working on a foundation model, but also advancing its inference models, Li says. Even "small-scale improvements" like small ad improvements grow revenue in a meaningful way, she says. Zuckerberg says that there was no specific timing for new models or products from the superintelligence team to be announced on the call, but that he was "excited to share more." Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta's ballooning infrastructure costs, saying the company is intentionally "front-loading" compute investments to stay ahead in the race toward superintelligence. He tells analysts that even if Meta overbuilds its data center capacity, the downside would be limited. In the "very worst case," he says, the company would have simply "pre-built for a couple of years," absorbing the costs through depreciation while eventually growing into the extra capacity. Zuckerberg argues that the greater risk is underinvesting, noting that Meta's AI research, recommendation systems, and potential external compute offerings could all profitably use far more compute than the company currently has. They "continue to see improvements in usage" of Meta's AI, Zuckerberg says. Once they have "truly frontier models with novel capabilities," there is great opportunity, Zuckerberg says. He predicts that the ability to plug in "leading models" will lead to a large amount of use. More intelligent models will also improve the core business, Zuckerberg adds. "There's quite a bit more to do," he says. While the stock had ticked up slightly to be trading around -7% mid-way through the call, it's dipped back down after hours. A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." Meta is trying to "plan ahead" to be able to meet necessary capacity in 2026, as well as 2027, and 2028, Li says. Their "foremost priority" is building the "compute that we need" to succeed in AI, Li says. There are "headwinds to the Quest headsets" since Meta does not have a new headset on the market this year, Li says. Meta is still expecting significant year-over-year growth in glasses in Q4, Li says. Li says that growth in CapEx is from all areas, including non-AI spend, but that AI needs are "growing the most." Li says that expenditures on ad ranking and performance efforts are paying off. There is "very strong year-over-year growth" in weighted conversions, she adds. Meta expects spending on AI talent to be one of its biggest cost drivers next year as it continues an aggressive hiring push. CFO Susan Li says employee compensation will be the company's second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026, largely reflecting a full year of pay for AI specialists hired throughout 2025 and new technical recruits in priority areas. She says the increased payroll comes alongside rising infrastructure costs, as Meta's compute needs have "continued to expand meaningfully" and the company plans to "invest aggressively" in both its own data centers and third-party cloud capacity. Li says that, depending on the results, they may result in "a material loss." Meta expects that infrastructure costs will expand, Li says. They expect "invest aggressively to meet these needs," Meta's CFO says. She says it will put "upward pressure" on CapEx. Li says that advertising revenue will drive growth, partially offset by Reality Labs introducing new Quest devices. Meta lifted its CapEx outlook. Investments in ads and "organic engagement initiatives" will enable "strong revenue growth," Li says. The staged data centers will allow Meta to build capacity quickly in future years "as we need it," Li says. Meta continues to observe "performance improvements" as it combines ad models, Li says. Meta is also piloting a new runtime ads ranking model, she says. It has driven a more than 2% lift in Instagram conversions, she says. Meta has more generative AI features for advertisers, Li says, including AI-generated music. These tools "drive increased performance," she says. Li says that global time spent was up on both Facebook and Instagram in the US thanks to video. Meta is developing foundational ranking models to yield more relevant recommendations, Li says. Users have created 20 billion images with Meta AI products, Li says. Since creating the Vibes AI feed, media creation on the Meta AI app has increased tenfold. Meta's headcount as of September 30 was 78,450, representing an 8% year-over-year increase. The CFO says that Meta was hiring in areas like monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and Superintelligence. The headcount metric included in Meta's before the recent superintelligence unit layoffs. Advertising demand has increased, Li says. Average price-per-ad was up 10% year-over-year. Reality Labs revenue was up thanks to retailers stocking up on Quest headsets before the holiday season, she says. While Meta paid a one-time $15.9 billion tax charge, Li adds that the company expects its taxes to go down due to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta's Ray-Ban Connects sold out in "almost every store" within 48 hours, Zuckerberg says. Demo slots are fully booked up through the end of next month, he adds. Zuckerberg says that Meta will invest more in the area. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says artificial intelligence is already boosting engagement — and profits — across the company's apps. In his opening remarks, he says AI-powered recommendation systems have led to 5% more time spent on Facebook, and 3-10% more time on Threads, with video viewing on Instagram up more than 30% over the past year. "Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion," Zuckerberg added. He said Meta's "three giant transformers" — AI models powering Facebook, Instagram, and ads — are increasingly driving how people discover content and how advertisers reach them. "Retention is looking good" for Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, Zuckerberg says. Usage is growing week over week, and it is an example of a new type of content, he adds. Zuckerberg says that there have been two eras of social media: content from friends and family, and content from creators. The next "corpus" of content will be from AI, he says. That will make recommendation systems valuable. The ARR for Meta's AI-powered ad tools has hit $60 billion. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. The Meta CEO also says that they are building an "industry-leading" amount of compute. He adds that he wanted to "aggressively frontload" building capacity for superintelligence. In the worst case, he says, Meta can "slow" building infrastructure. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Suan Li are on the call. They'll begin by reading through their prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts in a live Q&A. Meta said it expects to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on infrastructure this year as it builds out the computing power behind its AI ambitions, slightly higher than the $66 billion to $72 billion range it projected last quarter. The company said its demand for computing capacity has "expanded meaningfully," prompting bigger investments in data centers and cloud services. Meta added that its infrastructure spending will keep rising next year, with capital expenditure growth in 2026 expected to be "notably larger" than in 2025. Meta paid a one-time tax charge of $15.93 billion this quarter. The company expected a "significant reduction" in federal cash tax payments thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July. The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.

The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Otherwise, Meta says: Meta's Reality Labs revenue was $470 million with an operating loss of $4.432 billion for the quarter. The division houses Meta's AI consumer hardware, virtual reality gear, and metaverse spending, among other things. That includes Meta's Ray-Ban Displays, which the company announced in September. Reality Lab's losses are shrinking, albeit slightly, with the company losing $4.53 billion last quarter. Third Quarter Results Source: Bloomberg Forrester VP and Research Director Mike Proulx told Business Insider that Meta's third quarter was "flooded with feature updates, device announcements, and operational moves," with AI as the common thread. "Of particular note is the launch of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which effectively launched a new computing platform," Proulx said. "During the earnings call, I'll be listening for an update on sales. I suspect these glasses will mostly attract early tech-curious adopters, and that demos will far outpace actual purchases." He added that Reels' prominence on Instagram continues to grow as the app edges closer to TikTok, and that advertisers are unlikely to pull back spending despite Meta losing brand-safety accreditation from the Media Rating Council, given the platform's reach and performance. Meta has quietly assembled one of the most expensive AI teams in Silicon Valley under its Meta Superintelligence Labs division, hiring top researchers from DeepMind and OpenAI and spending billions on infrastructure. Yet the elite unit responsible for building next-generation AI models — literally named TBD — remains a black box. Investors will be listening closely for any clues from Zuckerberg on what, exactly, it's building. In September, the company debuted its new Ray-Ban Displays at the Connect conference. The glasses come with a built-in screen that displays text messages, maps, and captions over the real world. The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store."

The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store." Expect further questions on the analyst call about the sales mix between the screen-free Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses and the more expensive Ray-Ban Displays. In September, Meta released its new short-form AI video feed, Vibes. Some tech founders and execs quickly roasted it as "AI slop." Days later, OpenAI released its new video generation model, Sora 2. Its own short-form Sora app quickly topped the App Store charts. OpenAI has said that 1 million people downloaded the Sora app within five days, while Similarweb data indicates that the Meta AI app's downloads surged by 100,000 after the Vibes feed launched. We might get some further data points on Vibes engagement among Meta's users on the earnings call. Meta has faced some dramatic changes to its headcount in the past few months. After doling out big contracts to staff up its superintelligence unit, Meta cut 600 jobs from it. Meta also cut staff in its risk division as the company automated its review process, per a memo viewed by Business Insider. These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers."

These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers." It'll be interesting to see if Zuckerberg or CFO Susan Li talks about plans for future head count growth — or if they anticipate head count to remain flat or decrease in the coming quarters. When Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2021, Zuckerberg declared a "very long-term bet" on the metaverse. The company then spent billions on projects like Horizon. The fervor has since quieted, though the company announced a new AI feature to build 3D worlds with text at its September Meta Connect event. On Monday, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees the company was reshuffling its metaverse unit in a memo viewed by Business Insider. "The priority of the metaverse work remains unchanged, and it continues to be a companywide priority," he wrote. Mark Zuckerberg said Meta could spend up to $72 billion this year on AI infrastructure. Will Zuck raise that number even higher? It's possible, but if all this AI capex spend is really hurting Meta's free cash flow and margins, investors might start feeling uneasy. That's why they'll be laser-focused on Meta's advertising business, which still makes up most of the company's earnings. If ad numbers are healthy — and right now, expectations from Wall Street are high — then Zuck probably has more runway for his AI bets. Tech analysts at DA Davidson wrote ahead of Meta's earnings that they're watching for how Meta does compared to its Magnificent Seven peer Alphabet, which also reports results on Wednesday. "We expect META to continue outgrowing Google's ad revenue, though growth may decelerate on tougher comps (including elections)," the firm said in a client note. "We do not expect growth at Google to decelerate significantly, though we are monitoring OpenAI closely, as we believe the likely introduction of advertising around ChatGPT may create a headwind for Google Search advertising growth."

CFRA rates the stock a "Buy" and has an $880 price target for the stock, representing potential upside of 16%. JPMorgan's Doug Annuth wrote that he's bullish on the social media company's AI push ahead of earnings. After a big round of layoffs in Meta's AI unit, there's a lot of anticipation for updates on the superintelligence strategy. "We're bullish on AI Ad improvements, Reels, & Video. META continues to execute well across its AI strategy & push toward personal superintelligence prioritizing ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, & AI Devices."

The bank continued: "Meta should compare well, we expect 23% y/y growth vs 13% for Google properties in 3Q, with Meta possibly accelerating on AI driven improvements in targeting, deeper CRM integrations, video model unification & growing advertiser adoption of Gen-AI-powered creative tools." The bank has a $900 price target on Meta stock, a 19% increase from current levels. THIRD QUARTER Source: Bloomberg Jump to

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/28/what-caused-constellation-energy-stock-to-surge-by-80/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:16:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.

Title: The stock market is staring down a chaotic mix of its 4 most important catalysts this week

Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In the market, entire weeks can pass without any real catalyst. Inspiration can run thin, which can lead to traders talking themselves into tepid moves based on minimal information. This is definitely not one of those weeks. In fact, every single one of the four main narratives is in play concurrently, setting up an unpredictable period of trading. After all, the market is not a kung-fu movie, dispatching developments in orderly fashion, one at a time. It's more like John Wick, with complications constantly coming from all angles, often multiple at once. Let's recap the landscape, and how each driver could shape markets in the near term: Catalyst 1: The Fed The next FOMC meeting kicks off today, with the culmination on Wednesday, when the central bank announces its latest interest-rate decision. The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. What could happen: A single rate cut is priced in with 98% certainty, so any volatility will result from Powell's comments. If he laments that inflation is peskily high, that could dent rate-cut hopes and send stocks lower. But if he complains about any other struggling economic force — like the labor market — that could stoke expectations of more aggressive cuts, giving stocks a boost. Catalyst 2: AI fever The latest big development in this space came on Monday as Qualcomm threw its hat in the ring by announcing new chips and computers. This sent the company's stock surging (see below) and lifted chip names overall. Another week, another shuffling of major AI players — and this time OpenAI wasn't even involved. What could happen: Even if the Qualcomm-adjacent stock moves are limited to a single day, the company's announcement further raises investor antennae for new products and cross-company collaborations — all of which have been rocket fuel for associated stocks. Catalyst 3: Earnings season This week is as big as it gets. Across Wednesday and Thursday, the following mega-cap tech giants report: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. That's 25% of the S&P 500 right there. What could happen: At risk of stating the obvious, strong results should lead to stock gains. The question then becomes: what constitutes "strong"? For this group, which is enmeshed in the AI race, strength can be defined in a couple ways, namely: (1) better-than-expected future earnings forecasts and (2) tangible results of massive AI spending. Catalyst 4: Trade progress This is last chronologically, but certainly not least, since a reported US-China treaty was the main source of record highs for stocks on Monday. The main event comes on Thursday, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet. What could happen: Looking at the index level, trade-war progress is unabashedly positive. Fewer tariffs and more global collaboration is a good thing, especially for US exporters. At the sector and single-stock level, it's a bit more unpredictable, although there has been an unwinding of trades that benefited from US-China gridlock. For instance, safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys gave up some gains on Monday, while US-affiliated rare-mineral stocks took a tumble. Expect this to continue if further progress is solidified. Let's play a game: Can you tell the exact moment that Qualcomm announced its new lineup of semiconductor chips, with the intention of challenging Nvidia? All kidding aside, this was a momentous moment not just for the share price, but for the whole AI race broadly. While Qualcomm is a comparatively late entrant to the battle for AI supremacy, the company argues that its existing mobile technology will differentiate its chips. The market certainly seemed to agree, lifting shares 11% on the day, up 22% at intraday highs. Interestingly, Nvidia didn't take a dive on the increased competition, and was instead pulled higher alongside other chipmaker stocks. Even when someone comes at the king, the king still wins. Today's chart comes from Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo. It shows that the US currently has more data centers built than all other major countries combined. It has 5,425, more than 10 times Germany, which is in a distant second place. "The bottom line is that the rest of the world is far behind the US when it comes to AI," Slok wrote. Be sure to browse Business Insider's interactive map, which shows where data centers are all across the US. And check out the full investigation here. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. There's been plenty of recent chatter — and debate — about a potential AI bubble. Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, is leaning into the "not a bubble" narrative. He says the next few months are actually a good time to buy mega-cap tech stocks leading the AI trade, and he offers three main reasons why. The first is earnings, with Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple scheduled to report this week. "They should all be good because we came into the earnings season with estimates brought down a bit," Roberts told BI about the bevy of tech stocks reporting. Second is buybacks, which have historically been a way for companies to engineer stock gains and signal to investors that they think their stock is affordable. Repurchases are up 16% year-over-year, and companies that do them have been rewarded, Goldman Sachs data shows. "We're going to have about $6 to $7 billion a day in corporate buybacks starting in early November," Roberts said. "That's going to provide an uplift." Third, he points out that discretionary traders from institutions like hedge funds are underweight tech stocks at the moment. Roberts thinks their re-entry can fuel a rebound. "There's going to be a catch-up run, particularly in AI, as we approach the year-end reporting period," he said. For investors looking to follow his advice, funds like the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) offer exposure to mega-cap tech names. We're maintaining the First Trade index, an equal-weighted basket of five stocks that will be adjusted each week. After one rebalancing, we ended up with this group: Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Tesla. Each week, you'll vote one stock out, and one in. Last week we added Tesla, and this week we'll be sliding in Nvidia. It doesn't have earnings this week, but it's wildly popular with retail traders and has been absolutely scorching for the past few years. Its inclusion will come at the expense of J&J, which will be removed. And with that, our portfolio has gotten even more tech-heavy, and more levered towards the AI theme that's ruled markets. How will it work out? Check back next Monday, Nov. 3, for an update. The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: Here’s What Trump’s Ballroom Donors Want
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
The cost of Donald Trump’s garish ballroom that’s replacing the East Wing of the White House keeps increasing, from $200 million to $300 million and now $350 million in a matter of days. That’s because the cost of construction isn’t nearly as important as having an inventory of donations available for corporate America to pony up. These contributions—or if you prefer, bribes—work in two directions. One, they represent cash that companies can give to secure favors from the government. Two, they serve as a disciplining function from Trump: People giving to his ballroom can’t easily speak out against his abuses of power. It’s no real surprise that the formal editorial page of The Washington Post offered a limp defense of the ballroom, when the company founded by the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the donors. The White House has said it would allow ballroom donors to remain anonymous, but they’re the ones who put out all the names of the donors. The double game of bribery and disciplining only works if the names are public, and it certainly wouldn’t do for Trump to pay for his own ballroom out of a $230 million extortion from the Justice Department; that wouldn’t leave any room to demand tribute from the corporate sector. More from David Dayen The result is among the most corrupt displays in American history, with a president agreeing to do corporations’ bidding in exchange for financing a personal shrine and staying aligned for the duration of his presidency. We’ve seen other instances of personal self-aggrandizement and favor-trading, from pardoning convicted felons who partner with his crypto company to handing out contracts to businesses linked to his family to letting personal friends and patrons fund the Defense Department. (That’s all just in the last week!) But the ballroom is literally being built on a foundation of corruption, as a monument to it, on the very grounds of the White House. Which raises the question: What do all these companies in on the ground floor, so to speak, really want? Most of the companies that officially donated to the Trump ballroom have been in the Prospect’s crosshairs for some time, and in going back through our archives we can divine why they’re debasing themselves to play this corrupt game. Here’s a rundown: The first thing that jumps off the page is that the nation’s five largest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft—are all on the donor list. Google’s money comes from a settlement with Trump for taking him off YouTube after January 6th. Even before this, Trump had been the tech industry’s personal lobbyist abroad, shaking down foreign nations to drop their taxes and regulations on U.S. tech firms in trade deals. Trump’s attorney general was an Amazon lobbyist. And he exempted Apple from tariffs after getting a ridiculous statue from CEO Tim Cook. So why are these firms giving cash to someone who already is serving them well? That’s simple: ongoing maintenance. Google has been found liable for being a monopoly on multiple occasions in Justice Department cases; there’s an imminent ruling on its advertising technology business after Obama-appointed judge Amit Mehta delivered a light remedy on Google’s search monopoly. Meta recently wrapped up a trial in a monopolization case against the Federal Trade Commission, and a ruling is expected shortly; Apple and Amazon face monopolization lawsuits against the government as well, and Apple has lost private antitrust litigation. All of these cases could be withdrawn or settled by the president. In addition, all of these companies are spending fantastic sums in the global AI race. They need a government that will weaken state regulations and allow data centers to be built nationwide, as well as being willing to provide a backstop if the AI stock bubble collapses. (NextEra Energy, which is also a donor, is resurrecting an Iowa nuclear facility to power a Google data center; it will help to have the government in its corner.) There’s evidence that Meta’s appeasement of the Chinese government actually facilitated that country’s AI developments; Apple is exposed on aiding Chinese tech’s superpower status as well. Buying Trump’s loyalty helps him overlook these betrayals. Finally, Amazon is in the midst of trying to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional, and wants to keep the Trump administration out of that fight. Like with Big Tech, the crypto industry has already made its purchase of the inner sanctums of the government. Trump is literally a crypto mogul; his administration is allowing crypto in 401(k) plans and potentially as collateral for mortgages; nearly all of the overlapping civil and criminal investigations against crypto companies have been withdrawn; and Congress passed a stablecoin law that eases up on regulation and could facilitate private currencies. It is party time in the crypto world. Among the ballroom donors are Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether. Among individual donors are the Winklevoss twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, and Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also a donor; he made his fortune running Cantor Fitzgerald, which was the banker for Tether. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Again, this is about ongoing maintenance and future results. Coinbase and Ripple have been among the largest crypto spenders in politics since the 2024 elections. The Winklevoss twins recently interceded to get Trump to change his choice to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which the industry wants to become the lead digital assets regulator. But they need market structure legislation to make that happen, and Congress is in turmoil. Spending on the ballroom could be a way to go back to Trump and get him to pressure his Republican underlings to pass what the industry wants. Crypto titans also want the barely-alive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make it easier for customers to move their money out of banks and to their apps; that requires more quid pro quo relationships with D.C. power brokers. It may have been jarring to see printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard on the list. It’s a pretty Democratic firm in terms of campaign spending. But one of its business lines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, has been in the news lately. HPE successfully got a merger approved with Juniper Networks that the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division initially challenged. It turned out that HPE paid MAGA lobbyists to get top DOJ officials to overrule the Antitrust Division, in what ousted Antitrust Division officials later described as rank pay-to-play corruption. There’s likely to be a forthcoming judicial proceeding about the merger, which could reveal some very unseemly things about HPE. They’re likely paying Trump to try to keep a lid on this scandal. In addition, HPE’s dominance in enterprise networks could see them soar in the data center building boom, so keeping Trump happy makes sense there as well. Separately, Blackstone, the private equity firm run by ballroom donor Stephen Schwarzman, just announced an $18.3 billion deal alongside TPG to take mammogram rollup Hologic private, which presumably Schwarzman wants the government to approve. One decidedly old-school donor on the list was Union Pacific. But in July, the company announced a historic $85 billion proposed merger with Norfolk Southern, which would for the first time in American history put one company in control of a railroad that can travel coast-to-coast. Even Jay Gould couldn’t get a single transcontinental railroad done during the first Gilded Age. But Union Pacific’s dream would touch 43 states, and end the gentlemen’s agreement whereby two Eastern and two Western railroads split up the country. That merger needs to be approved … by the Trump administration’s Surface Transportation Board. So you get the picture here. Throwing down millions of dollars for a ballroom is a small price to pay for monopolizing freight rail commerce. One old-school member of the military-industrial complex showed up on the list, as did one new-school member. Lockheed Martin is in line for at least some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new contracts available after Congress topped up military spending in the Big Beautiful Bill. Palantir thinks it can get a substantial share of that money as part of the defense tech push, as well as funding for surveillance operations at the border. Meanwhile, national-security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton gave to the ballroom, an indicator of the continuing drift of rule by contractor in the Trump era. Sharp-eyed Prospect readers were sure to notice the presence of José and Emilia Fanjul on the list. The Fanjul dynasty, as we reported last month, has been a dominant fixture in American life since the 19th century, cleaning up in the sugar industry with favorable rules and tariff structures and the like. When Trump secured a deal with Coca-Cola to produce their soft drink with cane sugar, he was enriching the Fanjuls. And keeping sugar flowing from their plantation in the Dominican Republic that employs something approaching forced labor, which Trump secured with a quiet regulatory change this year, is a top priority. There are a few individual donors who are closely associated with the companies they run. Stephen Schwarzman and Blackstone have tons of business before the federal government, from housing to AI, and Pam Bondi was also that company’s lobbyist. The Adelson family has essentially dictated Trumpian policy in the Middle East. Fracking mogul Harold Hamm is a close associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and helped map out the administration’s energy policy. A little extra for the ballroom helps keep that on the right path. It was interesting to see cigarette manufacturers Altria and R.J. Reynolds International on the list. Cigarette companies’ stocks did fall when Trump’s Food and Drug Administration kept e-cigarettes on shelves in July. Altria once had a significant investment in Juul, the top e-cigarette maker, but divested in 2023. So maybe this is just a pitch for Big Sin to get back in the game with the administration. Less puzzling is the role of Caterpillar, the farm machinery manufacturer. Trouble in the agricultural sector is a direct threat to Caterpillar’s bottom line; a little investment in Trumpian relations to get better outcomes than a farm bailout (whereby farmers are paid not to produce, and therefore not use Caterpillar equipment) is in order. Caterpillar also has a big plant in Mexico that has been alleged to have committed significant labor violations; maybe this is buying off Trump to look the other way at an America Last company. Finally, your guess is as good as mine as to why Hard Rock International appears here. Maybe Trump has an old friend at Hard Rock from his casino days; or maybe Hard Rock wants the concession contract, or a few slot machines in the gilt-edged foyer. But there’s one more option; Hard Rock is among the firms trying to win a New York City license to install a casino in one of the five boroughs. Trump doesn’t have much clout in New York, but I guess every bit of leverage helps, should Trump decide to trade funding for a rail tunnel for a casino license for his favorite pals.

Stocks rallied to more records Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events. The S&P 500 rose 83.47 points, or 1.2%, to 6,875.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.47 points, or 0.7%, to 47,544.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 432.59 points, or 1.9%, to 23,637.46. Stocks also climbed to strong gains in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the leaders of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, the AP reports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's "a framework" for President Trump and Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, "We feel good" about working things out with China. Keurig Dr Pepper climbed 7.6% Monday after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. The company behind Canada Dry and Green Mountain coffee said it benefited from higher prices for K-Cup products, among other things. Some of Wall Street's most influential stocks are set to report their results this week, including Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. They'll need to deliver big growth and justify big spending underway in artificial-intelligence technology.

Qualcomm stock just soared 19% — its biggest jump in over a year. The reason? Qualcomm announced new AI accelerator chips, the AI200 and AI250, built to rival Nvidia and AMD in powering AI data centers. With a $182 billion market cap and entry into a $6.7 trillion AI infrastructure boom, Qualcomm is no longer just a smartphone chipmaker — it’s going all-in on energy-efficient AI hardware that could redefine the next era of AI computing. Analysts broadly see Qualcomm's stock as a moderate buy with significant upside potential.

The rapid rise of the fintech sector in India has enabled Indian investors to explore investment opportunities overseas, especially in booming markets like the United States. Global equities have become more accessible for Indian investors due to the proliferation of Portfolio Management Services (PMS), global trading platforms and fintech apps. As the US stocks have reached record highs in the last few days, it could be an opportune time for Indian investors to gain from the booming US market. Indian investors can explore a wide range of options from stocks of top global tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta to popular ETFs and index funds. The key US stock indices reached record high levels on Friday, after the potential China trade deal progress and anticipation of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow closed above 47,000 for the first time on Friday after September’s Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation had heated up but less than expected, as per a CNN report. Key indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, also rallied to new record highs on Oct. 24. The S&P 500 Index rose by 0.79% while the Dow Jones Industrials Index rallied1.01%.

Title: Exit dialogue: What would you consider a decent severance pay?

She rolled her eyes. Pay discussions are sensitive, but easier when you do it before joining, hence I ignored her non-friendly body language and pursued, “I mean, if you terminate me in the first year, will there be a special severance pay?” That conversation went on for another 45 minutes without leading to any conclusion, and she then had to pass it on to her CEO for a resolution. Are you wondering why I was spoiling my chances of being employed as a CEO? I had my reasons — the risk factors were big. The enterprise in question had the dubious distinction of asking two people before me to leave in the first year of appointment; and, if anointed, I would have been their fifth leader in seven years. I had asked for a year’s compensation if my employment contract were to be ended by the organisation in the first year. They didn’t have a formal retrenchment policy and were hence hesitant. Well, that was more than 15 years ago; today, most progressive organisations have a formal retrenchment policy, and the formulas are fixed. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), several countries offer some sort of a redundancy pay. The ILO’s Employment Protection Legislation (EPLex) database covers 116 countries, and lists the severance pay in months, based on tenure. Guess where India features in this? You will be surprised to note that India, along with countries like Japan, is at the top of the list, recommending 20 months of severance pay for employees serving 20 years. However, countries like the US, which dish out attractive severances to their ousted CEOs, recommend nothing, as per the ILO database. In a way, for every year of service, one month of severance pay is considered acceptable. According to the website TrueUp, which tracks tech layoffs, May and July saw the most number of layoffs — 24,000 and 46,000, respectively. It says the layoffs at tech companies have impacted 158,993 people so far in 2025. That’s about 541 people per day. Sounds like a lot? But then, if you compare with 2024, it was about 653 per day. All of us criticise enterprises that lay off people. But does it affect their brand worth? We know Wall Street rewards headcount reduction and even CEO firings. Remember, the stock price of Starbucks went up by 20 per cent when it replaced the last CEO. Let’s name the 10 brands that laid off employees in 2025 and ask ourselves whether we would be willing to recommend our near and dear ones to work there in the future? According to the platform Intellizence, leading companies that announced layoffs in 2025 include UPS (20,000), Dell (12,000), Nissan (12,000), Intel (10,000), HBC (8,300), Chevron (8,000), DHL (8,000), BP (7,700) and Audi (7,500). As per company filings cited by Bloomberg, Reliance Retail laid off 38,000 employees in 2024. Will anyone refuse to join these enterprises if they are recruiting again? We know severance pay is a question of intent and affordability for an enterprise. When Meta laid off 11,000 employees in 2022, the company paid $975 million in severance, about $88,000 per person on average. In a subsequent regulatory filing, the Facebook parent said “the impact of these costs was not material” as it was offset by what it saved in payroll and other employee benefits. A Bloomberg review of Russell 3000 companies that made layoffs between 2022 and 2024 showed that, on average, each laid-off worker received a severance pay of $40,000. The report also highlighted an extreme example of a healthcare company with an average payout of almost $212,000 per laid-off worker. Back home, when TCS recently announced its severance package for the 12,000-odd employees it intends to lay off, most of us termed the offer as generous. According to reports, affected employees will be offered a minimum of six months’ pay while those who have served 20 years will be given two years’ pay. Would you prefer a six-month or two-year salary paid upfront, rather than continuing with your job? It may depend on your personal and professional context. What if you don’t get your next job within the next six months? After 20 years in a single company that laid you off for want of better skills, what are the chances of getting a suitable job in two years? One can call the severance pay attractive if the laid-off person is able to secure a job before the money runs out. A severance paycheque is a ticking time bomb till you get your next job offer. Picture this: one gets a job well in time, and there is a handsome additional amount in the bank after getting laid off, thanks to the severance pay. Will you trade the money in the bank for feeling unwanted by your former employer? Are the uncertainties you had to go through, the anxieties, and the feeling of rejection caused during the redundancy period worth the money you received in the end? Let’s face it — in today’s world, the scars of layoffs are inevitable. Let’s believe that the scars show us where we have been and don’t dictate where we are going!
