Title: Dotdash, By The People, For The People; Mopping Up Social

Dashed Off On Tuesday, The Artist Formerly Known as Dotdash Meredith rebranded as People Inc. to reflect its best-known legacy brand. There are a number of reasons for the shift, including the fact that the previous name was simply “too clunky and cumbersome and weird,” Neil Vogel, People Inc.’s chief executive, tells The Wall Street Journal. Rebranding as People Inc. also pays homage to one of the company’s greatest successes: People’s monthly desktop and mobile visits more than doubled between June 2020 and June 2025, the WSJ reports. By comparison, some now former DDM publications, like Vanity Fair, saw a more than 50% decrease in monthly visits. The new name also reflects that “we are people making content for people,” Vogel tells The Hollywood Reporter. In an era of media marked by what Vogel referred to as “synthetic and artificial and amalgamated and mashed up” content, People Inc. will apparently put the “people” in, well, you get it. With print sales declining and media strategies shifting to new channels like TikTok, “we’ve learned that not all of our brands are going to have a future, and that’s okay,” Vogel tells THR. Instead, People will focus its attention on the channels seeing the most success – which, like People magazine, are those with “the history and the gravitas,” according to Vogel. Influence In The Aisle Fortune 500 consumer product brands like Unilever and Estée Lauder are suddenly all in on influencer marketing. Unilever’s new CMO, for one, vowed to spend as much as half of its paid media on influencer marketing. Procter & Gamble, the world’s highest-spending CPG advertiser, provided another example of this trend during its earnings report this week. For the new Swiffer PowerMop launch, P&G brought in TikTok and social media influencers to review the mop and speak with the execs who designed the product, CEO Jon Moeller told investors. The Swiffer team’s footage, together with the content created by influencers, is what P&G used to develop its TV and online video ads, he said. Moeller credited the PowerMop launch with kickstarting 40% growth for Swiffer’s portfolio and driving 35% of category growth, “making it the No. 1 growth driver in the category.” Bite Of The Apple Apple’s iOS 26 is slated to go live this month. One much-ballyhooed feature is the automatic filtering of unknown callers and text message senders to a new folder akin to spam. Politicians and political campaigners are alarmed because those messages are the meat and potatoes of political fundraising, Business Insider reports. Patrick Ruffini, a conservative pollster, notes in a Twitter thread that polling will be deeply affected. Online polls are not reliable and cannot be localized. The best, most reliable polling, like the NYT/Siena poll, relies on the exact methods being targeted by iOS 26. On the other hand, people universally hate the practice and will applaud Apple’s update. And, to be fair, political campaigns brought this on themselves. In 2020, all of the mobile wireless networks promoted their new anti-spam and scam policies, which affected some political messaging practices. A few weeks later, the Trump reelection campaign’s text fundraising campaign was suspended, because all the new systems identified it as spam, if not a scam. This precipitated vast congressional blowback, and the wireless networks later relented on those rules. But Wait! There’s More!

Title: Gloomy guidance and increased cloud competition weigh on Amazon’s stock, despite solid earnings beat

UPDATED 19:36 EDT / JULY 31 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were trading more than 6% lower after-hours today, after the e-commerce and cloud computing infrastructure giant could only offer light guidance for the current quarter. The decline came in the wake of some fairly decent numbers from Amazon as it posted its second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street’s targets on earnings and revenue. Amazon reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.68 per share, easily beating the $1.33 per share forecast, while revenue for the quarter came to $167.7 billion, up 13% from a year ago and ahead of the $162.09 billion analyst consensus estimate. The company also reported operating income of $19.2 billion for the quarter, up from $14.7 billion in the year-ago period, while net income came to $18.2 billion, up from $13.5 billion 12 months prior. However, what disturbed investors was the company’s miserable operating income outlook. Amazon said this could fall anywhere between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, but the midpoint of that range is substantially lower than Wall Street’s forecast of $19.48 billion. The guidance appears to have caused panic among investors, who are increasingly concerned about the company’s sky-high artificial intelligence investments. Amazon has previously committed to spending up to $100 billion this year on building out the data centers to run AI models, and software that makes use of them. Amazon’s stock headed south during a conference call, where Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) was busy fielding some tough questions from analysts regarding the level of spending and the increased competition it faces in the cloud. Jassy did his best to emphasize that Amazon retains a “significant” cloud leadership position, adding that he’s “optimistic” about the strength of its AI products and services. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy said in a statement. With regard to the cloud, the Amazon Web Services Inc. business unit delivered total sales of $30.87 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago and just ahead of the Street’s forecast of $30.8 billion. AWS continues to dominate the cloud computing infrastructure market, but its lead isn’t as big as it was, for it faces relentless competition in the face of Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC, and also even smaller players like Oracle Corp. and dedicated AI cloud providers, such as CoreWeave Inc. The company’s substantial lead in cloud makes it much harder for AWS to match those rival’s growth rates. While AWS revenue was up 18%, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud recorded growth rates of 39% and 32% in their most recent quarters, which means they’re slowly chipping away at Amazon’s lead. “We have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others,” Jassy told analysts in response to a question about the threat posed by those rivals. “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS.” AWS continues to be a major driver of profit for Amazon, generating operating income of $10.2 billion during the quarter, representing just over half of the company’s total. During the quarter, AWS revealed plans to open a new data center region in Chile before 2027, and said Pepsi Co. has signed up for a large multiyear contract that will see it move various critical workloads to the AWS cloud. Jassy insisted that customers continue to choose AWS because they see it as the industry’s most secure cloud infrastructure platform. “For most companies, they’re putting data that they really care about into the cloud,” he told analysts. “The security and privacy of that data matters a lot, and there are very different results in security in AWS than you’ll see in other players.” The results from Amazon’s advertising business were more encouraging, with ad revenue rising 23% from a year earlier to $15.69 billion, surging past the analyst target of $14.99 billion. Of course, the ad business remains much smaller than AWS or the company’s retail business, but it’s still responsible for a growing chunk of Amazon’s profits, as the world’s third-largest ad platform, behind only Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. last week reported that ad sales rose 10% in its most recent quarter, while Meta said yesterday that its ad revenue climbed 22%, slightly slower than Amazon’s, both off a bigger base. As for retail, sales in Amazon’s online stores increased 11% from a year earlier to $61.5 billion, surpassing the Street’s target of $59 billion, while the seller services unit delivered $40.3 billion in revenue, also up 11%. Analysts were expecting just $38.7 billion in sales there. Some analysts were more bullish about the company’s prospects. “In the end Amazon operates two high-margin growthy businesses and a massive low-margin logistics business with unmatched scale with the potential to materially juice margins medium to long term using AI in combination with robotics,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said in a note to clients. The firm raised its target price to $285 a share and reiterated its buy rating. Amazon’s prediction for third-quarter revenue was a little better, at least. The company estimates sales of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, which would mean growth of between 10% and 13%. That’s more optimistic than the Street, with analysts aiming for just $173.1 billion in third-quarter sales. Once again, Amazon’s guidance came with a caveat that warned how “recessionary fears” and “tariff and trade policies” could yet affect its results in unforeseen ways. The constantly shifting trade polices of U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially have a big impact on Amazon’s retail business, though consumer spending has so far proven resilient this year. On the conference call, Jassy told analysts that the tariffs haven’t impacted on consumer demand, nor have they driven up prices, as some had feared. “If costs end up being a little higher, we will absorb them,” he added. The after-hours price drop means that Amazon’s stock is up just over 6% in the year to date, trailing the broader S&P 500 Index, which has gained 8% in the same period.

Speaking with CNBC, billionaire banking boss Dimon said that stablecoins could be used in ways that fiat currency can't. "There are things that stablecoins maybe can do that your traditional cash can't," Dimon said, although he emphasized that the bank was looking to address client demand more than the bank's preferences. "It's what the customer wants," he said. "It's not what JP Morgan personally wants." Dimon's comments underscored his reservations about digital assets. Still, he expressed his belief in the potential usefulness of blockchain technology and his willingness to allow the banking giant to participate in the space. JP Morgan has introduced multiple cryptocurrency-focused initiatives in recent months. Earlier this week, JP Morgan announced a deal with America's largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, allowing customers to link their accounts to the platform and buy digital assets. Dimon has also recently praised stablecoins, a perspective he reiterated to CNBC. "I'm not against stablecoins," Dimon said. "I'm a believer in stablecoin, a believer in blockchain, not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you're the customer—I don't like to tell customers what they can and can't do with their money." Stablecoins are digital tokens running on blockchains—like Ethereum or Solana—that are pegged to non-volatile assets, usually dollars. With a stable value, such cryptocurrencies were previously used by traders to enter and exit digital asset trades without the need for banks. But now, banks, major companies, including Meta and Amazon, and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing the tokens, which are supposed to accelerate payments leveraging blockchain technology. This month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the U.S. JP Morgan's Coinbase deal means that Chase customers will be able to directly link bank accounts to their cryptocurrency wallets from next year. The bank also said it will "seamlessly and securely convert their points into cryptocurrencies." Publicly-traded Coinbase is the biggest exchange in the U.S. and allows users to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital coins and tokens. It also has a deal with the U.S. government to take custody of confiscated crypto. In the past, Dimon had been unsparing in his comments on Bitcoin, calling it a "pet rock" and valuable only to criminals. The bank has used blockchain technology in its products, though. NYSE-listed JP Morgan's stock was down by a little over 1% Thursday. Coinbase—which trades on the Nasdaq—was up marginally, by less than 1%.

The payments giant said that its infrastructure now supports PayPal’s PYUSD, Paxos-issued USDG, and Circle's EURC. Visa also said that clients using Visa's stablecoin services can accept the tokens via Avalanche and Stellar, too. Previously, Visa's stablecoin services were limited to blockchains Ethereum and Solana. Avalanche is a crypto network behind AVAX, the 22nd largest digital asset by market cap, and Stellar's native token, XLM, is the industry's 16th biggest crypto. AVAX was recently trading for $22.59, down more than 2.4% on the day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. XLM remained unchanged at $0.40. NYSE-listed Visa's stock, meanwhile, finished the day down by 1.5%, according to Google Finance data. "We believe that when stablecoins are trusted, scalable, and interoperable, they can fundamentally transform how money moves around the world," Visa's Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships at Visa, Rubail Birwadker, said in a statement. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies typically pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar to minimize price volatility. They were initially used primarily by traders to move funds without relying on traditional banks. But now, banks, major companies—including Meta and Amazon, reportedly—and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing stablecoins, which are supposed to accelerate payments using blockchain technology. Earlier this month, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first comprehensive federal framework for the issuance and regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation outlines requirements for issuers, sets standards for reserves and audits, and establishes clear rules for how stablecoins can be used and traded across financial markets. In 2021, Visa announced that it supported USD Coin on Ethereum. Since then, the company has introduced a number of other crypto-related ventures. In April, it partnered with Bridge, a unit of payment services provider Stripe, to offer stablecoin-linked debit cards in Latin American countries.

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken May 4, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK/LONDON :The U.S. dollar index rose on Thursday while MSCI's global equities gauge fell as stronger-than-expected megacap earnings reports were balanced against signs of rising inflation and investor anxiousness ahead of President Donald Trump's deadline for trade agreements. Trump gave Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs to negotiate a broader trade deal but was expected to issue higher final duty rates for most other countries as the clock wound down on the Friday deadline. Earlier in the day, an economic data release showed U.S. inflation increased in June as tariffs on imports started raising the cost of some goods, supporting economists' expectations that price pressures would pick up in the second half of the year. Thursday's data also showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits, while second-quarter U.S. labor costs increased slightly more than expected on a pick-up in wage growth.

Loading The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed to wait for more data before deciding whether to adjust rates in September, sending equities lower on the day and drawing further criticism from Trump.Indexes saw some support earlier on Thursday from better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms but by the end of the day, gains had evaporated. With the economic data appearing to support the Fed's more hawkish stance and an anxious wait for Friday's payroll report along with Trump's tariff deadline, investors had an awful lot to handle this week, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Schwab. "This is one of those weeks where it's almost too much information to digest, so the market is ignoring it all and staying in a tight range," Gordon said. However, he noted megacap strength was countering weakness elsewhere in the market including in small-cap companies, which have less latitude to cope with higher prices."You really only have communications services and parts of technology that are holding you up today. Breadth is generally pretty weak," the strategist said. The Russell 2000 small cap index ended down 0.93 per cent while the S&P 600 small cap index fell 1.17 per cent.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 330.30 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 44,130.98 and the S&P 500 was down 23.51 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 6,339.39 with only two of its 11 major industry sectors showing gains for the day.The Nasdaq Composite fell 7.23 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 21,122.45. For the month, the S&P 500 gained 2.17 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 3.7 per cent, while the Dow added 0.08 per cent.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 5.31 points, or 0.57 per cent, to 929.02.Earlier, the pan-European STOXX 600 index finished down 0.75 per cent, at a more than one-week low. European investors were disappointed by corporate earnings reports from the likes of Sanofi and Ferrari, while beverage makers slid as they were faced with a 15 per cent U.S. tariff. US DOLLAR EYES MONTHLY GAINIn currencies, the U.S. dollar was eyeing its first monthly gain for 2025 against major currencies, underpinned by hopes for clarity on trade policy and U.S. economic resilience.For the day, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26 per cent to 100.05.The euro was up 0.08 per cent at $1.1413 and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.23 per cent versus the dollar at 18.854. But against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.84 per cent to 150.76 after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady and increased its inflation forecast.The Korean won weakened 0.21 per cent against the dollar after Trump's announcement that the U.S. would charge a 15 per cent tariff on imports from South Korea, which would in return invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. In U.S. Treasuries, longer-dated yields were lower before the anticipated July jobs report, reversing an increase on Wednesday following Powell's comment.The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.6 basis points to 4.372 per cent, from 4.378 per cent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 4.8979 per cent.But the 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 2 basis points to 3.957 per cent, from 3.937 per cent late on Wednesday.In oil markets, prices fell 1 per cent after rising in each of the prior three sessions as investors considered the extension of an existing trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico and a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks put pressure on prices.U.S. crude settled down 1.06 per cent, or 74 cents at $69.26 a barrel while Brent settled at $72.53 per barrel, down 0.97 per cent, or 71 cents on the day.Gold prices rose as traders turned to the safe-haven asset on tariff uncertainty.

Title: Microsoft reaches $4 trillion market cap, three weeks after Nvidia

A few weeks ago, Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach the coveted $4 trillion market capitalization. This was on the back of a strong quarter where it raked in $44.1 billion, fueled by the strong demand for its AI-optimized hardware. Now, Microsoft has a similar story to tell following its latest fiscal quarter reports from yesterday. After informing investors and the public that it earned $76.4 billion in FY25 Q4, resulting in a net income of an eye-watering $27.2 billion, Microsoft's stock price has jumped by roughly 5%, which means that it has crossed the $4 trillion market cap. It is only the second company to reach this mark as others are quite a ways off. Apple stands strong at $3.1 trillion, Google's parent company Alphabet is at $2.3 trillion, and Meta is about to hit the $2 trillion-mark. It's not entirely surprising that Microsoft managed to reach this market cap so soon after its latest fiscal report. The company's reason for soaring market value is the same as Nvidia: AI and the cloud. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credited the firm's investments in the cloud and AI, also noting that Azure passed $75 billion in annual revenue. Other categories like Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing grew too. Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood also had the following to say: We closed out the fiscal year with a strong quarter, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud revenue reaching $46.7 billion, up 27% (up 25% in constant currency) year-over-year. While Microsoft celebrates reaching this milestone, it is also worth highlighting that the company recently laid off 9,000 employees despite enjoying a particularly strong quarter. Satya Nadella noted shortly after that the decision weighs heavily on him, but unfortunately, this is the "enigma of success". Whatever that means.

Aer Lingus and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) climbed 2.56 per cent to 380.5 pence on a good day for airlines, aided by strong Air France results.

Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce surged 8.5 per cent to 1,072p after the company boosted profit predictions on the back of strong results for the first half of the year. The company said operations could generate up to £3.2 billion profit this year, £300 million more than it originally forecast. The news continued a turnaround for the company, which makes engines for Airbus wide-body jets and luxury cars, since Tufan Erginbilgic joined as chief executive in 2023 Oil giant Shell advanced 1.19 per cent to 2,711p after announcing plans for a share buy-back programme.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested a wave of corporate earnings reports and economic data. The market is now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s policy statement expected on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. Shares of UnitedHealth dropped after the company forecasted annual profits below expectations. This impacted the broader healthcare sector. Whirlpool also experienced a significant decline, plunging after missing second-quarter earnings estimates and trimming its full-year profit outlook. UPS was another notable laggard, contributing to the decline in the Dow Transports index. In contrast, VF Corp experienced a surge in its stock price, rising about 13% in premarket trading. The company beat first-quarter revenue estimates, attributing this to increased demand for its apparel and footwear products. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange reacted to the mixed bag of earnings reports. They are bracing for further guidance from the Federal Reserve. The Fed kicked off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday alongside a busy slate of economic data. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady, investors remain on edge for any signs of economic weakness that could justify cuts later this year. Job openings and hirings both fell in June, setting the stage for the all-important monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw an uptick in July, but worries about job availability intensified, according to official figures. Big Tech earnings are in full swing this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to report after the bell on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon are due on Thursday. According to Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy Venu Krishna, Big Tech has been the lone major market cohort this year that’s had earnings growth outperform its actual price return. Krishna argues this supports Big Tech’s lofty valuations and is a key reason to remain bullish on the sector. Investors remain cautious as they await more corporate earnings reports and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision. The stock market’s trajectory will likely be influenced by these factors in the coming days.

Title: Zuckerberg Overtakes Bezos For World’s Third-Richest Person As Meta Rally Adds $28 Billion To His Fortune

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to become the world’s third-wealthiest person Thursday, as Meta’s stock surged in the wake of yet another earnings beat for the firm. Zuckerberg’s net worth jumped nearly 12% to $268.4 billion Thursday, an increase of about $28.4 billion, as Meta’s share price rallied more than 11%, pacing what would be the stock’s second-largest increase on the year. Zuckerberg, who holds a 13% stake in Meta, surpassed Amazon chairman Bezos ($247.4 billion) to become the third-richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, even as about $4.5 billion was added to Bezos’ net worth as Amazon shares jumped nearly 2%. Elon Musk remains the world’s richest person by far with a fortune valued at $403.5 billion as of Thursday, followed by Oracle chairman Larry Ellison ($306 billion) in second. 40%. That’s how much Meta’s share price has increased since falling to its lowest point this year in April. A surge in Meta’s share price and Zuckerberg’s fortune comes a day after the company reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that came well above projections. Meta reported $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 earnings per share, an annual increase of 22% and 38%, respectively, as the firm reported its 10th-straight quarter with a profit beat and its 12th straight for topping revenue estimates. Many investors focused on the company’s increased spending on artificial intelligence in recent months, as Meta announced an uptick in capital expenditures while it "aggressively [pursues] opportunities” related to its “artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.” Microsoft on Thursday became the second company to reach a market valuation of $4 trillion, joining Nvidia, as shares rose about 4%. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who holds a roughly 3% stake in the company, added about $4.9 billion to his net worth ($149 billion) during the company’s latest rally. Ballmer is the eighth-richest person in the world, according to our latest estimates, directly behind Google’s Sergey Brin ($151.5 billion) and right ahead of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault ($142.9 billion).

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta continues to pour billions into its AI efforts, while also reporting impressive revenue and profit growth for the second quarter. Zuckerberg believes his AI research team will produce a “personal superintelligence” available to everyone. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has been investing heavily in AI in recent years. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on a spending spree to hire top AI researchers, with the goal of building a “superintelligent” AI system. Meta’s latest quarterly results indicate that the company’s AI push is not slowing down. In its second-quarter earnings report, Meta announced that it would continue to increase its spending, particularly on the construction of data centers, which are essential for its AI initiatives. The company raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year and said that the rate of increase in its spending would jump even higher next year. Zuckerberg expressed his excitement about bringing “personal superintelligence to everyone.” Explaining, “We believe in putting this power in people’s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives” in a statement accompanying the earnings report. The company’s financial results for the second quarter were impressive, with revenue of $47.5 billion, a 22 percent increase from the same period last year and above Wall Street estimates of $44.8 billion. Profit also grew by 36 percent to $18.3 billion, surpassing expectations of $15.1 billion. Meta’s family of apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, had 3.48 billion daily users in June, a six percent increase from a year ago.. While investors were initially skeptical of Meta’s focus on the metaverse in 2021, they have been more patient with the company’s AI investments, largely because AI has become a central focus for the entire tech industry. However, there is growing pressure on Meta’s new AI team to deliver results quickly, particularly in terms of improving the company’s core advertising business. Analysts believe that Meta’s long-term plan is to expand its AI capabilities beyond advertising, potentially developing chatbots and personal assistants that can mimic human interactions. However, in the short term, the company’s stock price will likely be influenced by how AI impacts its existing business.

Title: Comcast’s Q2 Earnings Show Streaming Momentum, But Legacy Pressures Persist

Investors rewarded Meta on Wednesday for reporting stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings, driven by robust ad revenue growth and promising user engagement metrics. The company’s stock rose more than 11% in after-hours trading. The following morning, investors rewarded Comcast for losing fewer broadband and video subscribers than expected in Q2, with a roughly 5% bump in share price during premarket trading. It’s a study in contrasts. In all fairness, though, you can’t really compare a broadcaster’s business with a Big Tech company. Despite the growth and promise of Peacock, Comcast, which reported second quarter earnings on Thursday, is still navigating big challenges in its legacy business lines, namely ongoing declines in broadband and cable TV subscribers. Sporting chance That said, NBCU’s streaming losses were down to $100 million in Q2 from $348 million year over year, representing significant progress as the platform nears break-even. Although total advertising revenue for the media segment overall was down 7% due to tough political comparisons and the volume and timing of sports content – Q2 has historically been a seasonally light sports quarter for Comcast – Peacock’s revenue was up 18% in the second quarter to $1.2 billion. Peacock’s subscriber base also remained steady at 41 million. “Steady” is, of course, another way to say “flat.” But executives are optimistic that, once the upcoming NBA season begins in October, subscriptions will grow. NBCU signed an 11-year media rights agreement with the NBA last year that will bring the NBA to Peacock and back to NBC for the first time since the early 2000s. “The second quarter has historically lacked tentpole sports, so we’ve been more susceptible to fluctuations in general entertainment ratings,” said Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong. “We look forward to that changing next year with the launch of the NBA.” Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Playing the long game Comcast can also look forward to spending a heck of a lot of money for those NBA rights. It’s shelling out $2.45 billion per year, which will total roughly $27 billion over the course of the partnership. But it’s totally worth it, Comcast executives told investors. The NBA will give NBCU the ability to deliver sports programming throughout the year and it was also a sweetener for advertisers during upfront negotiations. Several weeks ago, NBCU announced the highest overall ad sales volume commitments in the company’s history and its largest sports commitments to date. A “big piece of that is having the NBA in there,” said Comcast President Mike Cavanagh. “That’s delivered strongly.” And, hey, Peacock didn’t even exist five years ago and now it’s on a clear path to profitability with narrowing losses. “Obviously, there are a lot of challenges in the ecosystem, but we took on the challenge and opportunity of creating a streaming service,” Cavanagh said. “Our overall media results this quarter were driven by the continued meaningful progress we’re making in our pivot to streaming.”

Title: Vertiv Stock Up 27%. Google, Meta, Microsoft AI Spend To Drive Growth

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Vertiv's strong financial performance and raised outlook are primarily fueled by massive capital expenditures from hyperscalers like Meta and Microsoft, driven by the escalating infrastructure demands of AI data centers.The company, a key supplier of power and cooling solutions, anticipates continued rapid growth due to its competitive advantages, substantial backlog, and the increasing energy needs of advanced AI chips, despite some analyst valuation concerns. Vertiv stock is up 27% this year after posting results that beat expectations and raising the company’s forecast, according to Investor’s Business Daily. A big reason for Vertiv’s success is the ever rising capital expenditures of companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, reported the Wall Street Journal. Vertiv supplies hyperscalers hardware and services to power and cool the data centers where chatbot providers like OpenAI train and operate their AI models, according to my book Brain Rush. While Vertiv also supplies such infrastructure to other customer groups – such as communication networks and commercial and industrial facilities – AI is the source of the fastest growth, according to my July 30 interview with Vertiv CEO Gio Albertazzi. Vertiv’s future prospects look bright for two reasons: To be fair, Vertiv shares could have limited upside. How so? A survey of 15 Wall Street analysts reveals an average 12 month price target of $144 – making the stock 4% overvalued, according to TipRanks. Vertiv’s second quarter results exceeded investor expectations and the company raised its full year outlook, according to IBD. Here are the key numbers: “Vertiv’s second-quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our market position and our ability to execute at scale,” Albertazzi said in a news release. “Our 35% sales growth and robust orders momentum reflect both strong market demand and our expanded capabilities to serve our customers' increasingly complex infrastructure needs.” Vertiv’s 35% sales growth is more than three times faster than the industry’s expected rate of expansion. The company’s competitive advantages suggest the company is winning more market share. Vertiv’s total addressable market – providing hardware and services for data centers, communications, and commercial and industrial customers – amounts to $60 billion and is growing at a 9% to 11% annual rate, according to Albertazzi. The data center segment – featuring hyperscalers (such as AWS and Microsoft’s Azure cloud), neocloud providers (like CoreWeave), and data center companies like Equinix – is growing at a 15% to 17% annual rate, he added. Before July 30, when they reported expectations-beating quarterly growth, both Meta and Microsoft “were already on track to spend more than 30% of this year’s revenue on capital expenditures, compared with about 15% to 20% historically,” the Journal reported. Meta and Microsoft seem to have different plans for spending. In pursuit of “superintelligence,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making a “massive investment,” noted the Journal – including up to $72 billion this year and $100 billion next year, noted the New York Times. Zuckerberg expects it will take years for the investment to pay off. “We do take very seriously that this is just a massive amount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute, which we think is going to help us produce leading research and quality products and in running the business,” he said on Meta’s earnings call. For its part, Microsoft projected record capital expenditures of $30 billion for the current quarter although the software giant “envisions slower spending growth in the year ending June 2026 than in 2025,” according to the Journal. Still, that could amount to $120 billion, the Times noted. Vertiv expects hyperscaler AI capital expenditure growth to persist. “By investing in more capacity – which gives hyperscalers an advantage – they are implicitly confirming their expectations for monetization,” Albertazzi told me. Vertiv is benefiting from using AI to grow revenue faster than fixed costs. How so? The company’s AI applications include configuring its supply chain, executing tariff countermeasures, improving the company’s overall speed and efficiency, and providing long-term value to customers, he explained. Vertiv offers a range of hardware and services. Roughly a third of the company’s revenue comes from cooling – such as liquid cooling systems about which I wrote in Brain Rush; a third from power management; and 22% from services to speed data center deployment, according to Albertazzi. Vertiv wins because of its role as an industry thought leader – which enables the company to participate in creating the future. “We are part of an industry ecosystem including silicon providers like Nvidia and hyperscalers," he said. "Our engineers work with their engineers to design data centers for the future. We also respond to requests for proposal and requests for quotation. There are transactions but also collaboration. We are in the fabric, in the loop. We have a track record throughout the life cycle.” Vertiv expects strong growth as evidenced by the following metrics from the company’s Q2 2025 investor presentation: Vertiv sees many new growth vectors as customers deploy new technologies. “Growth will come from cooling, power management, white spaces within IT, and digitization of predictive maintenance,” Albertazzi explained. “Demand for liquid cooling is in its infancy. There is growing demand for data center access to power that is grid independent. We are collaborating with Oklo to deploy small nuclear reactors – which can get into production much more quickly than traditional nuclear plants. We will provide hardware to meet the power requirements of new graphics processing units such as Nvidia’s Rubin. And we will help design and build data centers using prefabrication to reduce deployment time,” he added. GPU improvements are likely to sustain demand for Vertiv’s products and services. As Nvidia and rivals introduce new GPUs, their computational power and energy consumption rise. “A rack with the latest AI chips requires the same power as 10 to 15 racks at a conventional site,” according to the Financial Times. In January 2025, Wall Street analysts saw Vertiv’s stock as overvalued, noted my post on Forbes. Yet the stock has continued to rise. Satisfying the ever increasing power and cooling needs of AI data centers may keep propelling Vertiv’s stock ahead of investor expectations.

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram has seen its share price blitz from $90 to $784 in the last three years Meta raced to a new all-time high on Wall Street on Thursday morning, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram seeing its share price increase more than 13% to $784.70 per share. The big jump comes a day after Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reported $47.52 billion in second quarter revenue — easily topping analyst projections. Meta also estimated it would report up to $50 billion in third quarter sales, which also pleased investors, while Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li, on the earnings call, reiterated that the company is focused on investing heavily in artificial intelligence. And on the topic of AI, Zuckerberg said “superintelligence” — where AI models beat humans in nearly all tasks — is “in sight.” His comments on continuing to invest in artificial intelligence come after he said in January this would be a “defining year for AI.” That same month, Zuckerberg said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on the tech — a figure Meta once again noted in its second quarter report on Wednesday. Zuckerberg has already put Meta’s money where his mouth is, with the company investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models, in June. Meta also recently poached four top OpenAI researchers for its AI team, as the company has been extending multiyear offers that reach up to $300 million. Meta’s previous all-time high was $747.90 per share, set just a month ago. The Menlo Park, California-based company’s stock dipped in the weeks leading up to its Wednesday earnings report, but on the year, Meta’s stock is now up 31%. You can take an up-to-the-minute look at Meta’s stock price, below: Other standout figures from Meta’s report included net income of $18.34 billion — up 22% year-over-year — and the company said 3.48 billion people now use one of its apps on a daily basis, although Meta did not share specifics on how each of its platforms is performing. Meta’s big run on Wall Street stands out, considering where the company was just a few years ago. In 2022, Meta’s stock price dropped to $90 per share, after Zuckerberg heavily pushed the “Metaverse” — but the masses ended up not being as excited about the virtual world as he was. Other tech giants will be sharing their latest earnings reports in the upcoming days, including Apple and Amazon, which are both set to report their Q2 financials on Wednesday afternoon.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a strong Q4 performance, surpassing consensus estimates for earnings, sales, and its future outlook. This positive news has sent the stock up 8% in pre-market trading, extending its impressive rally of over 50% since its April low of around $350. Despite this significant climb, we believe there’s still considerable upside potential. While Microsoft's current valuation is high, we see minimal cause for concern, making it an attractive investment. Our optimistic view stems from a comprehensive analysis comparing MSFT's current valuation to its recent operating performance and its historical and current financial health. We've assessed Microsoft across key parameters: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This analysis reveals Microsoft's exceptionally strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – META Stock To $1,500? Microsoft has demonstrated notable revenue growth in recent years, outperforming the S&P 500. Over the last three years, its top line has grown at an average rate of 12.5%, compared to 5.3% for the S&P 500. In the most recent twelve-month period, revenues increased by 14.9% from $245 billion to $282 billion, while the S&P 500 saw 4.4% growth. Quarterly revenues in the most recent period grew 18% to $76.4 billion from $65 billion a year ago, against a 4.5% improvement for the S&P 500. This consistent, strong revenue expansion supports the company's robust market position. Microsoft exhibits exceptionally high profit margins, considerably exceeding most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Its operating income over the last four quarters was $129 billion, translating to a substantial operating margin of 45.6%, in contrast to 18.3% for the S&P 500. The company’s operating cash flow (OCF) for the same period was $136 billion, indicating a very high OCF margin of 48.3% compared to 19.8% for the S&P 500. Furthermore, Microsoft’s net income of $102 billion over the last four quarters yielded a considerable net income margin of 36.1%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 11.8%. These strong profitability metrics underscore Microsoft's efficient operations and effective cost management. Microsoft’s balance sheet is characterized by very strong financial stability. As of the most recent quarter, its debt stood at $61 billion, with a market capitalization of close to $4 trillion. This translates to a very strong debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5%, which is substantially lower than the S&P 500’s 23.4%. The company also maintains a healthy cash position, with cash (including cash equivalents) making up $95 billion of its $619 billion in total assets, resulting in a strong cash-to-assets ratio of 15.3% compared to 6.7% for the S&P 500. These figures highlight Microsoft's robust financial health and its ability to manage its liabilities effectively. Microsoft stock has generally shown slightly better resilience than the broader markets during recent economic downturns. During the Inflation Shock of 2022, MSFT fell 37.6% but fully recovered by June 15, 2023. In the Covid Pandemic of 2020, MSFT saw a 28.2% decline from its peak, recovering fully by June 9, 2020, outperforming the S&P 500’s 33.9% drop. Look at Buy or Sell MSFT stock for more details. Overall, Microsoft demonstrates very strong performance across growth, profitability, and financial stability, with its downturn resilience being neutral. This comprehensive analysis points to an overall very strong outlook for MSFT stock. Microsoft’s stock currently commands a premium valuation when compared to the broader market, as well as some of its peers, reflected in its key multiples. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.6, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 3.1. Similarly, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.7 substantially exceeds the benchmark’s 22.8. This is higher than its peers, with META stock trading less than 30 times and AMZN stock trading at 39 times trailing earnings. This elevated valuation suggests market confidence in Microsoft's future performance and its strong competitive position. Microsoft's recent performance strongly suggests that a premium valuation is well-deserved. The accelerating growth in Azure revenues, coupled with improving profitability and a robust outlook, points towards a sustained upward revision in its valuation multiple. While the stock currently trades at over 40 times trailing earnings, it has historically commanded premium valuations; for example, its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last four years is 35 times. Consequently, we believe there is still further upside potential for MSFT stock, despite its recent surge. Of course, this optimistic view carries inherent risks. Investors might become hesitant to pay an even higher premium, particularly given the substantial capital expenditure Microsoft is directing towards AI initiatives. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly consider all associated risks before making any investment decisions. However, for those with a 3−5 year investment horizon, MSFT stock, even at its current levels, could offer significant upside potential. Related – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Now, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: META Stock To $1,500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $370 levels in early 2024 to approximately $780 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI integration – the main growth engine for Meta. Meta’s AI investments are delivering tangible business results. The company’s advertising revenue reached $46.6 billion in Q2 2025, up 21.5% year-over-year, with pricing growth continuing to propel the core business. Average price per ad increased 9% in the latest quarter, demonstrating Meta’s ability to extract premium value from its AI-enhanced targeting capabilities. The scale of AI integration is significant. Meta's generative AI tools are finding purchase with both users and advertisers, while the company's Llama models are supporting core ad ranking and content recommendations. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional social media advertising to AI-powered precision marketing. While Meta stock holds promise, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Is There More Upside For MSFT Stock? For Meta stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually, along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: AI Monetization in Core Advertising: Driving Engagement & User Growth: Strategic Bets & New Revenue Streams: Operational Efficiencies & Cost Management: We anticipate Meta Platforms’ revenues to surpass $265 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028, due to improved profitability. Currently, META stock trades around $780, pricing it at roughly 28 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 39 times earnings and Microsoft at 41 times earnings. Given Meta’s deep integration of AI and its improving profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $1,300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Meta’s Valuation Ratios Comparison. The most significant risk is the intensifying competition in AI. Competition from cost-efficient solutions like DeepSeek raises questions about Meta's massive AI infrastructure investments and whether the company can maintain its technological moat. Regulatory pressure on social media platforms could also limit Meta’s ability to monetize user data and expand into new markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Meta’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. For more details, see – Buy or Sell META Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like META less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Overall, Meta’s path to doubling again depends on successfully monetizing its AI investments while achieving a Reality Labs inflection point. The company's dominant position in social media advertising, combined with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, creates multiple avenues for sustained growth. However, investors should recognize that reaching $1,500 per share would require Meta to demonstrate that its massive AI spending translates into sustainable competitive advantages and that Reality Labs can transition from a cost center to a growth driver. The opportunity exists, but execution risk remains high as competition intensifies across all of Meta’s key markets. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Crypto markets see $200M in liquidations as Fed’s Powell gives hawkish remarks

A wave of volatility swept through the cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks on inflation and tariffs sent leveraged traders scrambling. The sudden market tremor resulted in over $200 million in liquidations in a single hour, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $116,000 mark. The US central bank, as expected, left its benchmark interest rates unchanged in its latest policy decision. However, it was Chair Powell’s subsequent comments that captured the market’s full attention. He insisted on the potential for inflationary pressures to re-emerge, particularly from the impact of trade tariffs. This cautious stance was maintained even as two Federal Reserve officials dissented from the decision, signaling their preference for an immediate rate cut. The crypto market’s reaction to Powell’s hawkish tone was swift and sharp. In the hour that he spoke, liquidations of leveraged positions spiked to over $200 million across all digital assets, according to data from CoinGlass. Bitcoin (BTC) felt the immediate pressure, dipping below $116,000. However, the sell-off proved to be short-lived. Later in the session, Bitcoin managed to bounce back above $117,000, though it was still down 0.8% for the day and continued to trade at the lower end of its tight, three-week range. Ether (ETH) experienced a similar whipsaw, initially sliding by as much as 3% before recovering to trade at $3,750, ending the period with a modest loss of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins initially posted even steeper declines, with Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens all dropping by 4%-5% before paring their losses. Meme coins like BONK and PENGU plunged by as much as 10% each before also bouncing back. This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.

Twenty years ago, Facebook came out with a new feature that let you poke your friends. (Remember pokes?) Now, Meta is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI to purportedly develop “personal superintelligence,” in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s words, that teaches itself and outpaces human cognition. Quite the evolution. “AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think is now in sight,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Wednesday. “Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives.” Zuckerberg waxed poetic about a not-so-far-off future in which superintelligence “empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.” Cool, cool. But, meanwhile, Meta remains primarily an advertising company. Total revenue in the second quarter was $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, with advertising accounting for nearly all of that at $46.6 billion, up 21% YOY. Meta’s stock soared by more than 11% in after-hours trading. Ad-romeda Meta is making a massive investment in AI because “we have a conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do,” Zuckerberg said. And that includes improving ad performance, of course. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Zuckerberg attributed Meta’s particularly strong performance in Q2 to its ads business “unlocking greater efficiency and gains” by applying AI across its system. For example, in Q2, Meta introduced new personalization enhancements to Andromeda, its AI-powered recommendation model for ads. Andromeda underpins the ad retrieval stage of Meta’s ad system by selecting several thousand relevant ads to serve at any given moment from a pool of tens of millions of potential candidates. These improvements drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% more on Facebook, according to Zuckerberg. Andromeda is also being rolled out to new surfaces, including Facebook Reels. Pricing and performance Meta’s “engagement tailwinds,” in the words of CFO Susan Li, led to an 11% uptick in the total number of ad impressions across all of Meta’s properties, although ad load optimizations on Facebook were also a factor. And demand was there to meet the scaled-up supply. The average price per ad increased by 9% in the second quarter driven by improved ad performance. Although pricing growth overall slowed modestly quarter over quarter because of accelerated impression growth in Q2 across the family of apps. These results are directly related to Meta’s focus on improving monetization efficiency, Li said. “We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people,” she said. A-eye But even as Meta refines the mechanics of its advertising system, its vision is fixed on advanced AI intelligence and, well, eyeglasses. Although overall VR headset sales declined, sales of AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses have tripled year over year. In response to an investor question about whether smart glasses will eventually replace smartphones, Zuckerberg answered with a “yes, and.” He views glasses as the ideal form factor for AI because people can engage both visually and auditorily while staying hands-free and, unlike in virtual reality, connected to their physical surroundings. “I wear contact lenses, and if I didn’t have my vision corrected, I’d be at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world,” Zuckerberg said. “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, [you’ll] probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people who you’re working with or competing against.”

Title: Meta Seizes Its Moment to Spend More Aggressively in the AI Race

(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is taking advantage of its lucrative advertising business and stepping up spending next year, with executives saying now is the time to seize on investment opportunities in artificial intelligence. Investors cheered the plan, sending shares up more than 10% in after-hours trading. The social media giant reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates and forecast better-than-expected results for the current quarter. “We really believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI, as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told investors during a call. Meta executives underscored that its evolving AI technology, which has been integrated into its ads products, is already producing “meaningful” revenue. Meta and its big tech peers, including Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., are relying on their legacy businesses to fund their pursuits of pricey AI talent and data centers, adding billions to their spending plans with full support from Wall Street. Meta lifted the low end of its forecast for 2025 capital expenditures, while also providing early steer on 2026 spending. Meta said costs will continue to grow at an even faster pace next year — particularly as it focuses on AI infrastructure needs and the niche technical talent that can fine-tune its models. The strategy only works for Meta if the company keeps printing money from advertising. So far, it is. Meta’s current-quarter sales are expected to be $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion, Meta said. The midpoint of that range exceeded the average analyst estimate of $46.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That ads business, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said, is already seeing a “meaningful” amount of revenue from new generative AI features. “On advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system,” he said. Meta “crushed it” in the quarter, in part because AI improvements allowed the company to increase the average price of its ads, Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email. “All this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.” Meta stock was up 19% so far this year before Wednesday’s report. Zuckerberg is spending to build new data centers and lure top AI researchers with compensation packages valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, Bloomberg has reported. The company recently restructured its internal AI division, now referred to as Meta Superintelligence Labs, in an effort to build human-level AI capabilities and apply that technology across its products. The group is led by Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labeling company Scale AI, who joined Meta in June after Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the company. Wall Street has previously been more skeptical of Zuckerberg’s big bets on new technology. He renamed the company Meta after the “metaverse,” the idea that people would work and socialize in a virtual world with the help of headsets. That vision has been slow to take hold. At the same time, Meta’s hardware division has come under scrutiny for bleeding cash for years. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated $370 million in revenue — less than the $386 million analysts expected — with $4.5 billion in operating losses. While the company sold more smart glasses, it saw a decline in sales for its Quest headsets. AI is different, because Meta’s competitors are making similar decisions. Last week, Alphabet raised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion due to higher AI spending. At Microsoft, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company would spend upwards of $30 billion in the current quarter, which would be at least 50% more than the outlay during the same period a year earlier. “In some ways, this race is historically akin to the races for the PC, web browser, search engine and smartphone,” Mike Proulx, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in a note. “But the big difference is that this race is pacing so much faster because AI — the very thing that Meta and others are racing towards — helps to accelerate itself.” Proulx added that to win the AI race, companies will need to reach into their “deep pockets.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
