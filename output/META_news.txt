Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 27, 2025 at 10:50 PM Updated: January 28, 2025 at 5:31 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. Recommended Videos The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji’s stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Asian shares are trading mixed after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays. Among technology companies in Japan, SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, plunging 6%. Hitachi Ltd. lost 7%, but Fujitsu and Sony Corp. recovered. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 5.5%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 1% after a marathon news conference overnight by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia’s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. Markets are also awaiting earnings reports later this week from Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 36 cents to $73.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 42 cents to $77.50 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 155.71 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0441, down from $1.0493. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

NEW YORK (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks are driving U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 was 1% higher in late trading and clawing back nearly two-thirds of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152 points, or 0.3%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher after sliding 3.1 % the day before.

Title: New Zealand Superannuation Fund takes DeepSeek hit

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. We’re all a little poorer after Nvidia’s 17% dive on Tuesday (the stock had stabilised in early Wednesday NZT trading). The Nasdaq-listed chipmaker’s stock took a battering on fears that China’s low-cost DeepSeek AI heralds a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) that takes less computer grunt to train; essentially, fewer of Nvidia’s expensive chips. The promise is ChatGPT-level results (as long as you don’t ask it about Tiananmen Square) on a Temu budget. Software makers incorporate DeepSeek into their own apps at no cost. A ton of people have also tried DeepSeek for themselves over the past few days, pushing it to number one on Apple and Google’s app stores. It looks and feels a lot like ChatGPT, if you use that on your phone. You can also access DeepSeek via the web. “A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models’ workings as proprietary, DeepSeek’s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on,” says the Financial Times’ Lex. ”On the outside” is a reference to DeepSeek’s “open-source” model. Essentially that means software developers can access it for free and then tweak it to their own ends at low cost. The rise of the apparently much more computing-efficient DeepSeek could also lead to questions over “StarGate” – a AI infrastructure initiative co-announced by OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in the Oval Office last week as Donald Trump looked on. The new President’s administration won’t chip in any funds toward the US$100 billion ($176b) to US$500b project, but has made loosely defined promises to clear red tape. Nvidia was coming off an epic bull run that had seen it become the single biggest equity holding in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s $81.6b portfolio. Many growth KiwiSaver funds have also been heavy on the stock. The AI feeding frenzy saw Nvidia’s stock gain 171% last year and kept powering upwards into early January, consolidating its position as the world’s most valuable company. But today’s rout wiped US$590b ($1.03 trillion) from Nvidia’s market value – the biggest one-day hit in Wall Street history, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollar terms. Nvidia’s market cap fell to US$2.9t, pushing it into third place behind Apple and Microsoft. In its most recent portfolio disclosure (June 2024), the NZ Super Fund said it owned 7,856,082 Nvidia shares – which would have been worth around $2.09b on Friday and $355 million less today. The question now is whether DeepSeek has triggered the start of a months-long correction in the price of AI-related stocks and tech stocks in general – or whether the deep freakout over DeepSeek will dissipate overnight (which it seems has been the case from early Wednesday trading). The Wall Street Journal and others have noted that, so far, there’s little hard evidence of DeepSeek’s vaunted ability to be trained at ultra-low cost, using fewer chips and the geek set is arguing over whether it’s truly open source. And many are dubious that DeepSeek took just US$5.5m to develop as its makers claim, even if sanctions mean it was likely trained on cheaper, lower-grade Nvidia chips. But against that, many have seen AI stocks as being in a bubble (Nvidia is doing extremely well – its net profit increased 16% over the past quarter and 109% year-on-year to US$19.31b in the three months to October 27, 2024 – but arguably not US$3t worth of well in a world where AI faces potential energy constraints). Investors can’t spread their bets by buying into DeepSeek; it’s owned by a Chinese hedge fund called High Flyer. The NZ Super Fund – and Big Tech-heavy KiwiSaver growth funds – will be keeping a wary eye on the other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, where the news was mixed today. Google parent Alphabet was down 4.0%. Microsoft – the major backer of ChatGPT maker OpenA – was down 2.1%. Tesla was down 2.3%. (While CEO Elon Musk has talked up the potential of AI to drive growth at the EV maker – particularly with coming robo-taxis – its recent fall away has been more tied to Trump’s executive order calling for an end to EV subsidies, or at least discussion on that point). Shares in Amazon – which has a major stake in AI firm Anthropic, maker of the Claude generative AI – were flat. Claude could take a hit from DeepSeek, but the generative AI forms a relatively small part of the tech giant’s business. Apple actually climbed 3.3%. Some analysts saw DeepSeek’s emergence as a validation of Apple’s decision to develop its own chips in-house to power its Apple Intelligence. Meta shares were also in the green. The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and the developer of the open-source Llama large language model was up 1.9%. Some have seen the company overspending on AI development. Its CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Friday his firm would spend as much as US$60b to US$65b on AI this year as it builds a massive new data centre and develops a new version of Llama. Analysts said DeepSeek illustrated that AI could be developed on a more cost-effective basis. In its most recent portfolio disclosure, the NZ Super Fund had 2,216,984 shares in Microsoft worth $1.63b; 4,512,851 shares in Apple worth $1.56b; 3,280,616 shares in Alphabet worth $984m; 2,491,984 shares in Amazon worth $790m; 640,325 shares in Meta, worth $529m; and 687084 shares in Tesla worth $223m.

Title: Nvidia calls China’s DeepSeek R1 model ‘an excellent AI advancement’: Breakthrough creates more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 5:44:32 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia called DeepSeek’s R1 model “an excellent AI advancement,” despite the Chinese startup’s emergence causing the chip maker’s stock price to plunge 17% on Monday. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

I expect that there will be a lot more focus on optimizing the model building algorithms, which will be great. Stargate’s $500 billion will produce $25 trillion or more in AI processing.

Surprising small trained models could do almost anything. I am actually going to download and run their 32GB model to have a local reasoning. But I already fine-tune models for art, writing, and coding. The massive expenditure in 100,000 GPU farms never really made any sense.

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment. Veloce Fintech, a part of the Lemon Group, had launched its SEBI-registered Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), the Veloce Opportunities Fund. The fund has crossed ₹140 crores in commitments, including a ₹40 crore green shoe option, aiming for a total target corpus of ₹200 crores, which will be closed in the next few months. Out of the ₹140 crores in commitments, total drawdown & deployment has crossed ₹100 crores. Focused on providing venture debt and pre-IPO funding to MSMEs, the fund aims to bridge the gap between growth capital requirements and structured investment opportunities. Veloce Fintech specializes in connecting ARCs, Real Estate Developers, MSMEs and startups with institutional lenders and investors. The Fund, managed by a team of experts, leveraging their extensive experience and industry insights, strives to drive long term growth for its portfolio companies while generating consistent high returns for the fund investors. Targeting over 20 companies, the Veloce Opportunities Fund seeks businesses with clear growth trajectories, robust governance practices, and scalable models. Using a sector-agnostic approach, it supports enterprises in diverse fields such as manufacturing, technology, real estate, healthcare, and services. The fund targets a return of 18+%. Given its pre-ponderance on debt, regular interest income and quicker cash flows from investments, the fund expects a higher level of consistency in payouts with lower volatility of returns.

The unit has now received an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) classifying the facility as Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI). Stock traded at ₹1,160.50 on the NSE, down 1.34% Indian equity benchmarks opened higher on Tuesday morning, rebounding from Monday’s sell-off, as the Reserve Bank of India’s liquidity-boosting measures lifted sentiment amid mixed global cues and ongoing concerns about US tech valuations following Chinese AI developments. The Sensex opened higher at 75,659.00 compared to its previous close of 75,366.17 and is currently trading at 75,714.06, up by 347.89 points or 0.46 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened at 22,960.45 against its previous close of 22,829.15 and is now at 22,908.75, gaining 79.60 points or 0.35 per cent. The positive start came after RBI announced plans to purchase government securities worth ₹60,000 crore through open market operations and conduct a $5-billion USD/rupee swap auction. Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

At 9.23 am on Tuesday, April Brent oil futures were at $76.20, up by 0.03 per cent, and March crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $73.19, up by 0.03 per cent.

ENERGY International crude oil prices tumbled on Monday amid concern that weakness in China’s economy will keep its energy demand depressed. Also, Monday’s stock rout sparked a risk-off sentiment in asset markets. Losses in crude were contained as the dollar index fell to a 5-week low. International crude prices have started marginally higher this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the outcome of the Fed meeting. NYMEX WTI March range for the day is between $70.65 to $76.20, while the MCX February crude futures could trade within the range of 6,110 to 6,560. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 6500 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 6000 strike for 17 February 2025 expiry. NYMEX and domestic natural gas tumbled on Monday to a 2-week low and closed sharply lower on the outlook for warmer US temperatures early next month. The Commodity Weather Group said that forecasts moved warmer for the central part of the US for February 1 to 5 and could reduce demand for gas. NYMEX Gas prices have started flat this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading. NYMEX Gas March range for the day is between $3.080 to $3.420, while the MCX February NG futures could trade within the range of 268 to 294. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade. From an intraday perspective, international copper has started mixed this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading as there is broader risk-off sentiment across base metals. The Dollar Index and bond yields gained this Tuesday morning ahead of Fed. Although, the beginning of the Chinese New Year holiday today will keep volumes low. Intraday, the range for LME copper is between $8,940 to $9,320, while that for MCX February copper is between 814 to 846. On the MCX Copper options side, highest Call OI is at 840 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 840 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. Most other metals on LME have started weaker this early Monday morning in Asian trading. Domestically, the range for MCX aluminium February is 245 to 253, while that for MCX zinc February is 266 to 273 and that for MCX lead February is 178 to 181 Currency The Indian Rupee opened weaker against the Dollar on Tuesday tracking a decline in most of its regional peers amid dampened risk appetite. A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week. Key triggers today will be Durable goods orders. The Euro ended marginally higher on Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia amid forecasts of a rate cut from the ECB this week. The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46%, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07%, to 19,341.83. Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins. The oil refiner’s Q3 earnings were affected by weak performance from petchem segment, lower refining margins, inventory loss and absorption of under-recovery on LPG. HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. DCB Bank over the last 4-5 quarters consistently grew its loan book and deposits at ~20% on a YoY basis. During the quarter, the Bank reported a strong loan book growth of 23%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis, with the mortgage/AIB segment contributing 45%/24% of the loan book, demonstrating a growth of 6%/3% on a QoQ and 21% each on a YoY basis. Co-lending has played a significant role in the current quarter, contributing to the surge in loan growth from 18-19% to 23% on a YoY basis. NII grew by 15%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis. NIM was stable on a QoQ basis at ~3.3%. During the quarter, the Bank’s core fee income increased by 49%/2% on a YoY/QoQ basis and costto-income ratio witnessed an improvement of 191/156 bps on a YoY/QoQ basis which led to a PPOP growth of 28%/6% on a YoY/QoQ basis. The Bank is showcasing continuous decline of slippages while the stress on MFI portfolio remained challenging, resulting in higher provisions by 64%/47% on a YoY/QoQ basis. Going forward, management aims to improve NIM, reduce cost-to-income ratio, and achieve an ROA of >1% in FY26. Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India. The stock began the week on a positive note, surging 6 per cent on Monday. A complex inverted head and shoulder pattern is visible on the daily chart. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹101. Below this, the broad ₹100-₹97 region is the next strong support.

Bengaluru - DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up that is just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) models that offer comparable performance to the worldâs best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeekâs emergence may offer a counterpoint to the belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled as hype around DeepSeekâs innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and hardware suppliers. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Mr Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January.Â The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAIâs ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its new AI model, R1, offers performance on a par with OpenAIâs latest and has granted licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Â Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeekâs models appears to be only a fraction of what is required for OpenAI or Meta Platformsâ best products. The modelâs much-better efficiency puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China, which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks: MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the countryâs advances in AI, the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it is unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has showed enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing the countryâs progress. The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. It gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January became known as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it âAIâs Sputnik momentâ. OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said on X: âDeepSeekâs R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what theyâre able to deliver for the price.â The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and Britain, according to market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Mr Liang received bachelorâs and mastersâ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek in 2023 with 10 million yuan (S$1.9 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fund-raising, he told Chinese media outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem.Â âMore investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,â Mr Liang said. Chinaâs technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu to Tencent Holdings, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside chief executive Kai-Fu Leeâs 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach â which is designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies. Because DeepSeekâs models are more affordable, it has played a role in helping to drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that has seen successive waves of price cuts over the past 1Â½ years. DeepSeekâs success may push OpenAI and US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft â each of which has committed to capital expenditure of US$65 billion (S$87.7 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â if more efficient models can also compete with a much smaller outlay.Â That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies like Nvidia and ASML Holding that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeekâs software to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models â while potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeekâs advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed.Â Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeekâs cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. It also briefly experienced a major outage on Jan 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.Â BLOOMBERG JoinÂ ST's Telegram channelÂ and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Title: Nvidia sheds $792 billion of market value in DeepSeek rout, biggest one-day loss in US history

NEW YORK - Nvidiaâs share plunge, fuelled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the worldâs largest company.Â Nvidiaâs shares tumbled 17 per cent on Jan 27, erasing US$589 billion (S$792 billion) from the companyâs market capitalisation. That eclipsed the previous record â a 9 per cent drop in September that wiped out about US$279 billion in value â and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Jan 27âs slump, Nvidia sell-offs have caused eight of the top 10 biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Jan 27 and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The semiconductor maker led a broader sell-off in technology stocks after DeepSeekâs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing AI. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price.Â The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of ChatGPTâs OpenAI and Facebookâs Meta Platforms. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Appleâs App Store rankings. Â âConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,â Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because it designs semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that are not showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Jan 24 to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as US$65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group and Oracle announcing a US$100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centres and AI infrastructure projects around the United States. In a bid to stall Chinaâs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement on Jan 27 that DeepSeekâs model is an âexcellent AI advancementâ and indicated that the Chinese company did not violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, ârequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networkingâ.

Title: Deepseek Announcement Sinks The American Tech Market

Horizontal color image of a data center from a drone point of view. Amid a free-ranging route of U.S. tech stocks, investors are wondering how the new announcement from Chinese firm DeepSeek, of a new efficient reasoning model to be reckoned with, is going to affect the industry long-term. It’s not just investors, either – the big question for many people looking at the global race for AI is whether DeepSeek’s result really will deliver a great reasoning model for a lot lower cost than its American competitors. In the past few cycles, the world saw double-digit losses for Nvidia, and other negative action, like Palantir dipping 6%, that’s making the bulls nervous. We’ve even seen other kinds of U.S. stocks like nuclear stocks tanking on the premise that America might be spending less on dominating AI and data center markets in the future. "DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less," said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, as reported by Aimee Picchi at CBS News. "This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years." But it’s worth thinking a little more long-term about this, since we’re likely to have a pretty big global market for AI in the years to come. People are referring to the DeepSeek announcement as America’s “Sputnik moment” for the AI age, when U.S. parties had a right to be spooked. However, others are asking whether the proof is in the pudding, and whether DeepSeek really does have an advanced edge over the American systems. A team of writers at Bloomberg reported: “(Some) investors, like Fares Hendi at French asset manager Prevoir AM, say they’re holding onto their Nvidia shares and waiting for more information about DeepSeek’s technological promise.” “If they really need less chips to make their model run, then yes the threat is real, it would weigh on growth and valuation,” Hendi said, as reported in Bloomberg. “But at the moment, we’re going to take the time to really look into it.” Then, too, some who were quoted suggested the news might be good for AI, in the long-term and from a big-picture perspective: “It would seem to me that if you still believe that AI is going to be big, this news out of China should only make you feel better… and perhaps present you with some buying opportunities,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be bumps or risks (as price seeking continues). But it should be clear that there are some stocks that will be down this morning for the wrong reasons.” Financial pros weighed in on the phenomenon, too. “It’s safe to say that anything US-AI related was very crowded and anything tech-related in China was very under owned,” explains Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “So you are going to see a bit of a unwind of those two different crowded sides. It’ll be interesting to see if the options market picks some winners and losers.” Over the past few years, we’ve seen OpenAI and Anthropic and others continue to develop advanced reasoning systems in a way that suggested America was going to be king of the AI world for the duration. But people close to the industry knew that China had its own research teams and systems that were likely to give other nations a run for their money. Time will tell how much fire power DeepSeek has and whether it will continue to depress the American technology sector in the stock market. Another argument emerges that China and the U.S. can both reign supreme in their own hemispheres, in terms of AI systems. Some of the above quotes hint at that, too. Of course, there’s always going to be one particular model that’s better than any others, but there’s also room for customization and specialization in these systems. It’s one thing to concede that stocks like Nvidia, which had wildly spiraled up based on U.S. dominance predictions, is going to keep its high valuation, but it’s another thing to wonder whether China will have an outside influence on American AI systems. Like anything related to the lightning-speed transformation of LLMs in business, the U.S./China divide is going to take some time to figure out. When the dust clears, what will we see? One Community.

Title: OpenAI's Sam Altman, who once warned America about Trump, is now partnering with him

Time Published: 2025-01-27T21:34:09Z
Full Content:
"Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America," Altman wrote in 2016. The day after President Donald Trump returned to office, Sam Altman, the CEO of tech giant OpenAI, stood behind the presidential seal at the White House and praised the newly sworn-in president for the $500 billion "Stargate" initiative he was joining to build an artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. Altman said it wouldn't have been possible without Trump. "For AGI [artificial general intelligence] to get built here, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to create a new industry centered here, we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President, and I'm thrilled that we get to," Altman said as he and other industry leaders smiled for photos in the Roosevelt Room. The chummy announcement represented a stark reversal for Altman, who -- in the early days of Trump's first term -- emerged as one of Silicon Valley's first and most vocal critics of the president. From 2016 through 2022, Altman repeatedly warned about what he saw as the dangers posed by Trump's leadership and his policies. During the 2016 campaign, he compared Trump to Hitler in 1930s Germany, and he called on other tech companies to stand against Trump in the early days of the new administration. He donated hundreds of thousands to Democratic causes and candidates, including $200,000 to help reelect President Joe Biden in 2024. After Trump announced the "Stargate" deal, the OpenAI CEO appeared to address his reversal in a post on X, writing that "watching [Trump] more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him," and adding, "I'm not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!" Other tech leaders have shifted their stance on Trump in recent years, even more so since his 2024 election win. Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced the end of its fact-checking program and eased restrictions on discussions about topics such as immigration and gender identity, following longstanding criticism from President Trump and his allies. Altman's public opposition to Trump began during the 2016 presidential campaign when, in October of that year, Altman made his first-ever presidential endorsement by backing Hillary Clinton. "I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional," Altman wrote in a blog post on Oct. 16, 2016, titled "The 2016 Election." "Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it," Altman wrote. Months earlier, in the heat of the presidential campaign, Altman had published a scathing critique of Trump, writing, "He is irresponsible in the way dictators are." "To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it's chilling to watch Trump in action," Altman wrote in June 2016. "Though I know intellectually it's easy in hard economic times to rile people up with a hatred of outsiders, it's still surprising to watch this happen right in front of us." "Hitler taught us about the Big Lie -- the lie so big, and so often repeated, that people end up believing it," Altman wrote. "Trump's Big Lie is hiding in plain sight. His Big Lie is that he's going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders." After Trump's victory, Altman called on his fellow tech leaders to "take a stand" against the new Trump administration in the wake of Trump's executive order known as the so-called Muslim ban, which Trump called "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States." Altman called the 2017 order "a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation." The order spurred nationwide protests and legal challenges before being modified and then overturned by President Biden in 2021. He urged the tech industry to take action, writing on his personal blog, "The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally." He added that employees at tech companies "should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take." "It would be particularly embarrassing for us to fall for this -- we are a nation of immigrants, and we know that immigrants built this country (and Trump, of course, is the grandson of immigrants and married to an immigrant)," Altman wrote. Altman himself took action by launching a website called "Track Trump," which monitored Trump's fulfillment of his 2016 campaign promises over his first 100 days in office. He shared the website in a February 2017 tweet in which he said, "For all the noise, Trump hasn't actually done very much yet." Altman's public criticism continued throughout Trump's first presidency. In a March 2017 tweet, Altman posted, "I think Trump is terrible and few things would make me happier than him not being president." "If you elect a reality TV star as President, you can't be surprised when you get a reality TV show," Altman wrote in July 2017. At a "Talks with Google" event in October 2017, Altman defended his outspoken criticism of Trump. Acknowledging that "if you "piss off the president, he might do bad things to you," Altman nevertheless said that "when the future of the republic is at risk, the duty to the country and our values transcends the duty to your particular company and your stock price." "I think I started that a little bit earlier than other people, but at this point I am in really good company," Altman added. Later, in the wake of Trump's 2020 election loss, Altman praised LinkedIn chairman and Democratic supporter Reid Hoffman, writing on Twitter, "Very few people realize just how much @reidhoffman did and spent to stop Trump from getting re-elected -- it seems reasonably likely to me that Trump would still be in office without his efforts. Thank you, Reid!" In recent years, Altman has himself contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, including giving $200,000 in 2023 to the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising committee that sought to reelect Joe Biden in 2024, according to federal election commission records reviewed by ABC News. Early in the 2020 election cycle, he contributed to a slew of Democratic primary presidential contenders, including to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, then-Sen. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, then later gave $100,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign. He also gave $100,000 each to the pro-Democratic super PACs American Bridge PAC and Senate Majority PAC. He wasn't an active political contributor during the 2016 election cycle, but gave a total of $1,500 to the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012. Although Altman has almost exclusively donated to Democrats, he has also donated to a handful of Republicans, including California Reps. Darrell Issa and Jay Obernolte, Rep. John Curtis of Utah, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Then, after Trump was reelected this past November, Altman was among the first corporate executives to publicly announce their donation to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, as tech companies including Meta and Amazon lined up to financially support Trump's inauguration. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to ABC News that Altman donated $1 million to the inaugural committee in December. Last Monday, Altman was among the select number of tech executives spotted attending Trump's swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol rotunda. "President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead," Altman wrote in a statement to ABC News at the time about his inauguration contribution. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: DeepSeek Damage: Google, Microsoft Take Stock Hit on AI Fears

The emergence of the Chinese AI model spurred a Wall Street selloff of some of the biggest names in tech on Monday DeepSeek, the hottest name in artificial intelligence, took a Chinese hammer to several tech companies on Monday, with Microsoft, Google and especially Nvidia seeing their stock prices take a noticeable hit. If you missed it, DeepSeek climbed to the top of Apple’s App Store this weekend — surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT — after releasing its R1 and R1-Zero models. DeepSeek, founded by Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, quickly shook up the tech world — which you can read more about by clicking here — and spurred a Wall Street sell-off for several AI-focused companies, such as: — Microsoft, OpenAI’s chief partner, dropped 2.14% — Alphabet, Google’s parent company that has its own AI model, Gemini, dropped 4% — Tesla, which uses AI for its FSD (full self-driving) technology, declined 2.32% — Nvidia, which makes GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and chips that are the backbone of many AI applications, saw its stock price crater 16.86%. The Santa Clara-based company was the world’s most valuable company last Thursday, but has since dipped to third place, behind Apple and Microsoft, with a $2.9 trillion market cap when market’s closed on Monday. Notably, Meta — the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — avoided the dip; Meta’s stock price increased 2.2% on Monday. Like DeepSeek — and unlike ChatGPT and Gemini — the company’s Llama AI model is open-source. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced last Friday the company would be spending $60 billion-$65 billion this year to enhance its AI efforts. The sell-off is likely due to fears that China has caught, or even surpassed, America in the AI arms race (remember, China’s communist government is closely tied to every one of the country’s tech companies, including ByteDance, TikTok’s parent). On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.46% and the Nasdaq 3.07%. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, even called DeepSeek AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. However, Wedbush managing director Dan Ives, during an interview with CNBC on Monday afternoon, said he does not view DeepSeek’s emergence as a death sentence for the established American players in AI. “In my view, it’s a top three buying opportunity that I’ve seen in the last decade for tech,” Ives said. “I think the Street and the market got this way wrong. In no way does this dent our bull thesis.”

Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has rocked the US stock market after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence models that offer comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is only a year old but it’s quickly become the No.1 app in the Australian app store, and its emergence may offer a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled overnight as hype around DeepSeek’s innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and their hardware suppliers. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response.Credit: Bloomberg Shares in AI giant Nvidia tanked 17 per cent and the company lost a record $US589 billion ($936 billion) in market capitalisation; the net worth of its CEO and largest shareholder Jensen Huang fell by some $US20 billion in mere hours. Shares in Oracle also plummeted. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops open-source AI models, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted the licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it. Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek’s models appears to be only a fraction of what’s required for OpenAI or Meta’s best products. The much better efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That also amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China – which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies such as GPU semiconductors to China in a bid to stall the country’s advances in AI – the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company’s demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions were not entirely effective in stymieing China’s progress. Tech stocks plunged on Wall Street on Monday, led by AI darling Nvidia. Credit: Bloomberg The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. In November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January rocketed to global renown as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative. Investor Marc Andreessen called it “AI’s Sputnik moment”. The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by January 25 and ranked No.1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Liang received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with 10 million yuan ($2.2 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36Kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,” Liang said. China’s technology leaders, from Alibaba and Baidu to Tencent, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s latest release AI’s “Sputnik moment”. Credit: Bloomberg Alongside Kai-Fu Lee’s 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach – designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek’s models are more affordable, it’s already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that’s seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. One of Donald Trump’s first announcements since retaking the US presidency was Stargate, a new ambitious joint venture designed to unlock up to $US500 billion in private sector investment to fund AI infrastructure, create more than 100,000 jobs, and help the US stay ahead of the likes of China. DeepSeek’s rapid ascent will add a deeper sense of urgency to what was already a fast-moving collaborative effort. “What we want to do is we want to keep it [AI] in this country. China is a competitor; others are competitors. We want to be in this country, and we’re making it available,” Trump said at a press conference at the White House. “I’m gonna help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency; we have to get this stuff built. So they have to produce a lot of electricity. And we’ll make it possible for them to get this production done easily, at their own plants, if they want.” DeepSeek’s success may push OpenAI and other US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It also calls into question the vast spending by companies such as Meta and Microsoft – each of which has committed to capex of $US65 billion ($103 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure – if more efficient models can compete with a much smaller outlay. That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies such as Nvidia and ASML that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeek’s software and looking to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models — while also potentially touching off additional concerns about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeek’s advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed. Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures such as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. The company briefly experienced a major outage on January 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot. It said it was hit by a cyberattack on Monday that disrupted users’ ability to register on the site. The company, whose artificial intelligence chatbot has sent the tech world into a frenzy, said that it had suffered “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding Budapest Mayor Aims to Block Orban’s Plans to Build ‘Mini Dubai’ NYC Subway’s Most Dangerous Stations Are on Lexington Ave. Line Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%. The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. All About DeepSeek and Its Lower-Cost AI Model: QuickTake The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. “Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.” --With assistance from Philip Sanders and Cagan Koc.

The chipmaker's stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia's worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After Nvidia surpassed Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, the stock's drop Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The sell-off was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. In late December, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s. Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants such as Alphabet, Meta and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report Monday that the release of DeepSeek's latest technology has caused "great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs." The analysts said they "think this view is farthest from the truth" and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to "the AI industry wanting more compute, not less." They recommend buying Nvidia shares. But after Nvidia's huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% in 2024 — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion. Data center companies reliant on Nvidia's GPUs for their hardware sales saw big sell-offs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump's latest AI initiative, fell 14%. For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta's $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020. Nvidia's decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix. CEO Jensen Huang's net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list. The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple's app store. The model's development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China. Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House's AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek's model "shows that the AI race will be very competitive" and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden's executive order last week on AI safety. "I'm confident in the U.S. but we can't be complacent," Sacks wrote. Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

Title: Apple is well-positioned as DeepSeek threatens AI giants, analysts say

Big Tech is reeling from the seemingly sudden popularity of a big new Chinese AI name, but Apple could benefit from a disruption to its competitors' efforts. DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, released the AI model R1 on January 20. Many in the tech industry believe DeepSeek's large language models could threaten some of the biggest AI players, including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. DeepSeek has spooked markets because it appears to deliver models that are as effective as US versions but much cheaper to produce because they run on less powerful chips. That undercuts Google, OpenAI, and others' ability to charge premium prices to access the best of their AI models. The Netherlands-based chipmaker ASML's shares fell by 7%, while the AI chip giant Nvidia's stock dropped by more than 17% on Monday. Apple, however, is in a relatively good position, tech analysts told Business Insider. Its stock rose on Monday, while competitors Alphabet and Microsoft traded down. "Apple would be a beneficiary if the cost of AI training declined," Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said. One reason Apple stands to gain from cheaper AI training is that it "rightly focuses on how to integrate AI as a product, rather than building the most cutting-edge models," William Kerwin, a tech analyst at Morningstar, said. Apple could integrate LLMs and improve Apple Intelligence at a cheaper rate than competitors and ultimately keep costs down for consumers, Kerwin said. If DeepSeek proves that powerful AI capabilities are achievable for a fraction of what most AI companies are spending, it could "benefit Apple by leveling the playing field and allowing it to accelerate AI integration plans without making excessive capital expenditures," Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI's sister company EMARKETER, said. Apple has been criticized for being slow to put out its AI offerings. It released Apple Intelligence software last year, months after its Big Tech competitors launched their versions and years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT. By spending less on AI infrastructure, Bourne said, Apple has some insulation from the fallout its US competitors are facing. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Tech leaders like Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg have maintained that investing heavily in AI is worth the risk — Meta is expected to invest over $60 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Apple's AI spending appears to be lower than that. Although the iPhone maker hasn't disclosed exactly what it spent on AI in 2024, it reported $45.6 billion in payments for property, plant, and equipment in the fiscal year — up from $43.7 billion in 2023. Those costs would likely include more than just AI spending. Jump to

"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling," an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. "DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant." The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1's self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial intelligence models. Nvidia's statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek's breakthrough as creating more work for the American chipmaker's graphics processing units, or GPUs. "Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking," the spokesperson added. "We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling." Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang's comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia's GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multibillion-dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as part of its AI strategy. "If model training costs prove to be significantly lower, we would expect a near-term cost benefit for advertising, travel, and other consumer app companies that use cloud AI services, while long-term hyperscaler AI-related revenues and costs would likely be lower," wrote BofA Securities analyst Justin Post in a note Monday. Nvidia's comment also reflects a new theme that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have discussed in recent months. Much of the AI boom and the demand for Nvidia GPUs was driven by the "scaling law," a concept in AI development proposed by OpenAI researchers in 2020. That concept suggested that better AI systems could be developed by greatly expanding the amount of computation and data that went into building a new model, requiring more and more chips. Since November, Huang and Altman have been focusing on a new wrinkle to the scaling law, which Huang calls "test-time scaling." This concept says that if a fully trained AI model spends more time using extra computer power when making predictions or generating text or images to allow it to "reason," it will provided better answers than it would have if it ran for less time. Forms of the test-time scaling law are used in some of OpenAI's models such as o1 as well as DeepSeek's breakthrough R1 model.

Title: DeepSeek: all the news about the startup that’s shaking up AI stocks

Time Published: 2025-01-27T20:20:05Z

by Verge Staff DeepSeek is shaking up the AI industry with cost-efficient large language models it claims can perform just as well as rivals from giants like OpenAI and Meta. The Chinese startup says its flagship R1 reasoning model is capable of achieving “performance comparable” to OpenAI’s o1 equivalent, while the newly released Janus Pro multimodal AI model can supposedly outperform Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3. DeepSeek’s ChatGPT competitor quickly soared to the top of the App Store, and the company is disrupting financial markets, with shares of Nvidia dipping 17 percent to cut nearly $600 billion from its market cap on January 27th, which CNBC said is the biggest single-day drop in US history. The AI assistant is powered by the startup’s “state-of-the-art” DeepSeek-V3 model, allowing users to ask questions, plan trips, generate text, and more. As downloads of DeepSeek’s app spiked, the startup began restricting signups due to “malicious attacks.” Launched in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek has garnered attention for building open-source AI models using less cash and fewer GPUs when compared to the billions spent by OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others. If DeepSeek’s performance claims are true, it could prove that the startup managed to build powerful AI models despite strict US export controls preventing chipmakers like Nvidia from selling high-performance graphics cards in China. Here’s all the latest on DeepSeek. Kylie Robison and Elizabeth Lopatto It took about a month for the finance world to start freaking out about DeepSeek, but when it did, it took more than half a trillion dollars — or one entire Stargate — off Nvidia’s market cap. It wasn’t just Nvidia, either: Tesla, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft tanked. DeepSeek’s two AI models, released in quick succession, put it on par with the best available from American labs, according to Alexandr Wang, Scale AI CEO. And DeepSeek seems to be working within constraints that mean it trained much more cheaply than its American peers. One of its recent models is said to cost just $5.6 million in the final training run, which is about the salary an American AI expert can command. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the cost of training models ranged from $100 million to $1 billion. OpenAI’s GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, according to CEO Sam Altman. DeepSeek seems to have just upended our idea of how much AI costs, with potentially enormous implications across the industry. Richard Lawler Now that a Chinese startup has captured a lot of the AI buzz, what happens next? The ChatGPT boss says of his company, “we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor,” then, naturally, turns the conversation to AGI. Richard Lawler Without going into detail about what might happen to the $52 billion in subsidies from the CHIPS Act under his administration, Donald Trump said tariffs on foreign computer chips, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals are coming “in the near future.” He also namechecked DeepSeek’s AI releases, saying, “...coming up with a faster method of AI and less expensive, that’s good. I view that as a positive if it is fact and it is true, and nobody knows, but I view that as a positive.” In the speech at the House GOP Issues Conference held at the Trump National Doral Resort in Miami Monday afternoon, he said that to return the production of these goods to the US, “we don’t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program Biden has.” Instead the incentive for manufacturers will be “they will not want to pay a tax.” Richard Lawler As Chinese AI startup DeepSeek draws attention for open-source AI models that it says are cheaper than the competition while providing similar or better performance, AI chip king Nvidia’s stock price dropped today. CNBC said that after closing at $118.58, down 17 percent, this was “the biggest drop ever for a U.S. company.” Emma Roth In a statement to Bloomberg, an Nvidia spokesperson said DeepSeek is an “excellent AI advancement” and shows how a company can create new AI models using the test-time scaling method, while “leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” [Bloomberg] Richard Lawler Already riding a wave of hype over its R1 “reasoning” AI that is atop the app store charts and shifting the stock market, Chinese startup DeepSeek has released another new open-source AI model: Janus-Pro. Input image analysis is limited to 384x384 resolution, but the company says the largest version, Janus-Pro-7b, beat comparable models on two AI benchmark tests. Correction: As TechCrunch notes, Janus-Pro image input is listed as limited to low resolution, not its output. Jess Weatherbed After surging to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in the US, DeepSeek’s AI Assistant is now restricting new user sign-ups. According to an incident report page, registrations are being temporarily limited “due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek’s services,” though it’s unclear how these limitations are being applied. “Existing users can log in as usual,” DeepSeek said in its update. “Thanks for your understanding and support.” An alert banner on the DeepSeek web sign-up page says that “registration may be busy,” rather than entirely restricted, however, and encourages users to wait and “try again” if their application is unsuccessful. Jess Weatherbed A chatbot made by Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has rocketed to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in the US this week, dethroning OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app. The eponymous AI assistant is powered by DeepSeek’s open-source models, which the company says can be trained at a fraction of the cost using far fewer chips than the world’s leading models. The claim has riled financial markets, with Nvidia’s share price dropping over 12 percent in pre-market trading. Downloads for the app exploded shortly after DeepSeek released its new R1 reasoning model on January 20th, which is designed for solving complex problems and reportedly performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 on certain benchmarks.

Rich James Jan 28, 2025 Leaders from around the world have joined with Auschwitz survivors to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Germany death camp. Reuters says the ceremony has been seen as “one of the last such gatherings of those who experienced its horrors”. 86-year-old Tova Friedman, who was six when she was among the 7,000 people liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945, told the Associated Press she also believed it would be the last gathering of Auschwitz survivors. Having travelled from her home in New Jersey to Poland this week, she told the newswire: “The world has become toxic. I realise that we’re in a crisis again, that there is so much hatred around, so much distrust, that if we don’t stop, it may get worse and worse. There may be another terrible destruction.” The BBC reports the ceremony included “graphic accounts of what the survivors endured, followed by appeals for tolerance and combating antisemitism”. The broadcaster said German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, French President Emmanuel Macron and King Charles III “made passionate statements” but “the words echoing in the shadow of Birkenau’s Death Gate belong to the dwindling number of survivors”. The ceremony ended with survivors and world leaders lighting candles at the empty wooden train car, which sits on the tracks at Auschwitz. Yesterday Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a Holocaust memorial service at JHUB Maccabi Community Centre in Perth and pledged $4.4 million to build a national Holocaust education centre in Canberra, as well as $2 million to upgrade the Holocaust Education Centre in Western Australia. The PM said in a statement: “On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we hold on to the memories of millions. We reflect on the great multitude of Jewish life that the Holocaust robbed from the world — all of that energy, potential, inspiration, talent and love — and we hold their names and their faces in our hearts. We tend to these memories because we cannot allow the Holocaust to recede into history. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow.” The ABC reported ahead of the ceremony that Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong, who was at the Auschwitz ceremony, said: “We are here to say, never again. I would say at this time, we have to stand together across beliefs, across political difference, across politics, we have to stand against prejudice and hate and antisemitism in all its forms. When we say never again we have to not only mean it, but bring that to what we do as political leaders.” Guardian Australia and many others picked up Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is also in Poland, responding to a question about Opposition Leader Peter Dutton’s criticism of Wong attending the ceremony. Dreyfus said it was “grotesque to see attempts being made to politicise either commemoration of the Holocaust or combating antisemitism. We need to get politics out of this.” Dutton said in a statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day: “Today we remember the six million Jews whose lives were exterminated by the Nazis in an act so calculated and cruel it constitutes one of the most monstrous crimes in human history.” He added: “In the magnitude of antisemitism which is plaguing Western democracies today — including Australia — many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils.” The Coalition leader said if elected his government would aim for every schoolchild to visit a Holocaust museum as well as provide “$19 million to Australian Holocaust museums to support their expansion and to commemorate the victims of Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023”. The ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is now in its second week and Monday saw hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes — or the ruins where their homes once stood — in northern Gaza, the BBC reports. The Guardian says thousands crossed the border on Monday morning after Israel “opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year”. The AFP news agency reports a Gaza security official claimed “more than 200,000 displaced people have returned to Gaza and North Gaza” in the first two hours of Monday. The newswire also reports the Israeli government has said eight of the hostages held in Gaza due for release in the first phase of the ceasefire deal are dead. So, hands up if you’ve heard of the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek? You certainly will have by the end of this morning. The low-cost app has caused all kinds of havoc on Wall Street in recent hours, with shares in major US technology firms falling steeply in value after the sudden emergence of DeepSeek. The BBC says the app, which was launched last week, has overtaken rivals including ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app in the US. The initial impact on the markets made headlines around the world as “investors made a quick exit from several big-name tech stocks”, as the British broadcaster puts it. For example, AI chip maker Nvidia saw its share price drop 16%, wiping $500 billion off its value, on Monday. CNN says DeepSeek’s “surprise advancement” has “threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry”. (You’ll remember US President Donald Trump announced to much fanfare his $500 billion Stargate AI project last Tuesday, the day before DeepSeek released its open-source model.) The US broadcaster provides a handy summary of why DeepSeek has caused such a scene: “DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies,” CNN said. WIRED also also a very handy explainer here. Many publications have picked up on tech investor Marc Andreessen declaring on X: “Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen.” Fortune highlights Andreessen also said: “DeepSeek-R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment”. Meanwhile, WIRED also reports the company said on Monday it was temporarily limiting new sign-ups due to “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services. As the market continues to watch what is happening to US tech stock, domestically all eyes are set to be on the December quarter inflation rate when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases the data at 11.30am AEDT tomorrow. The ABC states the “nation’s economists, bankers and mortgagees [will be] clustered, agog, around their screens” for the figures. The broadcaster has an interesting analysis piece on why it’s not as simple as, “if the Wednesday figures are low the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next month”. You can read it here. It won’t just be the economists and market traders gathered around their screens for the inflation stats, you can be sure politicians will be as well, ready to spin the results in the direction they need. Talking of waiting for something to happen. Does anyone know when Trump is going to get around to ringing Albanese in an official capacity now he’s US president? The 78-year-old is certainly making his way down the list of other world leaders… Another day, another headline for Elon Musk. But this one is a bit different to the rest. USA Today reports that on January 2 the Minor Planet Center announced the discovery of a new asteroid, complete with an official name: 2018 CN41. Unfortunately, less than 17 hours later the asteroid was deleted from the organisation’s record and an editorial note issued stating “it was pointed out the orbit matches an artificial object 2018-017A, Falcon Heavy Upper stage with the Tesla roadster”. That’s right, the object was not an asteroid, it was in fact the Tesla car Musk blasted into space on a Space X Falcon rocket in 2018. Astronomy reports the asteroid/car had first been “identified” and submitted by a citizen scientist. The site adds: “The case of mistaken identity was resolved swiftly in a collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers. But some astronomers say it is also emblematic of a growing issue: the lack of transparency from nations and companies operating craft in deep space, beyond the orbits used by most satellites.” (While we’re here, please feel free to keep sending me feedback, things you’d like to see more/less of in the Worm and any tips you may have to worm@crikey.com.au.) I want debate to be respectful… and that’s a choice that she made. People are allowed to express themselves, but I thought it was disrespectful of the event and of the people who that event was primarily for. Anthony Albanese The prime minister was yesterday asked about former Australian of the Year Grace Tame wearing a T-shirt with “Fuck Murdoch” written on its front during a reception at The Lodge at the weekend. Asked if he agreed with the t-shirt’s sentiment, Albanese said: “I clearly disagree.” Tame meanwhile declared: “It’s a great shirt and says it all, doesn’t it?” Changing the date alone will not erase the scars of colonisation, but it is a powerful gesture of Australia’s willingness to listen, learn, and take action towards reconciliation. It is a call for all Australians to walk together on a path of truth-telling and healing. Only then can we move to honour the past. Let’s create celebrations that unite, rather than exclude people; celebrations where everyone can feel welcome, whether their family has called Australia home for five years or 50,000 years. By shifting the focus of Australia Day, we can create a nation that celebrates not just its achievements but its capacity for growth and understanding. January 26 may always carry its historical weight, but our future as a unified nation requires that we honour it with the respect and reflection it deserves — by changing the date we celebrate. Managing but not governing. In charge but not in power. Deciding but not leading. That was the prime minister on display at Friday’s National Press Club address — unveiling another managerial tweak to the economy, denouncing his opponent, and promising voters more of the same that they’ve been given over the past two-and-a-half years. Business as usual isn’t going to cut it. The drift in Labor’s support has been happening for 18 months, to the point where it’s impossible to see the government retaining its majority. But there are weeks, and likely months, until the election. Don’t think that drift can’t continue to the point where a Dutton government, even a majority government, becomes odds-on. Peter Dutton leads a pack of duds, and his policies — where he has them — are an embarrassing confection of innumeracy and MAGA Down Under cut-and-pastes. Labor should be setting itself up for an extended period in government. Instead, Anthony Albanese is quietly leading it to defeat. Since last year’s council nomination fiasco, the NSW Liberal division has been under federal takeover, a move aimed at ensuring candidate selection for the upcoming federal election goes smoothly. But with a handful of Sydney seats still without candidates, some in the party worry the takeover committee hasn’t solved the party’s admin challenges. “The impression is that everything was going to be fixed by [the federal takeover] — but are we any better off than we were a year ago?” a Liberal source told Crikey. The NSW seats where the Liberals lack candidates are the Western Sydney electorates of Blaxland, Chifley, McMahon, Watson and Fowler, as well as the inner-city seat of Sydney.

Well, maybe not (The New York Times) ($) Hegseth, Trump’s Pentagon ‘disrupter,’ vows swift action (The Washington Post) New Zealand eases visa rules for ‘digital nomads’ to boost tourism (BBC) Neale Daniher’s worthy recognition is a unique opportunity to change the conversation about the NDIS — George Taleporos (Guardian Australia): What I hope will come from Daniher’s recognition goes beyond this. I hope to see a shift in the national dialogue around the NDIS. The NDIS is a lifeline for countless Australians such as Daniher, living with complex disabilities, providing the means for us to live with dignity, independence and control over our lives. Whether it’s through funding for personal care, wheelchairs, therapies, or other supports, the NDIS empowers individuals to live as active members of society. Yet, despite its transformative impact, the national dialogue around the NDIS has become alarmingly negative. Media headlines are dominated by stories of cost blowouts, fraud and inefficiencies, overshadowing the real stories of lives changed and opportunities created. This persistent focus on the scheme’s financial cost has contributed to a public discourse that too often portrays people with disabilities as financial burdens and the NDIS as an unnecessary and out-of-control strain on taxpayers and our economy. Australia must face down US tech bosses and Trump – Paul Smith (AFR): Regardless of whether you agree with the media bargaining or social media age limit policies, scrapping them to pre-emptively appease Trump would be a horrible show of weakness. If a foreign country (and supposed ally) wants to make it uneconomical for Australians to live there, then perhaps it is no longer a country they should be living in. If a policy of going hard to hold tech companies like Meta and Google to account was right when Joe Biden was president — and both sides of Australian politics thought it was — then it is still right today.

Title: DeepSeek displaces ChatGPT as the App Store’s top app

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The mobile app for DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, skyrocketed to the No. 1 spot in app stores around the globe this weekend, topping the U.S.-based AI chatbot, ChatGPT. On iOS, DeepSeek is currently the No. 1 free app in the U.S. App Store and 51 other countries, according to mobile app analytics firm Appfigures. The rapid rise of DeepSeek in the app stores’ Top Charts follows its meteoric rise in popularity this week resulting from the release of a series of open AI models that are competitive with leading offerings from OpenAI and Google. However, compared to other frontier AI models, DeepSeek claims its models were trained for just a fraction of the price with significantly worse AI chips. This represents new efficiency gains for AI model training, which sent Nvidia’s stock price tumbling down as much as 17% on Monday and has put the rest of the tech industry on high alert. On Friday, DeepSeek’s mobile app had just a million downloads across both the App Store and Google Play. That number has since doubled as of Monday morning, to 2.6 million downloads of DeepSeek’s mobile app across both platforms. The app currently sits in the Top 10 list for free apps in 111 countries on the App Store and in 18 countries on Google Play, according to Appfigures. In addition, more than 80% of DeepSeek’s total mobile app downloads have come in the past seven days, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. In that time frame, DeepSeek saw nearly 300% more app downloads than Perplexity, another leading consumer AI app. DeepSeek moved into its No. 1 spot on the U.S. App Store on Sunday, January 26, up from No. 31 just a couple days prior. Meanwhile, DeepSeek is the No. 14 Overall free app on Google Play, rapidly climbing up from No. 133 on January 24. As a result, daily active users jumped both globally and in the U.S. by over 110% from January 24 to 25 compared with the same period last week. While China is the largest mobile app market for DeepSeek today, it represents only 23% of its total downloads, according to Sensor Tower. The app’s second and third largest markets are the United States, which makes up 15% of its total downloads, and Egypt, which makes up 6% of its total downloads. The popularity of DeepSeek’s mobile app raises questions about the moat of popular consumer AI apps, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. While hundreds of millions of people use ChatGPT and Gemini every month, DeepSeek proves that the consumer AI space is still volatile, and new competitors shouldn’t be counted out. However, it’s worth noting that reaching the No. 1 position on the App Store isn’t just calculated by app downloads alone. Apple’s algorithm, though secretive, is a combination of numerous factors, including velocity of the installs and more. That allows apps that gain installs quickly to skyrocket to the top of the charts, overtaking others that may have a larger total number of users or installs. It will be more telling to see how long DeepSeek holds its top position over time. The tech industry is still coming to terms with the techniques DeepSeek used to train its AI models, and what it means for the broader AI space. In light of DeepSeek’s R1 model, leading AI model providers may be feeling pressured to release better models to prove their dominance, or justify the hefty price they’re paying for compute. Meta has reportedly created several “war rooms” to analyze DeepSeek’s training methods. DeepSeek’s rise in popularity was potentially stifled by “large-scale malicious” attacks, the company reported on Monday, which forced it to limit customers outside of China from registering for the app. Additional reporting by Sarah Perez.

Title: 2:00PM Water Cooler 1/27/2025

Bird Song of the Day Brown Thrasher, Elkinsville Rd. and Kirk’s Ford Rd., Brown, Indiana, United States. Grab a cup of coffee for nineteen minutes of thrashing! * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” [Axios]. “President Trump is surprising — even frustrating — some longtime friends in his second administration’s early days with fewer leaks, a lack of exploitable rivalries, and tighter restrictions on access to him. Why it matters: No modern president has done more — across more areas of American policy, culture and life — than Trump in the past six days. This new operating style and system enabled a strategy of flooding the nation with so many huge moves that it’s hard for critics to attack specific ones.” And: “It’s stunning to veterans of Trump’s first West Wing. But at least in Week 1, the new government has mirrored the discipline of his 2024 campaign operation — another sharp contrast with his previous teams…. There’s a ‘strong silo system’ that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added.” Interestingly: “The biggest change of all, Axios has learned, is that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and other aides have clamped down on the ability of random friends and reporters to call Trump directly. Until now, if you had his phone number and called, Trump would answer and talk to you — and maybe even act on whatever you suggested. Now, Trump wants to focus more on work and has less time for bull sessions so he’s less prone to answer his phone.” • Of course, some might suggest that we want Trump to “work” as little possible. “Confident, organised, still freewheeling: Trump 2.0 has learned from past” [BBC]. “The stacks of leather-bound executive orders piled high on the Resolute Desk illustrate how the Trump 2.0 era is set against a different political landscape from four years ago – one which has produced a more emboldened commander-in-chief…. ‘It’s been much more disciplined, on-point and issue-focused,’ said Lawrence Muir, a former official in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr Muir, who was tasked with hiring administration personnel as part of the 2016 Trump transition team, told the BBC his work was ‘essentially discarded’ by the incoming White House at the time. ‘They did not have a great idea about what they were supposed to be producing, or how to produce it,’ he said. ‘[Trump’s] doing much better this time in terms of what he’s getting out, getting it out efficiently, and knowing how it has to be enforced down through the agencies.'” * * * “Trump’s agenda is about to hit a make-or-break moment” [Politico]. “House Republicans are heading to President Donald Trump’s Miami-area resort for their annual policy retreat…. The biggest task for the gathering at Trump National Doral: Finalize a budget blueprint plan for the massive, party-line bill they’re planning, touching energy, border security and tax policy. But to do that, Republicans need to decide what will go in that package — with the price tag of Trump’s priorities reaching $10 trillion over 10 years — versus what might be included in a separate, bipartisan government funding bill that will be negotiated with Democrats over the next seven weeks. The fate of a necessary debt ceiling increase is top of mind…. The planned retreat discussions have been tailored to show attending members the possibilities for the way forward and to take their temperatures on potential spending cuts, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the planning. Leaders will have to carefully balance sometimes competing interests from various GOP factions.” And: “Centrists are also relaying their concerns to GOP leaders about some committees’ plans to target pieces of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food aid benefits for more than 40 million low-income Americans…. Those proposals are relatively more palatable for GOP lawmakers in competitive districts than the massive cuts to current benefits some conservatives would prefer. But they’re still politically divisive and could provide Democrats major campaign fodder in blue and purple districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.” • But cutting Medicaid, though easy and fun, won’t get those trillions. It never does. * * * “Trump actions could wreak havoc on South Florida’s sizeable Colombian population” [Miami Herald]. “Florida is home to 473,606 Colombians, according to the U.S. Census data. The state has long been a magnet for new arrivals from the South American country who are seeking a place where there are many Spanish speakers, a warm climate and a ready-made community.” • Interestingly, the story doesn’t sat what percentage of those new arrivals have their papers in order. “Trump wants to tackle inflation. Will these top actions bring prices down?” [WaPo]. The deck: “Here’s six key actions, executive orders and promises, from this past week and how they would affect inflation.” More: “‘The reality is, inflation of the type we have gets embedded into the economy and takes a long time to wring out,’ said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. ‘There aren’t many quick solutions.'” Be that as it may, the six: Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; New tariffs and trade policies [▲]; Expanding oil and gas drilling, other energy overhauls [▼]; Rolling back regulations [▼]; Undoing Biden’s efforts to lower prescription drug prices[?]; Lowering interest rates[▲].” • Triangles for what WaPo thinks could go up, or down. “Trump shocks the system. Will he solve problems voters care about most?” [Dan Balz, WaPo]. “The larger issue for Trump, and what ultimately will determine the political and substantive success of his second term, is whether this flurry of activity signaling a major course change will result in the betterment of the lives of the voters who supported him in November. Getting rid of DEI offices and personnel will cheer his most loyal supporters and hurt a federal workforce in a nation becoming more ethnically diverse. It won’t necessarily help families struggling to pay bills. Deporting millions of undocumented immigrants in fact could raise food prices and further labor shortages…. Shocking the system is one thing. Providing tangible results to people is another.” 2028 “The 12 Democrats who make the most sense for 2028” [WaPo]. Starts out well: “Save for a few months at the tail end of the 2024 campaign, the party hasn’t had an authoritative, dominant leader for a long time.” Really? 2024? Who was that? Anyhow, here are the 12, starting with #12: Tim Walz, Josh Stein, Andy Beshear, Gavin Newsom, Raphael G. Warnock, Wes Moore, Ruben Gallego, John Fetterman, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, and — at #1! — Josh Shapiro. It’s been a long time since I deployed the “Please kill me now” trope…. Our Famously Free Press “Too Much News, Redux” [Jon Allsop, Columbia Journalism Review]. “I noted in 2020 that the ‘basic rhythms’ of the news business aren’t designed to cope with deluges of huge stories: whatever the day’s news, it must be stretched or shrunk to fill roughly the same number of newspaper column inches or cable news hours; the internet, of course, theoretically offers near-infinite space for news coverage to expand, but many digital formats—from homepages to newsletters—themselves have spatial limits, and that’s before we get into strained newsroom resources and apparently diminished audience buy-in, as Stelter pointed out last week. These constraints make it hard for the news media, as a collective apparatus, to communicate proportion. We have tools for organizing stories by importance—back in 2020, I noted that the New York Times had run thirty-three banner front-page print headlines in less than six months, smashing even its election-year average—but the constant blare of headlines, as I noted, can have a ‘flattening effect, making it harder, over a long period of time, to distinguish actual news from attention hustling.’ The problem of proportionality is recurring now. A story previewing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s potentially radical plans to ‘target vaccines’ should he be confirmed as health and human services secretary appeared about halfway down a major Politico newsletter on Friday; yesterday, the CIA lab-leak story made the front page of the Times, but only in brief form at the very bottom. Needless to say that in the summer of 2020, both these stories would have been earth-shaking.” • Allsop complains of Trump’s tendency to make news, or at least news stories — “flood the zone with sh*t” — but I think there are more stories out there, as one would expect as a function of slow civilizational collapse (newsrooms are smaller too). Democrats en déshabillé “Playbook: A tough Week One for Democrats” [Politico]. “On Saturday, at their winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, Democrats will make their first consequential decision since their November drubbing: selecting a new chair of the DNC. In the opening days of the new administration, Democrats have struggled to frame Republicans, careening from the critique that Trump has surrounded himself with ‘broligarchs,’ as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) put it, to whether Elon Musk made a Nazi salute. Senate Democrats have zigged and zagged on their Cabinet confirmation votes. Of course, not all nominees are equal. But they are clearly divided over tactics in responding to Trump’s program.” • Maybe — hear me out — the important Democrat problems aren’t at the tactical level? “In the wilderness: Democrats struggle to navigate the politics of new Trump era” [Guardian]. “‘He’s been in office less than a week, and you’ve already seen a federal court with a judge who was appointed by a Republican president – a president that much of the conservative movement in America upholds – say that he’s operating blatantly unconstitutionally,’ said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the non-profit legal group Democracy Forward. ‘I think what you’re going to see is more sophisticated legal responses this time because civil society, I think, is much more organized and savvy to this playbook.’ Democracy Forward is one of more than 350 organizations that have joined a coalition known as Democracy 2025, which has the explicit aim of ‘disrupting any efforts by the Trump-Vance administration to attack our rights.’ ‘The message that we want to send to all Americans across the country is thbe doing is demanding a president and a Congress that does the same thing,’ Perryman said.” • So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizatioat there are lawyers and advocates who are going to be in court every single day fighting for your rights, and what we need to ns is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole. “Trump Just Broke the Law. Blatantly. And He Might Get Away With It” [Michael Tomaskey, The New Republic]. On Trump firing the 15 Inspectors General: “Under the original law, presidents had to give Congress 30 days’ notice about their intent to fire an I.G. and just supply some vague reason why. President Barack Obama’s excuse for firing the I.G. of national service programs was simply a lack of confidence in the guy. Then came Trump. As Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith wrote at Lawfare in 2022, ‘More frequently than prior presidents, [Trump] manipulated vacancies and related laws to fire or dismiss disliked inspectors general and replace them, pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), with a more like-minded or pliant official.’ So Congress, through a larger defense bill, amended the I.G. law by replacing the word ‘reasons’ with the phrase ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.’ In sum, Congress toughened this law because of Trump. And now, Trump has broken the provision that was added in response to his flouting of the original law! That he broke the law is obvious. He didn’t give 30 days’ notice. He didn’t provide any ‘substantive rationale.’ He didn’t provide any reason at all. He just did it. And he told reporters Saturday that it was all fine. ‘It’s a very common thing to do,’ he said. Once he says that, we know that basically every Republican, and Fox News and Sinclair and the rest of the propaganda chamber, are going to say the same thing. Lindsey Graham on Sunday hilariously admitted that ‘technically, yeah,’ Trump broke the law but Graham wasn’t losing any sleep over it.” • It’s a good thing that four solid years of lawfare (eight, if you count RussiaGate) didn’t make people cynical about Democrat accusations of illegality, because this thing looks like it could have legs. Realignment and Legitimacy “Column: The rise of Silicon Valley, from indifference to lords of the political universe” [Los Angeles Times]. “When the high and mighty of Silicon Valley assumed their privileged perch at the swearing-in of President Trump, it was an ostentatious show of wealth and power unlike any before. ‘You could go back to the Gilded Age and you could have a similar concentration of capital and power. You know, Rockefeller and Carnegie,’ said historian Margaret O’Mara, citing two of the richest men who ever bestrode the earth. ‘But they weren’t on the dais of the inauguration.’…. The explanation for their propinquity lies not in the creation of some whiz-bang, life-changing, paradigm-bending consumer product, or the shining virtues or particularly fertile minds that grace Silicon Valley’s fruited plain. ‘It’s one of the oldest truisms in politics,’ said Larry Gerston, a San José State political science professor emeritus, who’s followed the tech industry from a front-row seat for decades. ‘Money buys access.’ Bezos’ Amazon and Zuckerberg’s Meta were among the tech firms that tithed $1 million each to help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Musk invested more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump.

From December 5, 2024: “[D]ata strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily* through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow…. In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. ‘Milk is hugely problematic,’ said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.” • Detail on how humans and robots milk cows.

Walker even conjectures that our peculiar sleep patterns may explain our evolutionary advance. We sleep less than other primates, but get relatively more REM sleep, and the dreams it brings, than our monkey and ape cousins. It is during REM sleep, Walker insists, that we engage in ’emotional processing.’ The mnemonic collisions during this phase forge new connections among our experiences, and we wake not merely refreshed but revived and enlightened by our re-wrought neural networks.” • Hmm. * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Great links today. Thanks. > Great links today. Thanks. Well, thank you! Love the Hopper painting as well “Rooms for Tourists.” Found this- ‘Edward Hopper’s paintings of buildings are portraits, in which the human presence is implied but not seen. In Rooms for Tourists, Hopper portrays the exterior of a boarding house in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He made study drawings of the building and then traveled there repeatedly at night while he worked on the painting. The contrast between the warm, electrically lit interior and the darkness of night outside captures the sense of transience and impermanence inherent in the boarding house’s impersonal arrivals and departures.’ https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/52638 “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseeks-janus-pro-ai-model-beats-rivals-image-generation-2025-01-27/ > “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” We need a Sam Altman Downfall parody, for sure.

Moon of Alabama wrote this development up. The Raspberry Pi’s are now sold out. Deepseek software is free and will run on this device. This deserves some recognition. Please stop amplifying nonsense. Deepseek’s frontier model R1 is 671 billion parameters. Model parameters are directly correlated with compute requirements and quality of output. 671 billion parameter model won’t run on a powerful desktop computer, let alone a Raspberry Pi. Even with their optimization tricks, it still has to compute 32 billion parameters. What they were running on pi is a tiny model with terrible output quality. All tiny models (and I have played with many) are toys, and their outputs are completely unreliable. Smaller 7 billion parameter models do run on desktop computers already, including small Llama, Mistral, Gemma etc. models with a 6 core Ryzen CPU running it are an intolerable 20-30 tokens per second. To give you a reference of that speed, the model would output the length of your comment in about 5 seconds. Tiny models with 1 billion parameters run on Rasberry pi’s, and DeepSeek’s tiny-model is not the first one to do so. There are AI video tools that could do this, put his face on Hitler. Could they capture his uber-PMC mannerisms? We need a new classification to describe half-built, abandoned data centers, now that DeepSeek has moved our tech oligarchs cheese. Busted bunkers? Rebar-wrecks? I am sure Wukchumni will have a nice suggestion. Maybe make nightclubs from the wreckage? This Los Angeles Stock Exchange building opened in 1931 and the company merged into the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in 1956. It was incorporated as the Pacific Stock Exchange in 1973.It was the largest regional stock exchange west of the Mississippi. In 1986, the exchange moved to another site. By the end of the decade, the Stock Exchange, a nightclub, opened in the renovated building. All-night raves in the site of an abandoned rebar-wreck … I like it! With all that physical security built in (6-foot thick walls, security cameras, fences) it will keep the cops out, too. Bomb shelters probably made good speakeasies, back in the day. If they can pull it off, panic at the disco shifting nicely to panacea at the datacenter Indoor bull rings? Go all Elizabethan and include Bear Rings too! Here’s a Ryan Grim post explaining the current DeepSeek invasion and a shout out to Lisa Kahn: “U.S. tech stocks are plummeting as China looks to be exposing American companies involved in AI as wildly overvalued. It’s a predictable consequence of how the American government has approached Silicon Valley and vice versa. This isn’t the kind of thing we normally cover, but we don’t quite trust the U.S. media to tell this story accurately.” https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/deepseek-openai-lina-khan-sam-altman Very good timeline development and technology explanation.

Democrats doing lawfare is also an admission that the current system services liberal Democrat purposes just fine, Their Democracy, and they don’t have any particular interests in making any changes that might provide material benefits. Kind of mind-bending that we went from the Biggest Threat Ever to Trump is a president to be opposed by gentle lawfare efforts. Wat? Anyone can do lawfare. Part of the Civil Rights Revolution was conducted through the Courts, and that was lawfare. Lawfare was one weapons system and demonstrations/marches/Freedom Rides/etc. was another weapons system and political organizing/registering to vote/voting was another weapons system. Damage suits against the oil companies are lawfare. If lawfare is the only weapons system you have, you use that or you use nothing at all. So the question becomes, who is using lawfare against whom, and in service to what? Democracy 2025. Lambert comments: “So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizations is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole.” But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely that’s all we need to know, isn’t it?

The democrat list for 2025 looks like they want a president Vance. Also just read a Tweet from team D that Orange Hitler has spent 30% of his presidency playing golf. Giggle. So he has done so much his first week they can’t get a grip on what to be outraged about, yet he spent too much time playing golf. Crazy times we live in. Did they factor in the time spent on that Colombia President mulligan? ;) It really is not a good look at all for AOC, et al. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. Meanwhile, and so far, all the attention rounding up these illegals seems to be on the criminals, etc. I would make a rational assumption that the planes to Colombia are pretty much those kind of immigrants. In other words, exactly who needs to be sent home. And by so doing – protecting the kids and families of America who should not be forced to live next to pimps, drug runners and criminals. My patient family today who brought in their grandma were just effusively singing the praises of Donald Trump. “He understood these bad people need to go home” and “he cares about our safety”. etc. Ummm, AOC – the coffee and flowers routine is not working on these people. Of course coffee and daily Starbucks hits are much more important issues to your constituency. It will be really entertaining when it is Mexico’s turn….Oh me oh my, what are we ever going to do without our avocado toast? Better luck next time. Not to mention is the entire flower issue is predicated on the fact that the entire industry was moved to Colombia by NAFTA neoliberals, leaving all of those American workers behind to learn how to code and leaving boarded up greenhouses – STILL THERE – saw it this summer – in their wake. The other thought going through my head last night…….There must be a couple hundred very bad people on that plane that the President of Colombia would risk a trade war to keep them out. This is going to be a very interesting four years. This is going to be a very long four years for the AOC crowd if this absolutely pitiful response is going to be the best they can do. One thing that the “rights people” do that’s offensive to those whom they think they are currying favor with is that they go out of way defending various dubious people who happen to be members of a certain group, as if they are being persecuted because they belong to that group, while ignoring the bit about their being dubious (e.g. criminals etc.) They feed the preconception (which, perhaps, they themelves hold, that members of that group are predisposed to criminality, say (and, worse, “can’t help themselves,” because of culture or whatever.) In other words, attempts at playing “culturism” winds up being pretty much a perpetuation of racism (possibly, that, their own racism.) Having been on the other end often enough (allegedly positive “model minority” stereotypes and variations of thinly disguised “yellow peril” ones), I’ve found this tendency profoundly offensive a bit too often. This makes a deal of sense. The NGOs claiming to rescue the victims must insist the victims are always and immutably victims. There is no out or up or escape into better lives for the victims, only the ministrations of the NGOs can make the victims lives better, the NGOs may claim. The NGOs may do good work at one level but terrible blocking at another level. I am amazed that people, especially intelligent people who should know better, eat up the propaganda stunt of the denied deportation flight. Look at how I’m going to stare down the government of any country on earth: 1. arrange a flight that doesn’t follow normal protocols (shackling deportees), using military planes (do you want other countries to fly their military planes into the US without getting permission first??) 2. say nasty things when flight gets rejected 3. arrange a more normal flight the next day 4. declare victory when it gets accepted Also, if he’s really going to do mass deportations, where is he going to get all the planes? Why isn’t anyone talking about ships yet? (Hint: he’s not really serious about the mass deportations.) They say their target is 1200-1500 people per day. That is at most less that 2.2 million people over Trump’s entire term. My understanding is that 2 million illegal migrants came every year during Biden’s term. So they’d need to increase the rate four-fold to return the number of illegal migrants at the end of Trump’s first term. There were supposedly 12 million illegal migrants in the US at the end of Trump’s first term, and if an additional 8 million arrived, there would be 20 million of them. That would mean each one has a 1/10=10% chance of being deported. Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; I don’t see why we should expect that to cause inflation, particularly if those who are deported have been convicted of engaging in activities that reduce productivity (crimes such as theft, procuring drugs, making places unsafe, etc). It’s not as if Biden’s term, during which the number of illegal migrants increased by 8 million, is known for reducing inflation. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. I guess the one million homeless Americans, the threats to the food supply, not to mention the price of it, and various other things are not important? If I couldn’t afford coffee, I would just buy tea, as much as I have started with coffee most every morning for forty years. Really, the arguments from the Democratic Party and its supporters are getting more unserious by the day. very good IM DOC, lets remind all what NAFTA stands for, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement North American Free Trade Agreement it was sold to us by neo-liberal weasels in the economic professions, politicians, media shills as free trade, because it is free trade for a few. now they say there is no such thing as free trade, after its imploded. under free trade, government no longer has sovereignty and democratic control. government is now subservient to capital, they now are the enforcers of free trade for capital. https://fpif.org/free-trade-regime-oligarchy-action/ “Let’s put this assertion to the test by looking at the concrete example of free trade agreements and their relation to democracy and national sovereignty. “Democracy” typically refers to a system of government in which people decide on the rules of their sovereign nation. In the true spirit of democracy and sovereignty, all spheres of policy — including the environment, trade, finance, intellectual property, and culture — must be subject to a fair political process and self-determination. In the modern, globalized world, the institutions of democracy and sovereignty exist in tension with another powerful institution: the global market and its free trade regimes.” “While a small number of labor unions and NGOs appear to have some involvement in the process, critics note that many relevant actors have been shut out. As renowned economists Joseph Stiglitz and Dean Baker contend, it is mostly the executive branch and some privileged big corporations that are involved in the process, and are therefore able to shape the treaty to fit their narrow interests.” Pretty sure we’ll have winged piglet passenger service between Davenport and Muscatine before any of those 12 losers get elected President.

People who nap in my culture are considers sick or strange. But our nights in the winter are so long that we sleep longer at night in the winter and less in the summer. Maybe it is not so much the the siesta is good for all of us, but good for those living in lower latitudes. Or maybe we are all so disconnected from nature that we cannot even feel the natural rhythms anymore, and maybe those with insomnia are just much more sensitive. If you are interested, here are some historical photographs of the Sami. REM sleep, the hard way. Prostate brachytherapy, with multiple waking periods per night. N=1, easy to fall back to sleep and dream, so that is good. Life span extended, too. :) I used to fight the nap, go 12 rounds or so and then fall asleep at an accepted hour after dark, but now that i’m on the verge of geezerhood, quite enjoy a 3 or 4 hour bender in the afternoon-you are feeling very sleepy. (waves pocket watch in a swinging motion) Maybe once a week I’ll partake. Thanks for that interesting Sami photo portfolio. -cheers, a.v. Agreed, I very much enjoyed that link! The idea of a straight through eight hour sleep is relatively new apparently. Time was when it was custom to go to sleep for a coupla hours, get up for a while – and maybe even go for a walk – and then go to sleep for several hours more. It was our move into an industrial society that broke this sleep pattern- https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/sleeping-through-the-night-is-a-relatively-new-invention.html Time was, not even so very long ago, relatively speaking, when hominins had to get up to tend the fire. I’m sure that King David had others to tend the fire for him. But he still got up at midnight, as Psalm 119:62 shows. If Politico is quoting Amy Klobuchar, my money’s on Ken Martin. In so very many ways he’s the worst possible choice and therefore irrestistable to the double-downers in the DNC. Same link also quotes Slotkin (MI) trash talking Tulsi Gabbard with one-sided anecdotes and a completely unattributed allegation that Gabbard is not very intelligent, leading me to think that CIA embeds aren’t as smart as we’ve been led to believe. Is it out of bounds to say that Tulsi Gabbard scares the crap out CIA and the other 15 to 20 intelligence agencies and their fan girls and fan boys in Congress.She has been on the right side of the issues of which I am aware. They have either been wrong, “misinformed” or flat out spinning yarns to keep the cash flowing in all the right directions. It has reached the point that if the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber says something, I assume it is at best distorted and often flatly false. Tulsi might let a bit of light into that dark and fetid room that is DC. Here’s to hoping Tulsi exposes this dark underbelly of the American Empire! #GEAUXTULSI . . . ” • Of course, some might suggest that we want Trump to “work” as little possible. ” . . .

Good data as usual. New Patrick Lawrence takes a glass half full look at the Trump liftoff and even ventures some explanations. Many of the big-name philosophers of the past 100 years — Husserl, Heidegger, Lévinas, et al. — shared a pronounced preoccupation beginning in the 1920s. I relate this (and the scholars may correct me) to the wreckage of the First World War they found all around them. These were the explorers and developers of the discipline called phenomenology. Who are we? What has become of us, we who dwell in mass, mechanized societies? What is the nature of human relationships? These were among the questions. Emmanuel Lévinas, a Lithuanian Jew who lived in France (1906–1995) and wrote in French, elevated these matters to an enduring discourse concerning the Self and the Other. Indifference to others, he argued — and how radically must I simplify — lay at the root of the 20th century’s ills and evils. The cult of the individual, he posited (among a lot of other things) must be transcended in favor of relationships with all the Others among us. We realize who we are only by way of these relationships; they are primary. “The Self is possible only through the recognition of the Other,” he wrote, a noted line. So, to continue my simplification: We are social beings first; our individuality derives from our sociality. Lévinas published Totality and Infinity, the book wherein he stated his case most fully and famously, in 1961. […] Americans are not well-advantaged in these matters, to put the point mildly. We long ago turned our insistence in our individuality into the “ism” of individualism, an ideology that, however far it has taken America in the past, now proves a ball and chain at our ankles. Equally, America has had such power since the 1945 victories that its policy cliques long ago lost interest in the perspectives of others—how the world looks to them, their aspirations, their histories, all the rest. This is why, with admirable but few exceptions, America produces such poor diplomats. It has had no need of them. And the policy cliques in Washington have not yet registered that we have in consequence already begun to fail. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/27/patrick-lawrence-trumps-failures-americas-failures/ He’s saying the American cult of individualism also accounts for Trump’s pronouncements about the countries he wants to take over or the map points to be renamed. It’s a bit of megalomania to be sure but also the provincialism of someone who doesn’t worry much about how others might see these ideas. And for that reason he’s saying it’s very unlikely that most of them will come to pass including, one hopes, his recent statements about the Middle East. By contrast the Bidenistas’ fantasies were serious as a heart attack. One might well claim that in that instance the America above all others view morphed into sociopathy. Thanks for your comment. One argument I’ve read about T touting a north-south US empire vs an east-west empire is that the neocon dream of an east-west empire has hit a stopping point. Whereas, in comparison, a north-south empire can still be achieved in some fashion, and would also undercut the neocon east-west dreams, if one wanted to undercut the neocon dreams. Not a bad argument, imo. Reminds me of Cheneys quip about creating their own reality and everyone else just having to go with it. ” Thinking ChatGPT is useless is midwit” . . . is midwit.

How many of this bottom 75% would be ready to form or join a party called the New Deal America Party? ( That would take millions of person-hours at teach-ins all over the country to explain to Americans below a certain age what the “New Deal” even was. Only then could people decide about joining such a thing or not. I think it would be worth doing, though. Maybe it could be taught about in that nationwide network of Reading Rooms which no successor to OWS has yet been able to organize and fund itself to the point of being able to create).

ATW Livestream Tonight at 8 PM ET/7 PM CT https://www.racket.news/p/atw-livestream-tonight-at-8-pm-et7-1a5 I’ve been watching Tucker Carlson’s lengthy interview with Matt. Good to see Matt in that platform, though sad to see him pushing the idea that masks were unnecessary and their use was instituted as a way of “inducing social conformity”. He seems to be a big Battacharya fan. Matt did say that inducing social conformity might well have been a motive and, as I understood it, after the fact. I do not recall him saying masks were per se unnecessary. Yes, sad indeed, much as I enjoy Matt’s commentary on many things. He falls into a special category of writers who are usually so spot on, that when they go off into the deep end it is so absurdly wacky and obvious that I’m prepared to cut him more slack that I would for someone of lesser talents. And yet, do we throw out the baby with the bath water? Or do we do our own research (horrors!) and come to our own conclusions? Taking Taibbi and many others into account? The US’s ye olde health authorities having fallen into disrepute, I’ll read widely and come to my own conclusions. Gasp! From How the Messy Process of Milking Cows Can Spread Bird Flu It takes seven hours for the farm to milk all 1,050 cows. Then, the workers spend an hour cleaning, which includes washing out the milking equipment with detergent and hot water. After that, the next eight-hour shift begins, and all the cows are milked again. It’s hard to believe this doesn’t milk the cows to death. Like a war, this runs 24/7. My family’s dairy farm used to milk the cows twice per day, about 10-11 hours apart, so the schedule from the link isn’t that drastic. Also, dairy cows are “dried off” (not milked at all) for several weeks per year. I’m sure though that your average cow in an industrial herd has a shorter lifespan than one on a small farm that sends most of her day out in the field. That sounds right and on an industrial milk factory as described it would take hours to clean the equipment. If the cows are milked in the same order the milkings would be 10 to 11, maybe 12 hours apart. re: Gallery Wonderful and hilarious Chas Addams cartoon to think most readers identified with and got a laugh from the Addams Family cartoons.

Around 44 million cubic metres/110 million tonnes (120 million short tons) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain. Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town’s residents died, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Slide It’s quite an exciting start to the New Year, LA Fires, DeepSeek deep sixing Open AI, Trump tossing shit bombs in every direction and best of all I haven’t heard a cackle from Harris..

I came to the conclusion that Japan is governed by customs, unlike the US which is governed by laws. Yet, if we denigrate both norms and lawsuits, what recourse remains? Heraclitus (fragment 249): “The people must fight on behalf of the law as though for the city wall.” Abraham Lincoln (in “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.”): “As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor…. Let reverence for the laws…become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.” Law is the ultimate propaganda. I think not in the US. Else why would Davos fellow the American John Kerry claim the US Constitution’s !st Amendment regarding freedom of speech a difficultly and an impediment for “their right to rule”? Where said “their right” is an entirely undemocratic and shadowy body? Japan has extremely well-shared and well-enforced norms, something absent in the US. So less friction. Hence the recourse in the US to lawsuits (or as some would have it, to lawfare). Property, liberty, and wardship compose authority, first in the solitary individual, then in the family, and finally in the state. (At the state level, wardship consists of all laws, magistracies, judiciary, arms, fortifications, wars, and treaties.) Civil authority, comprised of all three, is political sovereignty, but from what shall this authority derive its justification? Authority is related to certitude as reason is related to truth. Truth is the object of divine reason–Only god knows the Truth; certitude is all that belongs to man. This certitude depends not on reason but on authority–the authority of our senses or of our informants or of those who have enacted the laws which we receive as determinant or certain. Certitude is a partial knowledge. Certitude is subjective. Certitude is empirical, dependent on experience or tradition, and not on reason. Hence, progress in history and politics consists in the gradual assimilation of authority to reason. In theory, anyway. The true ‘Red Flag’ in that Resume Now list is the fact that 3 in 10 report having taken out debt to pay living expenses. The more immiserated people become, the more desperate they become, the more angry they become. We are thus seeing first-hand the creation of a revolutionary mass. As people become increasingly “homeless,” Power truly will be out in the street waiting to be picked up. What the American Democrat Party needs now is an American Lenin to force them into action. Re: “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” “It’s a total black box,” a lobbyist close to the administration told Axios. “Nothing is leaking except what they want.” There’s a “strong silo system” that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added. So… “forum-shopping and end-running administration officials” means either the way things worked in the Trump 1.0 admin, or else it means this has just been the standard operating procedure for DC lobbyists under any recent admin (given time, tho, I’m sure the lobbyists will figure it out). On this subject, if anybody can suggest a good article or book on how lobbyists and lobbying work in DC, I’d be grateful to hear. Is this “news story” real? Or is it satire?

Title: Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Shakes up Silicon Valley, Wall Street
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-shakes-up-silicon-valley-wall-street/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:56:54Z

Shares of Nvidia, the darling stock of the generative AI boom, are down 15.3% in midday trading on Monday (Jan. 27) as Wall Street grapples with the revelation that it could be overpaying for this emerging technology. Google, Microsoft and Amazon shares are also down. The culprit: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) models that perform on par with OpenAI’s and Google’s top models but at a fraction of the cost and with far fewer of Nvidia’s GPUs. DeepSeek was founded by Liang Wenfeng, who also co-founded a quantitative hedge fund in China called High-Flyer. DeepSeek has released a family of models: V3 (AI chat) and R1 (reasoning models). The startup said R1 had cost $5.58 million and used 2,048 of Nvidia’s H800 chips to train, according to a paper published by its researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that AI models currently cost $100 million to train, but it could hit $100 billion. AI executives have also said training would need thousands of AI chips, principally those made by Nvidia. The sell-off comes as OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX announced a project called Stargate last week that plans to spend $100 billion to half a trillion dollars to build AI infrastructure, mainly data centers. Those and other AI cost estimates are now in question. Shares of Microsoft were down 3.7%, Google fell 3% and Amazon gave up about 1%. “Artificial intelligence has reached a critical inflection point. The industry stands at a crossroads where escalating costs, environmental concerns, and innovation appear intertwined, threatening to stifle accessibility and adoption,” Gokul Naidu, a consultant for SAP, told PYMNTS. “Enter DeepSeek-R1, the model that’s turning heads in Silicon Valley and beyond for proving that high performance and affordability aren’t mutually exclusive.” “DeepSeek challenges the narrative that innovation must come at an unsustainable cost,” Naidu said. “For businesses, this means AI could soon be accessible to small and medium enterprises, not just tech giants with deep pockets.” DeepSeek could “catalyze a shift in Silicon Valley’s approach to AI,” Naidu said. “Historically, the tech epicenter has prioritized growth at all costs, often ignoring questions of efficiency. But DeepSeek forces a recalibration. With its dramatically lower cost structure, businesses and developers alike are reevaluating their priorities, focusing on efficiency-driven growth.” DeepSeek is now the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back in a post on X last month, when DeepSeek V3 first came out, saying, “It is (relatively) easy to copy something that you know works. it is extremely hard to do something new, risky, and difficult when you don’t know if it will work. individual researchers rightly get a lot of glory for that when they do it! it’s the coolest thing in the world.” DeepSeek also reportedly is subject to Chinese censorship, refusing to answer questions about Taiwan, for example. (Developers can get around this by revising the open-source models.) Marc Andreessen, from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, posted on X that “DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.” Naidu said DeepSeek’s open-source strategy “further amplifies its impact. OpenAI’s proprietary approach, while effective, limits transparency and collaboration. By contrast, DeepSeek invites developers worldwide to contribute, experiment, and build on its platform. This open-source ethos democratizes AI capabilities, fostering a more inclusive innovative ecosystem.” Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun said in a post on LinkedIn that people concerned that China is overtaking the U.S. in AI are misreading DeepSeek’s impact. “The correct reading is: Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones. DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source. … They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.” Meta, whose strategy was to distribute open-source AI models, saw its shares up 1%. With open source, any developer can download and fine-tune, or retrain to customize, their AI models. However, developers typically still have to pay fees to access the model through APIs. While Meta doesn’t charge to access its API, DeepSeek does. But Naidu said DeepSeek is also deeply discounted here: “DeepSeek charges $0.55 per million tokens, compared to OpenAI’s o1 model, which demands $15 per million tokens. For businesses wary of runaway operational bills, this is a game-changer.” Many developers build their own AI applications atop the foundation models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and others. To access and use these models, such as inputting prompts and getting responses, developers have to pay AI pricing based on token volume. (A thousand tokens translates to roughly 750 words.) Naidu also pointed out that DeepSeek was also able to get around President Joe Biden’s export controls on advanced AI chips, which he recently expanded to carve out different levels of access for more than 120 countries. “DeepSeek’s achievement is particularly impressive given its constraints,” Naidu said. “As a Chinese company facing export restrictions, it was unable to access the latest Nvidia GPUs, such as the H200, and instead relied on older H800 GPUs. Yet, the R1 model still managed to rival — or, in some tests, outperform — more expensive counterparts.” “This feat speaks volumes about the ingenuity behind DeepSeek’s approach. It’s not just about throwing money at the problem; it’s about finding smarter, leaner ways to train and deploy AI systems,” Naidu added. Naidu cited the following ripple effects from DeepSeek: “DeepSeek is more than a model — it’s a wake-up call for the entire AI industry,” Naidu said. “It challenges entrenched assumptions about the cost of innovation and offers a path forward where cutting-edge technology is both affordable and sustainable. As we move deeper into 2025, the conversation around AI is no longer just about power — it’s about power at the right price. “And in this race, DeepSeek might just have redefined the finish line.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: What to Know About DeepSeek, the Chinese AI Company Causing Stock Market Chaos

Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:55:12Z

A new Chinese AI model, created by the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, has stunned the American AI industry by outperforming some of OpenAI’s leading models, displacing ChatGPT at the top of the iOS app store, and usurping Meta as the leading purveyor of so-called open source AI tools. All of which has raised a critical question: despite American sanctions on Beijing’s ability to access advanced semiconductors, is China catching up with the U.S. in the global AI race? At a supposed cost of just $6 million to train, DeepSeek’s new R1 model, released last week, was able to match the performance on several math and reasoning metrics by OpenAI’s o1 model – the outcome of tens of billions of dollars in investment by OpenAI and its patron Microsoft. The Chinese model is also cheaper for users. Access to its most powerful versions costs some 95% less than OpenAI and its competitors. The upshot: the U.S. tech industry is suddenly faced with a potentially cheaper and more powerful challenger, unnerving investors, who sold off American tech stocks on Monday morning. Yet not everyone is convinced. Some American AI researchers have cast doubt on DeepSeek’s claims about how much it spent, and how many advanced chips it deployed to create its model. Few, however, dispute DeepSeek’s stunning capabilities. “Deepseek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,” wrote prominent American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen on X, referring to the moment in the Cold War when the Soviet Union managed to put a satellite in orbit ahead of the United States. So, what is DeepSeek and what could it mean for U.S. tech supremacy? DeepSeek was founded less than two years ago by the Chinese hedge fund High Flyer as a research lab dedicated to pursuing Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. A spate of open source releases in late 2024 put the startup on the map, including the large language model “v3”, which outperformed all of Meta's open-source LLMs and rivaled OpenAI's closed-source GPT4-o. At the time, Liang Wenfeng, the CEO, reportedly said that he had hired young computer science researchers with a pitch to “solve the hardest questions in the world"—critically, without aiming for profits. Early signs were promising: his products were so efficient that DeepSeek’s 2024 releases sparked a price war within the Chinese AI industry, forcing competitors to slash prices. This year, that price war looks set to reach across the Pacific Ocean. Yet DeepSeek’s AI looks different from its U.S. competitors in one important way. Despite their high performance on reasoning tests, Deepseek’s models are constrained by China’s restrictive policies regarding criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). DeepSeek R1 refuses to answer questions about the massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in 1989, for example. “Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else,” the model said when queried by TIME. At a moment when Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and dozens of their competitors are preparing to spend further tens of billions of dollars on new AI infrastructure, DeepSeek’s success has raised a troubling question: Could Chinese tech firms potentially match, or even surpass, their technical prowess while spending significantly less? Meta, which plans to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, has already set up four “war rooms” to analyze DeepSeek’s models, seeking to find out how the Chinese firm had managed to train a model so cheaply and use the insights to improve its own open source Llama models, tech news site The Information reported over the weekend. In the financial markets, Nvidia’s stock price dipped more than 15% on Monday morning on fears that fewer AI chips may be necessary to train powerful AI than previously thought. Other American tech stocks were also trading lower. “While [DeepSeek R1] is good news for users and the global economy, it is bad news for U.S. tech stocks,” says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “It may result in a nominal downsizing of capital investment in AI and pressure on margins, at a time when valuation and growth expectations are very stretched.” But American tech hasn’t lost—at least not yet. For now, OpenAI’s “o1 Pro” model is still considered the most advanced in the world. The performance of DeepSeek R1, however, does suggest that China is much closer to the frontier of AI than previously thought, and that open-source models have just about caught up to their closed-source counterparts. Perhaps even more worrying for companies like OpenAI and Google, whose models are closed source, is how much—or rather, how little—DeepSeek is charging consumers to access its most advanced models. OpenAI charges $60 per million “tokens”, or segments of words, outputted by its most advanced model, o1. By contrast DeepSeek charges $2.19 for the same number of tokens from R1—nearly 30 times less. “It erodes the industrial base, it erodes the margin, it erodes the incentive for further capital investment into western [AI] scaling from private sources,” says Edouard Harris, the chief technology officer of Gladstone AI, an AI firm that works closely with the U.S. government. DeepSeek’s success was all the more explosive because it seemed to call into question the effectiveness of the U.S. government’s strategy to constrain China’s AI ecosystem by restricting the export of powerful chips, or GPUs, to Beijing. If DeepSeek’s claims are accurate, it means China has the ability to create powerful AI models despite those restrictions, underlining the limits of the U.S. strategy. DeepSeek has claimed it is constrained by access to chips, not cash or talent, saying it trained its models v3 and R1 using just 2,000 second-tier Nvidia chips. “Money has never been the problem for us,” DeepSeek’s CEO, Liang Wenfeng, said in 2024. “Bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” (Current U.S. policy makes it illegal to export to China the most advanced types of AI chips, the likes of which populate U.S. datacenters used by OpenAI and Microsoft.) But are those claims true? “My understanding is DeepSeek has 50,000 H100s,” Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently told CNBC in Davos, referring to the highest-powered Nvidia GPU chips currently on the market. “They can’t talk about [them], because it is against the export controls that the U.S. has put in place.” (An H100 cluster of that size would cost in the region of billions of dollars.) In a sign of how seriously the CCP is taking the technology, Liang, Deepseek’s CEO, met with China’s premier Li Qiang in Beijing last Monday. In that meeting, Liang reportedly told Li that DeepSeek needs more chips. “DeepSeek only has access to a few thousand GPUs, and yet they’re pulling this off,” says Jeremie Harris, CEO of Gladstone AI. “So this raises the obvious question: what happens when they get an allocation from the Chinese Communist Party to proceed at full speed?” Even though China might have achieved a startling level of AI capability with fewer chips, experts say more computing power will always remain a strategic advantage. On that front, the U.S. remains far ahead. “It's never a bad thing to have more of it,” says Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University. “No matter how much you have of it, you will always use it.” The short answer: from Washington’s perspective, in uncertain waters. In the closing days of the Biden Administration, outgoing National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned that the speed of AI advancement was “the most consequential thing happening in the world right now.” And just days into his new job, President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture, backed by OpenAI and others, to build the infrastructure vital for the creation of “artificial general intelligence”— the next leap forward in AI, with systems advanced enough to make new scientific breakthroughs and reason in ways that have so far remained in the realm of science fiction. Read More: What to Know About ‘Stargate,’ OpenAI’s New Venture Announced by President Trump And although questions remain about the future of U.S. chip restrictions on China, Washington’s priorities were apparent in President Trump’s AI executive order, also signed during his first week in office, which declared that “it is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.” Maintaining this dominance will mean, at least in part, understanding exactly what Chinese tech firms are doing—as well as protecting U.S. intellectual property, experts say. “There's a good chance that DeepSeek and many of the other big Chinese companies are being supported by the [Chinese] government, in more than just a monetary way,” says Edouard Harris of Gladstone AI, who also recommended that U.S. AI companies harden their security measures. Since December, OpenAI’s new o1 and o3 models have smashed records on advanced reasoning tests designed to be difficult for AI models to pass. Read More: AI Models Are Getting Smarter. New Tests Are Racing to Catch Up DeepSeek R1 does something similar, and in the process exemplifies what many researchers say is a paradigm shift: instead of scaling the amount of computing power used to train the model, researchers scale the amount of time (and thus, computing power and electricity) the model uses to think about a response to a query before answering. It is this scaling of what researchers call “test-time compute” that distinguishes the new class of “reasoning models,” such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI’s o1, from their less sophisticated predecessors. Many AI researchers believe there’s plenty of headroom left before this paradigm hits its limit. Some AI researchers hailed DeepSeek’s R1 as a breakthrough on the same level as DeepMind’s AlphaZero, a 2017 model that became superhuman at the board games Chess and Go by purely playing against itself and improving, rather than observing any human games. That’s because R1 wasn’t “pretrained” on human-labeled data in the same way as other leading LLMs. Instead, DeepSeek’s researchers found a way to allow the model to bootstrap its own reasoning capabilities essentially from scratch. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies,” they claim. The finding is significant because it suggests that powerful AI capabilities might emerge more rapidly and with less human effort than previously thought, with just the application of more computing power. “DeepSeek R1 is like GPT-1 of this scaling paradigm,” says Ball. Ultimately, China’s recent AI progress, instead of usurping U.S. strength, might in fact be the beginning of a reordering—a step, in other words, toward a future where, instead of a hegemonic power, there are many competing centers of AI power. “China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent [for example] a war,” wrote Miles Brundage, a former OpenAI policy staffer, on X. “So unless you want (literal) war, you need to have a vision for navigating multipolar AI outcomes.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: The AI-stock wipeout lays bare 2 risks investors have been happy to ignore — until now

Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:06:33Z
Full Content:
A new artificial intelligence tool from a startup in China has sent shockwaves across the US tech sector, with the cheaper AI model trained on older chips forcing investors to confront two big risks to the market. DeepSeek joined the AI race in recent days, sparking a big sell-off to start the week as investors faced concerns about risks that had largely been glossed over while the bull rally continued for the last two years — namely, risks associated with stretched tech-stock valuations and enormous spending by some of the biggest tech firms as they pursue their AI ambitions. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell sharply Monday morning, down 1.8% and 3.2% around noon ET. Semiconductor stocks faced the steepest losses, while tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet also dropped. The debut of the DeepSeek AI tool blindsided investors who have been willing to accept the tech sector's historically stretched valuations as justified since the bull market took off in 2022. The new AI app is also likely forcing tough questions about AI spending by the cloud "hyperscalers" that have pursued ambitious AI programs in the last few years. Overnight, it's become much harder to shrug off two big risks to the stock market's dominant narrative. Chatter about a possible correction has risen, but has still mostly been confined to the fringes of Wall Street's consensus views. The market has predicted another strong year for stocks, even after the S&P 500 hit more than 50 records in 2024 and posted a second year of 25% gains. With help from the AI investing frenzy, the Magnificent Seven stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla — have surged, and account for over a third of the value of the S&P 500. Writing in a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts said that of the 20 valuation metrics they track, 19 were sitting at extreme levels. The S&P 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 25.3 times, for example, is 70% above its 125-year average of about 15 times. Valuation metrics like that have been easy to accept while the market's biggest stocks faced little outside competition and could woo investors with promises of the transformative power of new technology. But DeepSeek is now laying bare the danger that the US market has been overvalued. As its AI tool undercuts OpenAI on pricing, outperforms leading US peers, and is being trained on older and cheaper Nvidia GPUs, tech valuations are in doubt. That's evident in the plunge in the price of Nvidia stock on Monday. The chip titan, which reclaimed the title of the world's most valuable company from Apple last week, dropped as much as 18% and was headed for a loss that would mark the worst market-cap wipeout in history. Broadcom fell more than 17% and Taiwan Semiconductor Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was down more than 14% at midday. "What makes Monday's tech selloff so jarring is that the valuations of many of these AI and tech companies offer no margin of error," David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, said in written commentary. "Excessive valuation always becomes a problem, eventually, but fundamental news becomes a heightened problem when it is combined with excessive valuation." The tech meltdown could also lead to a painful reckoning among investors over high spending among the "hyperscalers" — companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms — that have poured billions of dollars into AI to further build out cloud computing capabilities. Morgan Stanley estimated at the end of last year that Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft would collectively see $300 billion in AI capital expenditures through 2025, with even bigger figures to come in 2026. Before that, Bernstein projected that Big Tech capex on data centers and real estate would exceed $1 trillion over five years. Microsoft alone said it would spend $80 billion this year on AI data centers. "These high and rising capex numbers again speak to the importance of continued disclosure about new/incremental adoption, engagement, and revenue opportunities each of the four companies are seeing and investing in," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last November. Investors had been getting somewhat anxious to start seeing a return on this spending, but have largely still been willing to tolerate it as long as earnings growth continued. Bullish analysts had argued that heavy spending was required to fuel a profitable AI boom over the next decade. However, DeepSeek is challenging this view. For one, the AI tool is trained on cheaper Nvidia H800 chips, as the US government has restricted the sale of some of the company's most advanced GPUs to China. The fact that a cutting-edge AI app has been developed with last-gen tech may damage the thesis that companies need to spend more and more on high-powered GPUs to keep up. This has sparked some discussions about future demand for Nvidia's more expensive hardware. "While there is a contention that DeepSeek's efficient training methods could reduce the demand for high-end Nvidia GPUs, potentially affecting sales, it is also plausible that the more cost-effective approach will result in more demand for hardware for those looking to train proprietary models," wrote Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital. While the market's tech panic has revived dormant issues concerning valuations and spending, Bernstein analysts said on Monday that the reaction may be overblown. Analysts at Jefferies, meanwhile, suggested reduced exposure to semiconductor supply chains while the impact becomes more clear. Investors are also bracing for tech earnings to begin this week, and DeepSeek has raised the stakes for mega-cap results. While strong Big Tech earnings have been a catalyst for fresh gains, DeepSeek could spoil the party this time. "We do not expect big tech earnings over the next two weeks to help justify the sector's elevated valuations. These companies may very well report a wonderful quarter, and they may guide higher for intended orders and revenue expectations. Current valuations do not factor in the risks of competition, which seems inevitable, and risks of diminished order books in the future, and all the other reasons that lofty valuations eventually revert to the mean," he wrote. Importantly, the broader stock market's fate in 2025 might hinge on the performance of the Magnificent Seven. At the end of last year, Bank of America said that the elite group must keep winning to avoid spurring a wider market correction. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: DeepSeek's cheaper models and weaker chips call into question trillions in AI infrastructure spending

The bombshell that is China's DeepSeek model has set the AI ecosystem alight. The models are high-performing, relatively cheap, and compute-efficient, which has led many to posit that they pose an existential threat to American companies like OpenAI and Meta — and the trillions of dollars going into building, improving, and scaling US AI infrastructure. The price of DeepSeek's open-source model is competitive — 20 to 40 times cheaper to run than comparable models from OpenAI, Bernstein analysts said. But the potentially more nerve-racking element in the DeepSeek equation for US-built models is the relatively modest hardware stack used to build them. The DeepSeek-V3 model, which is most comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT, was trained on a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to the technical report published by the company. H800s are the first version of the company's defeatured chip for the Chinese market. After the regulations were amended, the company made another defeatured chip, the H20 to comply with the changes. Though this may not always be the case, chips are the most substantial cost in the large language model training equation. Being forced to use less powerful, cheaper chips created a constraint that the DeepSeek team has ostensibly overcome. "Innovation under constraints takes genius," Sri Ambati, the CEO of the open-source AI platform H2O.ai, told Business Insider. Even on subpar hardware, training DeepSeek-V3 took less than two months, the company's report said. DeepSeek-V3 is small relative to its capabilities and has 671 billion parameters, while ChatGPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, which makes it easier to run. But DeepSeek-V3 still hits impressive benchmarks of understanding. Its smaller size comes in part by using a different architecture than ChatGPT, called a "mixture of experts." The model has pockets of expertise built in, which go into action when called upon and sit dormant when irrelevant to the query. This type of model is growing in popularity, and DeepSeek's advantage is that it built an extremely efficient version of an inherently efficient architecture. "Someone made this analogy: It's almost as if someone released a $20 iPhone," Jared Quincy Davis, the CEO of Foundry, told BI. The Chinese model used a fraction of the time, a fraction of the number of chips, and a less capable, less expensive chip cluster. Essentially, it's a drastically cheaper, competitively capable model that the firm is virtually giving away for free. Bernstein analysts said that DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model more comparable to OpenAI's o1 or o3, is even more concerning from a competitive standpoint. This model uses reasoning techniques to interrogate its own responses and thinking, similar to OpenAI's latest reasoning models. R1 was built on top of V3, but the research paper released with the more advanced model doesn't include information about the hardware stack behind it. DeepSeek used strategies like generating its own training data to train R1, which requires more compute than using data scraped from the internet or generated by humans. This technique is often referred to as "distillation" and is becoming standard practice, Ambati said. Distillation brings with it another layer of controversy, though. A company using its own models to distill a smarter, smaller model is one thing. But the legality of using other company's models to distill new ones depends on licensing. Still, DeepSeek's techniques are more iterative and likely to be taken up by the AI indsutry immediately. For years, model developers and startups have focused on smaller models since their size makes them cheaper to build and operate. The thinking was that small models would serve specific tasks. But what DeepSeek and potentially OpenAI's o3 mini demonstrate is that small models can also be generalists. A coalition of players including Oracle and OpenAI, with cooperation from the White House, announced Stargate, a $500 billion data center project in Texas — the latest in a quick procession of developments in large-scale conversion to accelerated computing. DeepSeek's surprise release has called that investment into question, and Nvidia, the largest beneficiary of the investment, is on a roller coaster as a result. The company's stock plummeted more than 13% Monday. But Bernstein said the response is out of step with the reality. "DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for $5M'," Bernstein analysts wrote in a Monday investor note. The panic, especially on X, is blown out of proportion, the analysts said. DeepSeek's own research paper on V3 says: "The aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data." So the $5 million figure is only part of the equation. "The models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles," Bernstein continued. Last week China also announced a roughly $140 billion investment in data centers, in a sign that infrastructure is still needed despite DeepSeek's achievements. The competition for model supremacy is fierce, and OpenAI's moat may indeed be in question. But demand for chips shows no signs of slowing, Bernstein said. Tech leaders are circling back to a centuries-old economic adage to explain the moment. The Jevons paradox is the idea that innovation begets demand. As technology gets cheaper or more efficient, demand increases much faster than prices drop. That's what providers of computing power, such as Foundry's Jared Quincy Davis, have been espousing for years. This week, Bernstein and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella picked up the mantle, too. "Jevons paradox strikes again!" Nadella posted on X Monday morning. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal Policies Set A New Tone For Business

Plus: UnitedMasters CEO On Pivoting Recording To Tech, Lack Of Tariffs Kept Markets Steady, How Federal Return-To-Office Policy Could Impact The Private Sector, OpenAI Unveils A Smooth Operator What a difference a week can make. Last Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president. In seven days, executive orders and policy pronouncements have shaken the U.S. and countries globally as he is changing how the United States government does business in terms of employment, immigration policy, criminal justice and diplomacy. And while shifts in the federal government’s internal operations don’t necessarily impact how the private sector runs, it sets a tone, and could inspire businesses to make changes. One of the most prevalent policy shifts is in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. An executive order signed on the first day of Trump’s presidency ends federal DEI programs, saying that “illegal and immoral” plans in every government department intended to ensure better representation of genders, races and backgrounds throughout government “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” DEI initiatives throughout the government were formally shut down two days later, and employees who worked in DEI offices were immediately put on paid leave. According to a memo, each department is to plan for staff reductions for DEI employees by January 31. Another executive order from Trump brings this crackdown to the private sector. He rescinded a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson, requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. Even before Trump took office, popularity of DEI initiatives among businesses was already waning. Last week, Target scaled back some of its policies, phasing out its goals to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women, pulling its participation from external diversity surveys, phasing out anti-racism training, and shifting its supplier diversity team to focus on supplier engagement. But some companies are digging in on diversity. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. The fight over diversity will continue to play out everywhere, and how policies will ultimately be decided is unclear. Time—as well as future measures of the broader economy, company offerings and demographic statistics—will tell. One thing that has remained constant, regardless of who’s in the White House, is technology’s disruption of more traditional industries. The music business has seen a lot of change over the last generation. I talked to Steve Stoute, a former record company executive who founded the tech-enabled and creator-empowering enterprise UnitedMasters. I talked to him about his path to reinventing an old industry. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after speaking at a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. One thing that didn’t see a ton of change the week Trump took office: the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all moved up less than three points last week, with a bump last Tuesday—the first day of trading in Trump’s second term—and small ups and downs through Friday, largely from earnings reports and other more normal business indicators. A key reason for less volatility in trading is that Trump has held back on putting tariffs in place. He’s threatened tariffs on several nations—Canada and Mexico starting February 1, on Russia if it doesn’t end the war with Ukraine, higher ones for China if it doesn’t cooperate with the sale of TikTok, and on Colombia over not accepting deportees. If and when tariffs actually are announced and prices are likely to change, markets may see bigger swings. The economy is on many peoples’ minds, but consumers are still spending. The National Retail Federation reported that November and December retail sales were a record $994.1 billion, 4% higher than 2023, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Holiday spending exceeded predictions of 2.5% to 3.5% growth. But this growth wasn’t just for the holiday season. Sales for 2024 as a whole grew a record 3.6% to a record $5.28 trillion, the NRF found. The growth is expected to continue, Deloitte reported in its 2025 retail industry outlook, Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon wrote. The firm predicts that consumer spending will grow by 3.1% in 2025. While this level of spending might be good for business bottom lines, it might not be the best thing for the economy as a whole. In Q3, credit card balances nationwide hit $1.17 trillion—an increase of $24 billion—and 3.5% of all household debt was in some form of delinquency, according to statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Consumer confidence also is declining, with the Conference Board seeing a drop of 8.1 points in December. The expectations index—based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and the labor market—fell 12.6 points to 81.1, just above 80, which usually is a benchmark for a coming recession. getty Another big change for federal workers that may bleed into the private sector: An end to most remote work. Trump signed an executive order mandating federal employees work in the office five days a week. Forbes contributor Terina Allen writes that most of the government’s 2.3 million civilian employees—about 54%—work entirely on-site already, and just 10% work entirely remotely. Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes that this new policy is likely to also make employees quit government jobs, bringing de facto cuts to the size of the federal workforce. This new policy could have a trickle-down effect on the private sector, with more employers—who have wanted more employees spending more time in the office anyway—making the same moves themselves. However, there could be some downsides to following the federal government’s lead. It might ultimately damage workplace culture, making employees feel like they are not trusted, career expert Jasmine Escalera of MyPerfectResume told HR Executive. Meanwhile, some remote-work-friendly executives told MarketWatch that they plan to capitalize on the federal government’s move, attracting highly qualified candidates with a more flexible work environment. They said that the benefits of remote work are clear, and this plan is a step backward. Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Politics aside—even though Trump tried to make some of it political—some big advancements in AI were announced in the last week. On the apolitical front, OpenAI unveiled its “Operator” AI assistant. The company described this tool as an “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you,” completing tasks including making online grocery orders and ticket purchases, downloading lectures, combining PDFs and calculating refunds. It isn’t totally autonomous, and asks users for confirmation before tasks like sending emails or completing orders. It is first be available in a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users. On the potentially political end of the spectrum, Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI infrastructure partnership called “Stargate” between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. This partnership will build several state-of-the-art AI data centers across the U.S. to expand computing power for new developments in the tech space. It’s the type of project Biden had prioritized, signing an executive order before he left office, the Washington Post reported, and that OpenAI had been lobbying for. The Stargate project could help the U.S. keep its lead in AI development, as long as it can figure out several key issues detailed by Forbes contributor Emil Sayegh, including who’s in charge of the sprawling initiative, how data centers will get the electricity they need, and where highly skilled workers who can operate these centers will come from. (Musk has also questioned how solid SoftBank’s funding may be, though it’s unclear if his trolling merely stems from his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.) Not to be outdone, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Friday plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year, with much of that going to AI efforts. Zuckerberg said the company will expand AI teams significantly, and predicted the company’s Llama 4 large language model will become “the leading state-of-the-art” AI model this year. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about reinventing a legacy business for today’s tech landscape. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What kind of knowledge and background did you bring to founding UnitedMasters from your years in the traditional recording industry? How did you pivot your expertise? Stoute: I’ve been in the business since ’91. It had gone through such a bad time since MP3s hit, and then it started to migrate into iTunes. Artists had lost. They didn’t know where the revenue was, what the business would be. It was a period of eight years of decline, decline of market share, and no one had a clue what the solution would be. When iTunes came, the good news was that people were paying for music again. The bad news was the price of it was so low, the delta between what it was and what it is going to be was so far off that people had to readjust to these new economics. That’s why you started to see the rise of merch and other items being sold. It was like, ‘Okay, I can’t monetize the music, so let me monetize the higher margin item like a T-shirt or a hoodie.’ Everybody had gotten into that business because there was no more money left just selling records. To me, that was a very clear path, and I wanted to use my understanding of the business and my access to technology. I worked very closely with Ben Horowitz [of Andreessen Horowitz]. He’s on the board of my company. I wanted to work very closely with technology to help build what would be the technical solve for the music business of the future. What advice would you give to an aspiring CEO or leader like you were: They have deep knowledge of a traditional business but they want to start something new that adapts to the times we’re in now? When you’re beginning, ideas don’t come out fully formed and they only become clear as you work on them. You really just have to get started. This whole idea that there’s this eureka moment and then all of a sudden it hits you is actually a dangerous lie. Because you feel like until you have that eureka moment, you’re not prepared to do anything, so you are waiting for this lightning to strike, that never strikes. The key is to move forward with that commitment, so that beautiful journey becomes clear. How did it happen for you? How did you get from feeling that you wanted to do something in this space to building it into UnitedMasters? When I look back at it, in hindsight, I was actually going through a very tough time in my life. Jay-Z and [Interscope Records cofounder and longtime CEO] Jimmy Iovine were both leaving the [traditional] music industry. Jimmy was building a company called Beats Music, which ended up becoming Apple Music, and Jay-Z had bought this [music streaming] company called Tidal. I’m like, if those guys are going into the streaming business, what that means to me is that distribution as we knew it is fully dead. That they’ve accepted that Spotify had no competitors. I’m like, if they’re gone and they’re going after Spotify because they have no competitors, what that means is that the barrier for artists to get to distribution was no longer going to be physical and capital intensive. Those are just two data points that I had. I took those two data points and began to put together an idea that became UnitedMasters. It was certainly not when I was on my front foot. I wasn’t doing great. It wasn’t the optimum time to have an idea, but I kept on thinking about the idea. As I got better, and I became more who I already am, I was like, this is not a good idea. This is a great idea. It’s the future. What I didn’t know was how early I was going to be, and I would reckon to you I was too early. But when you speak to the great VCs, they’ll tell you the gift and the curse of being early is: When you’re early, when you have vision, you see it early, and when you see it early, it just takes longer to happen. So don’t feel bad for being early. If you see it early, that means your vision is really good. Get prepared for the long run, pack enough clothes—AKA get the funding you need, get people who believe in your vision, because it’s going to be a minute. Always stay sharpening your vision because it’s going to happen in iterations over time. You’ve got to always be able to modify as conditions change. The baseline truth won’t change, but some things around it may change. Mergers and acquisitions, new technologies, all these things. You’ve got to be able to be committed to your vision, but yet nimble enough to do what you’ve got to do as things evolve. DeepSeek, a Chinese firm that released an AI model that runs on less powerful chips than those used by OpenAI—but has been able to match its first model on certain benchmarks—caused a tech stock selloff as markets opened Monday. 3.5%: Drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq at Monday’s open 12%: Opening decline for chip maker Nvidia ‘May be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible’: What JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande wrote investors could be thinking right now about the AI investment cycle When a business goes through a crisis situation, it could be devastating.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? China Shocks AI Industry With 'Sputnik Moment'

Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI model that is sending shockwaves through the US tech industry due to its low cost and high performance. Tech investor Marc Andreessen calls it "AI's Sputnik moment," causing US tech stocks to tumble this morning, with Nvidia the hardest hit, down 11%. The app surpassed ChatGPT on the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free application. But after receiving a flood of registrations and "large-scale malicious attacks"—possibly a DDoS attack—DeepSeek has "temporarily" restricted access to those with a +86 mainland Chinese phone number. You may still be able to sign in with a Google account. We downloaded it from the app store before this, and found the interface nearly identical to ChatGPT. It currently has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, as shown in the screenshot below. But the big game-changer is not the chatbot experience but the open-source model that powers it on the backend. It appears to be the highest-performing available for an ultra-low price. Being open source, anyone with the right skills can download it and use it. The model, dubbed R1, came out on Jan. 20, a few months after DeepSeek released its first model. The company says its performance is "on par with OpenAI-o1,” the model OpenAI debuted in September 2024 with the ability to follow a chain of thought. The company called the approach a "new paradigm" that would bring AI models closer to human-level intelligence. Looking at the pricing specs for the DeepSeek R1 reasoner model and OpenAI's GPT-o1, you'll see R1 is a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek charges $2.19 per 1 million output tokens, compared to $60 for GPT-o1. Even OpenAI's mini version of GPT-o1, which is intended to be a lightweight, more affordable version, costs $12. Like DeepSeek, Meta has made open source its central AI strategy with its Llama models, which are currently free. "To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think, 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong," says Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Threads. "The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.'" Meta has set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek’s technology, focusing on how the company reduced training costs and what data it may have used, according to The Information. There is some controversy over the chips that power R1. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old businessman, reportedly stocked up on Nvidia A100 chips before they were banned from export to China in September 2022. DeepSeek claims R1 runs on lower-capacity Nvidia H800 chips, but it's difficult to know exactly what is going on behind closed doors, especially since A100 chips are still being snuck into China in violation of US sanctions. "Rather than weakening China’s AI capabilities, the sanctions appear to be driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration," says the MIT Technology Review. The constrained chip supply may have forced the company to place a premium on efficient computing from the start of development. More efficient computing also means less energy use—a welcome innovation given AI's astronomical energy needs. Why has Nvidia's stock price tumbled, even though DeepSeek is still using its chips? Because its AI model does more with less. US tech companies are now coming under fire for a potentially bloated approach to AI development, requiring more and more chips, while being less efficient with them than DeepSeek appears to be. Last week, President Donald Trump announced that Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank would spearhead a $500 billion investment in AI data centers with the Stargate Project. Data collection is another concern with DeepSeek. Like TikTok, the company is obligated to share user data with the Chinese government if it requests it. The privacy policy lists the data it collects, and how it will use it, including to "comply with our legal obligations." As an open-source platform, that means US companies may feed it their data in addition to everyday chatbot users. I'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

Title: DeepSeek Surges on App Store: What Is the Chinese AI Model and Why Is It a Big Deal?
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/deepseek-what-is-it-chinese-artificial-intelligence-model/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T16:52:19Z

China’s artificial intelligence company jumped past OpenAI’s ChatGPT on the Apple App Store after releasing two new models DeepSeek sent shock waves through the artificial intelligence world this past weekend and Wall Street on Monday. If you follow the tech industry even sparingly — or happened to jump on X or the App Store recently — you likely saw the name. But what is DeepSeek, and what is the big deal all about? Let’s jump into it. For starters, DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company and research lab that creates open-source large language models, or LLMs. Open-source LLMs are AI models that allow others to build on its technology. X’s Grok and Meta’s Llama are some other well-known open-source LLMs, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular closed-source LLM. Why Is It In the News? DeepSeek released its R1 and R1-Zero reasoning models on Jan. 20, and their capabilities quickly gained notice in the tech and AI worlds. In particular, there are two key aspects to DeepSeek’s latest releases: 1) Refined Reinforcement DeepSeek’s model uses a technique called Reinforcement — where a model makes decisions to achieve a certain goal — that goes beyond other models. That is because it does not use human feedback to refine itself, which other models do. As Ben Thompson of the tech-focused Stratechery blog put it succinctly: “LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc… R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning.” 2) Distillation Another important factor here is DeepSeek’s distillation technique. Distillation is where a smaller model like DeepSeek is able to lift the information from larger models, while also using less memory and computing power. This also helps cut down on costs. DeepSeek said its recent breakthroughs cost less than $6 million and took less than two months to build. Why Is This a Big Deal? From a macro standpoint, it shows that China — remember, China’s communist government is closely linked to all of its companies, especially the major tech firms that branch out into different markets — is further along in AI innovation than many had thought. And DeepSeek’s performance is particularly noteworthy, given its low cost and its ability to navigate around chip restrictions that were rolled out by former President Joe Biden. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, called it AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. Competitors DeepSeek has crashed an already-crowded AI space. It leapfrogged ChatGPT in the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free app this weekend, indicating there is strong user interest in what DeepSeek can do. Many analysts believe DeepSeek, and what is means about Chinese AI capabilities, was the main reason the U.S. stock market was down on Monday morning, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.72% in the first 90 minutes of trading. Meta, which announced on Friday it would be investing $60 billion-$65 billion to fuel its AI business, was not hit by the Monday drop, with its share price climbing about 1.5% in early trading. Google, which has its own AI model, Gemini, did see its stock price drop about 2.5%, while Tesla was down 1%, although its business is obviously more than just its AI component. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner, saw its stock price drop 3.7%. The biggest hit was to Nvidia, which supplies chips and other important tech that undergirds AI development. Its stock price was down 14.8% in the first hour and a half of trading on Monday. Censorship? To reinforce that DeepSeek is ultimately beholden to China’s government, many noted this weekend that its model will not answer certain questions on topics the CCP is not a fan of — like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. This is similar to how TheWrap recently found “Little Red Book,” aka “RedNote,” would censor content about Tiananmen Square or China’s treatment of the Uyghurs.

Title: Investors betting on the Trump trade may be missing some real risks

I'm back! Fresh off my trip to Davos I'm jumping right into it. DeepSeek's AI models are spooking tech stocks this morning. The Chinese AI lab has been rolling out new models in recent weeks, and they're cheaper than rival OpenAI's. DeepSeek's models are open-source, which means they're available for anyone who wants to use them for free. That's a challenge to OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary, and charges premium prices for them. In a paper released last Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of "reasoning" — and it has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned. DeepSeek hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store's Top Free Apps Chart days later. It's the latest disruption in AI, and markets are feeling the shock, with Nvidia down by more than 10% premarket on Monday. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, we're focusing on investors' exuberance over the new administration has some wondering if people are getting ahead of themselves. What's on deck Markets: Multistrat hedge funds just can't quit Manhattan. Tech: VC Twitter has found a new love — LinkedIn. Business: Breakfast isn't getting cheaper anytime soon thanks to the price of eggs. But first, hot out the gates. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There are plenty of uncertainties with the new administration. How investors feel about Donald Trump's pro-business agenda isn't one of them. Stocks reached record highs during the president's first week in office, and there's plenty of hope that it's just the beginning. Trump's consistent message of deregulation and lower corporate taxes has investors excited about the resulting growth potential. Some in the market, however, aren't as convinced. Business Insider's Jennifer Sor has a story on how investors might be wearing Trump-tinted glasses that are hiding some real risks. Much of the concern stems from persistently high interest rates, worries that were pushed aside last week as investors focused on Trump's pro-growth agenda. And while the aggressiveness of Trump's tariff policy remains unclear, many believe it will eventually push inflation higher, further dampening views of stimulative rate cuts. While the market has elected to look past elevated rates, the ever-important 10-year Treasury yield crept up as much as 13 basis points during the four-day week. The US market has the benefit of somewhat being the only game in town, though. European economies are in a much weaker position than the US, which dents the future earnings potential of companies there. And the threat of more regulation makes them even less inviting. China's economy, meanwhile, is struggling to mount a comeback. It's also one of Trump's biggest foreign targets. And while there's always a chance of reconciliation, that's a risky bet. Still, the US stock market is heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech names, which some see as a looming risk. Albert Edwards, a famously bearish strategist, shared three charts that illustrate how top-heavy things are, writes BI's Will Edwards. But investors seem willing to keep betting on the US. Meanwhile, with only one term to implement his plan, Trump has no time to waste. That means businesses (and the people investing in them) will just need to prepare for a bit of a bumpy ride. BI's John L. Dorman, Brent D. Griffiths, and Bryan Metzger have a breakdown of all the shockwaves Trump has already sent through corporate America during his first week. Trump and Musk are at odds again. This time over the UK prime minister. 1. New York City is still the center of the hedge fund universe. Despite interest in sunnier places like Miami, regulatory filings reveal most portfolio managers at multistrategy hedge funds work from the Big Apple. That includes funds like Balyasny, Citadel, and Point72, which are headquartered elsewhere. 2. Inside the routine and leadership style of a Citadel partner. Micah Nance runs a team of nine analysts and associates that covers about 150 tech and media companies out of the hedge fund's Dallas office. He spoke to BI about his 13 years climbing the ranks at the high-profile firm, how he manages his time, and some career advice. 3. Here come the crypto hires. The market and regulators are both getting behind digital assets again. As a result, both fintechs and traditional finance firms are staffing up. 1. The Zuckermoon is over. The Meta CEO was on the precipice of becoming cool after his major makeover and "wife guy" revamp. But he's lost brownie points with some since dealing blows to Meta's fact-checking system, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. The comments section — and even AI's opinion — is ruthless. 2. The buzz around voice AI. The tech isn't new, but investors are excited about its vast use cases and recent rapid sophistication. BI spoke to investors about the untapped opportunities they see in the sector, from real-time audio transcriptions to generating synthetic voices. 3. VC Twitter takes LinkedIn. Though X remains the platform of choice for venture capitalists, they're starting to post more on LinkedIn. VCs told BI they see better "ROI" on their posts on the workplace social-networking site, and that it's where business can actually get done. 1. Cheap eggs aren't on the horizon. Bird flu isn't going anywhere, and it's limiting supply. Meanwhile, a surge in consumer "egg-citement" is driving demand. A push to treat chickens better isn't cheap, either — and it's all reflected in the current egg prices. 2. Eli Lilly's weight-loss wonders. The Mounjaro and Zepbound producer hopes to close the gap with competitor Novo Nordisk's Ozempic — and take things a step further. Eli Lilly's head of obesity teased a pill to rival Ozempic and a triple-threat "King Kong" injection to mimic bariatric surgery. The ultimate dream: a once-per-year weight-loss shot. 3. Gen Z is already fed up with work — and it's not about laziness. Less than a third of young American workers felt engaged at their job last year, a report from Gallup found. The younger generation hasn't wasted time taking a transactional view of work, BI's Aki Ito wrote. However, with low engagement costing businesses $9 trillion a year worldwide, employers need to step it up. I'm the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. These seven lessons have shaped my success.

Title: Truth Social: On the Still-Human Films of Sohrab Hura

The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). “We are excited to announce insulin is free now.” At first glance, this November 2022 Twitter post from @EliLillyandCo appeared to be a legitimate announcement from the pharmaceutical company; the account’s profile featured an icon of Eli Lilly and Company’s logo and a blue check mark that, until the previous day, signified the account had been formally verified by the platform’s dedicated staff. But in the hands of new owner Elon Musk, who completed his acquisition of the platform two weeks earlier, Twitter’s verification process underwent significant modification. Suddenly, verification was available to anyone with an authenticated phone number and a willingness to pay $8 a month for the platform’s Premium plan. Twitter, soon to be rebranded as X, inevitably descended into chaos, rife with impersonators and misinformation. Eli Lilly’s stock share price fell by 4.37 percent in one day. What, above all, this episode seemed to signal was the breakdown of institutional responsibility. Prioritizing revenue over accountability, Twitter abandoned any pretense that it would be an arbiter of authenticity; Meta recently followed suit, announcing on January 7 of this year that it would be ditching its fact-checkers in favor of a crowdsourced system of community notes. In our era of “post-truth” politics, images and videos have become laden with new economies of meaning, not all of them based in fact. Social media platforms, as we have seen time and time again, are not neutral mediators but actively influence the reception of content—whether by amplifying certain narratives through algorithmic promotion, stripping or adding context via content labels, or allowing virality to determine credibility. You’ll find a similar line of interest in the crisp, hyper-saturated pictures of the Indian photographer and filmmaker Sohrab Hura, whose recent projects take up a study of synthetic images and how they are distributed. He began working this way as a direct response to the 2004 Indian election, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ultranationalism and “India Shining” slogan aimed to project an image of an economically strong and empowered country—one far from the reality lived by many Indians, especially those in rural areas. Returning to power in 2014 with Narendra Modi as prime minister, the BJP undertook an even more aggressive campaign of propaganda and distortion. V. K. Singh, a cabinet minister, has referred to journalists as “presstitutes.” Modi claims to have once worked as a humble tea seller on a railway platform, though a 2015 Right to Information query cast doubt on his story. Campaign video for Manoj Tiwari, a BJP candidate for parliament, appears to show him speaking English and Haryanvi, the latter a direct appeal to Delhi’s large population of migrant workers. When it was revealed that the original speech was in Hindi, and that the other versions were AI-assisted deepfakes, the BJP dismissed the episode as an experiment. Sohrab Hura, Remains of the day, 2024. Soft pastel on paper. Courtesy of the artist and Experimenter, Kolkata and Mumbai. Surreal times call for surrealist art. Mother, now on view at MoMA PS1 in New York, is the first US survey of Hura’s work. It orchestrates a kaleidoscope of images and sounds, plunging viewers into a maelstrom of ambiguity where truth is indistinguishable from fiction. Single-channel videos flash and whir, suffused with a palpable anxiety. His lurid pastel illustrations and paintings in gouache and acrylics show some fidelity to photography, composed like snapshots or selfies. Together, these varied forms of practice seem to ask if some mediums are more inclined to capture reality than others. In Mother, we find not just Hura’s inquiry into the self, but into his motherland. Things Felt but Not Quite Expressed, a collection of Hura’s illustrations with sardonically self-referential titles, was created between 2022 and 2024, when he was experiencing a disconnect from the fixed nature of photography, moving from image to illustration to capture the idiosyncrasies of quotidian life in an increasingly polarized world. A meme of a French bulldog captioned “Men over 35 in skinny jeans”; impressionistic lashings of bright color; a portrait of a refugee Palestinian couple lying idly in a Syrian field—the art of Things Felt is by turns dreamy, hilarious, and deeply moving. It also speaks to Hura’s recent efforts to consolidate emotional truth into his images. Photographic glitches allow Hura to explore the manipulation and distortion of meaning in a world increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven images. A glitch could be as simple as the warping of a scanned photo, or the telltale signs of some crude Photoshopping. (Think of the hysteria that Princess Catherine’s doctored Mother’s Day photo caused earlier this year and the very meme-able apology that followed: “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”) Hura views these glitches as “fault lines of doubt,” spaces that allow new layers of understanding to emerge.1 They “have this ability to give us a sense of the real in an increasingly fake world," he explains, pointing to the onslaught of edited images we are exposed to daily.2 As AI and algorithms generate more viral content, he believes the future of photography and film lies in these mistakes and accidents, indissoluble from human nature. The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). Hura works to draw out that fluidity in his films, too. In The Lost Head and the Bird (2018), the artist induces sensory overload through a rapid-fire montage of found footage—images of Bollywood stars, right-wing propaganda, and bloody violence—all interleaved with Hura’s own photographs. The intensity of this visual barrage is amplified by a frenetic soundtrack by Hannes d’Hoine and Sjoerd Bruil, which disrupts our ability to accurately interpret what we see. The film takes its name from the surreal one-page story and photo series published in Hura’s book The Coast (2019), which introduces Madhu, a pitiful woman whose head was stolen by a jealous ex-lover as her pet bird escaped its cage. In the film, a fortune teller sells Madhu a crow, having convinced her that it’s a parrot with a bad cough. The final character in the story, Hura explains, is himself: the photographer, complicit in this violence and deception. In implicating himself, he also implicates the viewer in this voyeurism, claiming that “both of us are helping circulate these images,” blurring the lines between participant and observer.3 Watching The Lost Head is a borderline hallucinatory experience. An iteration of the project for MoMA in 2021 featured twelve versions of the film accompanied by unnerving short stories, each a slight variation of the one that came before. By subtly changing our understanding of Madhu in each retelling, Hura plays with our instinct to trust photographic images and escalates the viewer’s confusion. Confounding any notion of objectivity, he evinces how meaning can be warped not just by manipulating images but also through the sequencing of information. The Coast (Sohrab Hura, 2020). Using footage and stills taken after religious celebrations in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu, The Coast (2020) retains this slightly surreal quality, though its narrative is far more tightly controlled. The project began as a photobook in 2018, and the film develops the original concept by embracing a plurality of forms, using the margin between land and water as a point of release to explore the undercurrents of religious, sexual, and caste-related violence along India’s coastline. The intimate footage transitions from sacred communal fervor to quiet, unsettling moments of post-festival reflection, in which bodies and spaces take on an otherworldly quality. Once again, Hura manipulates context by covertly adding and removing details to blur lines between reality and artifice; his harsh, unforgiving flash creates visuals that mirror the fragmented, fetishistic language of social media images. In The Coast, this litany is brought to life by shots of India’s shoreline, deployed throughout Hura’s work as a metaphor for a society on the brink of collapse. But here, the sea also manifests as a site of religious ritual as demonic masquerades, bloodletting, scenes of destitution, deformity, and anguish unfold. At first, the lapping waves seethe with libidinal energy, then the film gradually transitions to more serene images of darkened figures diving into the ocean, submitting to its primal force. This climactic moment, when the sea collides with grainy, ecstatic bodies, offers them release from artifice in their heightened psychospiritual state. As Hura puts it, “nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming.” While The Lost Head islaced with references to Ganesha, The Coast affects allusions to religion more literally as festivalgoers masquerade as different deities, entering a trancelike frenzy as their bodies hit the water, which washes away their face paint. Hura explains that in India, “perhaps more so than anywhere else, fiction, stories … live longer than factual stories. They are allegories that people return to, constants in the ongoing turbulence of politics, religion, and caste.”4 This idea of enduring allegories seems especially pertinent in a time when religious narratives are increasingly distorted and weaponized. The BJP, for example, has made incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric integral to its political strategy. During the 2024 election, the party explicitly framed themselves as defenders of Hindu interests, portraying Muslims as an external threat. In May 2024, civil and corporate watchdog groups submitted fake advertisements to Meta as a test of their filtering mechanisms: one proclaimed that “Hindu blood is spilling, these invaders must be burned,” while another called for the execution of a rival political leader. Both were approved to appear on Facebook and Instagram. Pati (Sohrab Hura, 2010). Given Hura’s deliberate shift away from aesthetic objectivity in recent years, it’s interesting that his earlier work is marked by an earnest confidence in film’s potential for truth-telling. His first film, Pati (2010), is an eleven-minute black-and-white documentary featuring barren landscapes—the aftermath of deforestation and deprivation—in the village of Pati, Madhya Pradesh. Collating photos taken in 2005, the projectchronicles the final push from activists, students, academics, journalists, and artists campaigning for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act: a landmark bill that, once implemented, guaranteed 100 days per year of minimum-wage employment for all adult members of a rural household. One particularly moving scene shows children working at a construction site. “Life is not the easiest for [them],” says Hura in voice-over. “There is no respite for anyone over here, and any hand is a helping hand, no matter how small it is.” Pati’s framing of children’s resilience here shares an edifying quality with Francis Alÿs’s Children’s Games video series (1999–), which also looks to make sense of injustice through the eyes of the innocent. While Alÿs films with an anthropological closeness, Hura instead draws attention to his role as the “idiot photographer”: a spectator all too aware of his role in the complicity and cruelty required to make such images.5 Yet his self-awareness doesn’t necessarily absolve him; by foregrounding his own position, Hura risks turning ethical scrutiny into an aesthetic device, one that allows the film to acknowledge its own voyeurism without disrupting it. In this way, Pati becomes complicit in the very structures of image-making it seeks to expose. Bittersweet (Sohrab Hura, 2019). In an earlier short, Bittersweet (2019), Hura initially resisted this impulse to question the ethical place of the photographer. Documenting Hura’s life over ten years, the film focuses on his mother—diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia when he was seventeen—and her relationship with her dog, Elsa. Here, his discomfort was more personal, shaped by his dual role as both son and photographer. Looking back on the film in 2019, he explained his early reluctance to share this work: I didn’t want to feel vulnerable. I didn’t want others to look at her in pity or shock. At the time I had thought that I was being protective of her, but I soon realized that I was actually being protective of myself. How they might have looked at my mother would also define how they looked at me and that scared me. But how could I continue to parachute into someone else’s life and photograph another mother when I couldn’t photograph my own? I had started to feel sure that I needed to turn the camera on myself. I felt that I needed to earn my right to photograph someone else’s life by first putting my own out there with nothing held back.6 In that sense, Bittersweet functions like an eerie family album: grainy, overexposed photos overlaid with discordant sounds, produced by transforming light exposure readings of the scanned photos into sound frequencies. Like synaptic connections, the images weave together fragments of his mother’s fractured reality, allowing the viewer the impression of witnessing a schizophrenic episode through intrusive snapshots. Sometimes she smokes, looking melancholic; sometimes she lies in bed, smiling with Elsa. While Bittersweet remains Hura’s most personal—certainly his most vulnerable—work to date, it represents a significant shift in his engagement with reality. As he questions the boundaries between personal exposure and public consumption, Hura moves beyond mere documentation, instead drawing the viewer into his intimate, subjective experience and the complex social processes through which images are consumed and interpreted. Today, Hura's work takes on a new urgency. Meta plans to populate its platforms with AI-generated users; there has been a surge in harassment, hate speech, and misinformation since Musk’s takeover of X. (And that’s without accounting for the platform’s role in aiding Trump secure the US Presidency, or Musk’s attempts to wade into British politics.) None of this is new thematic territory for Hura, though, who has spoken about the political ramifications of digitally altered images for years. “With algorithms and AI now making most of these viral videos and images—and this is only going to get more prolific and perverse—I feel the future of photography lies in its glitches,” he observes. “As photographers, we will make mistakes, and accidents will happen, and these will help us remember that we are still human.”7 Hura’s art toys with the manipulability of images and their contexts, challenging viewers to chart the hidden codes and meanings embedded within them. In his films, we find a madness that asks us to suspend our belief while drawing us in deeper: we find a world in disarray, much like our own. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.

Jan 27, 2025 Matthew Hare, CEO of Zzoomm (left) shakes on the merger deal with James Warner, CEO of FullFibre. In today’s industry news roundup: UK fibre altnets Zzoomm and FullFibre have agreed to combine their businesses and assets; more big names are putting forward their massive AI datacentre plans; DeepSeek’s low-cost approach to GenAI causes chaos in the AI and chip world; and much more! UK fibre broadband altnet Zzoomm, which last September ​​hired advisors to help it find potential merger partners in a bid to gain scale, has struck an M&A deal with fellow altnet FullFibre. The combined company will have a network that reaches 600,000 UK properties, more than 65,000 paying customers, and will “be well positioned for further M&A,” according to this announcement from FullFibre, which has previously expanded as a result of a merger with another fibre network builder, Digital Infrastructure. Financial details of the deal were not shared. Zzoomm’s CEO, Matthew Hare, will become executive chairman of the combined company, while James Warner, currently CEO of FullFibre, will be group CEO. “The merged entity combines two complementary networks and operating models,” noted FullFibre. “This will create significant opportunities to accelerate customer growth across a larger footprint, secure funding for new builds and future mergers, and achieve greater operational and financial efficiencies through economies of scale,” it added. The deal is subject to “final documentation execution and regulatory approval” but this is expected in the next few months. Zzoomm’s Hare noted: “We have consistently stated our strategy is to grow organically and by M&A in this fragmented market. [As] an enlarged business with the operational and financial infrastructure, benefitting from the economies of scale, as well as a management team with an exceptional track record, we will have an excellent platform to combine with other altnets in the near future as well as driving organic growth faster.” FullFibre’s Warner added: “With a shared commitment to delivering transformational full fibre connectivity with exceptional customer experience, this deal strengthens our collective ability to grow even faster and seize new market opportunities. For FullFibre, this is our second merger and another milestone in our mission to create a 21st-century digital backbone for the nation. Following our recent successful integration with Digital Infrastructure and BeFibre, this next merger further accelerates our ambitions to lead the market and provide unmatched connectivity to homes, businesses, and wholesale partners alike.” In what looks like a response to the Stargate Project AI infrastructure plans announced last week by OpenAI, SoftBank and others, Meta’s chairman, CEO and majority owner Mark Zuckerberg, has taken to his company’s Threads social media platform to announce a significant increase in infrastructure investment this year and plans for a datacentre that with processing capacity of more than 2 gigawatts “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan”. In this Threads post, Zuckerberg stated that Meta will “bring online [about] 1 gigawatt of compute” and “end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60 to $65bn in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead. This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership.” Forbes noted that the capex figure is way above the $51bn expected by Wall Street analysts and a giant leap up from the projected 2024 full year capex of $38.4bn. Meanwhile, reports continue to emerge of how Stargate’s backers intend to fund the giant project. OpenAI and SoftBank are believed to be pumping an initial $19bn each into the planned deployments, leaving the stakeholders some way short of the $100bn they stated was ready to be deployed with immediate effect. In addition, Nikkei Asia reported that Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank (which is responsible for Stargate’s funding strategy), is to approach investment firms Apollo Global Management and Brookfield about funding the initiative’s AI datacentres. While that saga continues, India’s Reliance Industries is keen to play a role in the global race to build staggering volumes of datacentre capacity. According to Bloomberg, Reliance plans to build the world’s largest AI datacentre in Jamnagar with a capacity of 3 gigawatts, a move that will cost up to $30bn. According to Bloomberg, the world’s largest datacentre currently is a 600 megawatts site in Virginia, US. Reliance is one of a number of Indian tech giants (along with Tata Communications and Tech Mahindra) that have already developed relationships with AI chip giant Nvidia, which noted during its AI Summit event in Mumbai last October that Reliance is working with Nvidia to build “AI factories to automate industrial tasks and transform processes in sectors like energy and manufacturing”. But all of these plans might be subject to revision, in one way or another, as the AI world takes stock of the potential impact of DeepSeek, an open-source, generative AI (GenAI) platform from China that appears to match the capabilities of existing GenAI apps, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, while reportedly running on far more cost-effective compute infrastructure. The DeepSeek app was launched last week and is already top of the Apple App Store’s ranking of free apps, one ahead of ChatGPT. DeepSeek’s capabilities and its ability to match other apps while running on less advanced chips than its US rivals sent to stock markets into panic mode, reported Bloomberg, with Nvidia’s share price slumping by almost 13% to $124.47 in early trading on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday. As a result of that decline, Nvidia’s market value is only just above $3tn (so it’s not in any danger of collapse…). While the launch of new AI apps and models is only going to continue, and potentially cause ructions in the AI tech world, all of these developments spell good news for the telecom sector. All that data traffic needs to be shunted from A to B across data networks, and while the hyperscalers have some of their own network infrastructure, they, as well as the world’s enterprises, will need to rely on data network operators to underpin their operations, which is the exact point Verizon made when it launched its AI Connect strategy at the end of last week. Having recently reached a binding agreement to form a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) joint venture, two of Spain’s main telcos, MásOrange and Vodafone Spain (now owned by Zegona Communications), are reportedly in talks to form a mobile network joint venture that would combine their radio access network assets, reports Expansion. Any resulting company would then seek to sell a stake to an external investor, which is the same model the operators are deploying with their FTTP venture. UK broadband network operator TalkTalk is investigating a potential data breach after a hacker offered access to the details of 19 million current and former customers, according to The Register. – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: How Ciena keeps the internet online, with CEO Gary Smith

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

Title: 'AI's Sputnik moment': China-based DeepSeek's open-source models may be a real threat to the dominance of OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia

Some serious competition, at the very least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. US-based companies have been at the forefront of the AI revolution, but now it looks like a new challenger has emerged. China-based DeepSeek is just over a year old, but the startup has released an open-source AI model called R1 that seems to have the rest of the industry worried. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the co-founder of High Flyer, an AI-driven hedge-fund (via Bloomberg). Despite being a mere fledgling in the AI world compared to some of the bigger names like OpenAI and Meta, the DeepSeek V3 family of AI models appear to be much more efficient than competitors' efforts like ChatGPT. Now R1, a new reasoning model fine-tuned from V3 training, also appears to be comparable in performance and accuracy to OpenAI's efforts. The Register has performed some early testing on R1 in comparison to OpenAI's o1, a similar "Chain of Thought" (CoT) model, and found that its capabilities seem remarkably similar—with the former even beating out the OpenAI model in the MATH-500 test. All while costing much less to train, with a Chiphell forum user claiming that "DeepSeek-R1 is priced at only about 3.65% of OpenAI o1" per million outputs. That's potentially bad news for Nvidia, which has been raking in cash as a result of high sales of its AI accelerator hardware to run the latest models at scale, taking the company's valuation up to the highest by market cap in the world at time of writing. According to some analysts, Nvidia's stock price is on track to shed nearly $400 billion dollars in the wake of R1's launch, although it appears to be holding relatively steady after a slump in early Monday trading. Dutch chip-maker ASML has seen its share price fall by more than 10% since R1's launch, while Siemens Energy dropped by 21%. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. US venture capitalist and advisor to Donald Trump, Marc Andreessen, made the comparison of R1's launch to the US and USSR space race, calling it "AI's Sputnik moment." Sputnik was a satellite launched by the USSR in 1957, and is widely thought to have wrongfooted the US government on the Soviet Union's space capabilities, leading to a space race between the two nations. What is artificial general intelligence?: We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. The elephant in the room, however, is trade sanctions. The US government has banned the export of high-end AI hardware to China, which some have speculated has led to a more efficient approach resulting in DeepSeek's new models. If so, that would suggest that the sanctions haven't had the effect that the US gov may have hoped. However, being a Chinese product (and given that many of the leading AI companies are US-based), it seems possible that restrictions may follow on its use for US companies, and potentially even those using US equipment, in the same fashion as the current trade sanctions. Either way, the release of DeepSeek-R1 appears to have caused a significant rumble in the AI markets. Whatever happens next, it seems that the US may no longer hold all the keys to advanced AI—and the world awaits it's response. Andy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a thing and high resolution wasn't.

Title: DeepSeek FAQ
URL: https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:05:14Z
Full Content:
Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It’s Monday, January 27. Why haven’t you written about DeepSeek yet? I did! I wrote about R1 last Tuesday. I totally forgot about that. I take responsibility. I stand by the post, including the two biggest takeaways that I highlighted (emergent chain-of-thought via pure reinforcement learning, and the power of distillation), and I mentioned the low cost (which I expanded on in Sharp Tech) and chip ban implications, but those observations were too localized to the current state of the art in AI. What I totally failed to anticipate were the broader implications this news would have to the overall meta-discussion, particularly in terms of the U.S. and China. Is there precedent for such a miss? There is. In September 2023 Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro with a SMIC-manufactured 7nm chip. The existence of this chip wasn’t a surprise for those paying close attention: SMIC had made a 7nm chip a year earlier (the existence of which I had noted even earlier than that), and TSMC had shipped 7nm chips in volume using nothing but DUV lithography (later iterations of 7nm were the first to use EUV). Intel had also made 10nm (TSMC 7nm equivalent) chips years earlier using nothing but DUV, but couldn’t do so with profitable yields; the idea that SMIC could ship 7nm chips using their existing equipment, particularly if they didn’t care about yields, wasn’t remotely surprising — to me, anyways. What I totally failed to anticipate was the overwrought reaction in Washington D.C. The dramatic expansion in the chip ban that culminated in the Biden administration transforming chip sales to a permission-based structure was downstream from people not understanding the intricacies of chip production, and being totally blindsided by the Huawei Mate 60 Pro. I get the sense that something similar has happened over the last 72 hours: the details of what DeepSeek has accomplished — and what they have not — are less important than the reaction and what that reaction says about people’s pre-existing assumptions. So what did DeepSeek announce? The most proximate announcement to this weekend’s meltdown was R1, a reasoning model that is similar to OpenAI’s o1. However, many of the revelations that contributed to the meltdown — including DeepSeek’s training costs — actually accompanied the V3 announcement over Christmas. Moreover, many of the breakthroughs that undergirded V3 were actually revealed with the release of the V2 model last January. Is this model naming convention the greatest crime that OpenAI has committed? Second greatest; we’ll get to the greatest momentarily. Let’s work backwards: what was the V2 model, and why was it important? The DeepSeek-V2 model introduced two important breakthroughs: DeepSeekMoE and DeepSeekMLA. The “MoE” in DeepSeekMoE refers to “mixture of experts”. Some models, like GPT-3.5, activate the entire model during both training and inference; it turns out, however, that not every part of the model is necessary for the topic at hand. MoE splits the model into multiple “experts” and only activates the ones that are necessary; GPT-4 was a MoE model that was believed to have 16 experts with approximately 110 billion parameters each. DeepSeekMoE, as implemented in V2, introduced important innovations on this concept, including differentiating between more finely-grained specialized experts, and shared experts with more generalized capabilities. Critically, DeepSeekMoE also introduced new approaches to load-balancing and routing during training; traditionally MoE increased communications overhead in training in exchange for efficient inference, but DeepSeek’s approach made training more efficient as well. DeepSeekMLA was an even bigger breakthrough. One of the biggest limitations on inference is the sheer amount of memory required: you both need to load the model into memory and also load the entire context window. Context windows are particularly expensive in terms of memory, as every token requires both a key and corresponding value; DeepSeekMLA, or multi-head latent attention, makes it possible to compress the key-value store, dramatically decreasing memory usage during inference. I’m not sure I understood any of that. The key implications of these breakthroughs — and the part you need to understand — only became apparent with V3, which added a new approach to load balancing (further reducing communications overhead) and multi-token prediction in training (further densifying each training step, again reducing overhead): V3 was shockingly cheap to train. DeepSeek claimed the model training took 2,788 thousand H800 GPU hours, which, at a cost of $2/GPU hour, comes out to a mere $5.576 million. That seems impossibly low. DeepSeek is clear that these costs are only for the final training run, and exclude all other expenses; from the V3 paper: Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. So no, you can’t replicate DeepSeek the company for $5.576 million. I still don’t believe that number. Actually, the burden of proof is on the doubters, at least once you understand the V3 architecture. Remember that bit about DeepSeekMoE: V3 has 671 billion parameters, but only 37 billion parameters in the active expert are computed per token; this equates to 333.3 billion FLOPs of compute per token. Here I should mention another DeepSeek innovation: while parameters were stored with BF16 or FP32 precision, they were reduced to FP8 precision for calculations; 2048 H800 GPUs have a capacity of 3.97 exoflops, i.e. 3.97 billion billion FLOPS. The training set, meanwhile, consisted of 14.8 trillion tokens; once you do all of the math it becomes apparent that 2.8 million H800 hours is sufficient for training V3. Again, this was just the final run, not the total cost, but it’s a plausible number. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang said they have 50,000 H100s. I don’t know where Wang got his information; I’m guessing he’s referring to this November 2024 tweet from Dylan Patel, which says that DeepSeek had “over 50k Hopper GPUs”. H800s, however, are Hopper GPUs, they just have much more constrained memory bandwidth than H100s because of U.S. sanctions. Here’s the thing: a huge number of the innovations I explained above are about overcoming the lack of memory bandwidth implied in using H800s instead of H100s. Moreover, if you actually did the math on the previous question, you would realize that DeepSeek actually had an excess of computing; that’s because DeepSeek actually programmed 20 of the 132 processing units on each H800 specifically to manage cross-chip communications. This is actually impossible to do in CUDA. DeepSeek engineers had to drop down to PTX, a low-level instruction set for Nvidia GPUs that is basically like assembly language. This is an insane level of optimization that only makes sense if you are using H800s. Meanwhile, DeepSeek also makes their models available for inference: that requires a whole bunch of GPUs above-and-beyond whatever was used for training. So was this a violation of the chip ban? Nope. H100s were prohibited by the chip ban, but not H800s. Everyone assumed that training leading edge models required more interchip memory bandwidth, but that is exactly what DeepSeek optimized both their model structure and infrastructure around. Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth. So V3 is a leading edge model? It’s definitely competitive with OpenAI’s 4o and Anthropic’s Sonnet-3.5, and appears to be better than Llama’s biggest model. What does seem likely is that DeepSeek was able to distill those models to give V3 high quality tokens to train on. What is distillation? Distillation is a means of extracting understanding from another model; you can send inputs to the teacher model and record the outputs, and use that to train the student model. This is how you get models like GPT-4 Turbo from GPT-4. Distillation is easier for a company to do on its own models, because they have full access, but you can still do distillation in a somewhat more unwieldy way via API, or even, if you get creative, via chat clients. Distillation obviously violates the terms of service of various models, but the only way to stop it is to actually cut off access, via IP banning, rate limiting, etc. It’s assumed to be widespread in terms of model training, and is why there are an ever-increasing number of models converging on GPT-4o quality. This doesn’t mean that we know for a fact that DeepSeek distilled 4o or Claude, but frankly, it would be odd if they didn’t. Distillation seems terrible for leading edge models. It is! On the positive side, OpenAI and Anthropic and Google are almost certainly using distillation to optimize the models they use for inference for their consumer-facing apps; on the negative side, they are effectively bearing the entire cost of training the leading edge, while everyone else is free-riding on their investment. Indeed, this is probably the core economic factor undergirding the slow divorce of Microsoft and OpenAI. Microsoft is interested in providing inference to its customers, but much less enthused about funding $100 billion data centers to train leading edge models that are likely to be commoditized long before that $100 billion is depreciated. Is this why all of the Big Tech stock prices are down? In the long run, model commoditization and cheaper inference — which DeepSeek has also demonstrated — is great for Big Tech. A world where Microsoft gets to provide inference to its customers for a fraction of the cost means that Microsoft has to spend less on data centers and GPUs, or, just as likely, sees dramatically higher usage given that inference is so much cheaper. Another big winner is Amazon: AWS has by-and-large failed to make their own quality model, but that doesn’t matter if there are very high quality open source models that they can serve at far lower costs than expected. Apple is also a big winner. Dramatically decreased memory requirements for inference make edge inference much more viable, and Apple has the best hardware for exactly that. Apple Silicon uses unified memory, which means that the CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit) have access to a shared pool of memory; this means that Apple’s high-end hardware actually has the best consumer chip for inference (Nvidia gaming GPUs max out at 32GB of VRAM, while Apple’s chips go up to 192 GB of RAM). Meta, meanwhile, is the biggest winner of all. I already laid out last fall how every aspect of Meta’s business benefits from AI; a big barrier to realizing that vision is the cost of inference, which means that dramatically cheaper inference — and dramatically cheaper training, given the need for Meta to stay on the cutting edge — makes that vision much more achievable. Google, meanwhile, is probably in worse shape: a world of decreased hardware requirements lessens the relative advantage they have from TPUs. More importantly, a world of zero-cost inference increases the viability and likelihood of products that displace search; granted, Google gets lower costs as well, but any change from the status quo is probably a net negative. I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. Wait, you haven’t even talked about R1 yet. R1 is a reasoning model like OpenAI’s o1. It has the ability to think through a problem, producing much higher quality results, particularly in areas like coding, math, and logic (but I repeat myself). Is this more impressive than V3? Actually, the reason why I spent so much time on V3 is that that was the model that actually demonstrated a lot of the dynamics that seem to be generating so much surprise and controversy. R1 is notable, however, because o1 stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader. R1 undoes the o1 mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can’t be replicated. Second, R1 — like all of DeepSeek’s models — has open weights (the problem with saying “open source” is that we don’t have the data that went into creating it). This means that instead of paying OpenAI to get reasoning, you can run R1 on the server of your choice, or even locally, at dramatically lower cost. How did DeepSeek make R1? DeepSeek actually made two models: R1 and R1-Zero. I actually think that R1-Zero is the bigger deal; as I noted above, it was my biggest focus in last Tuesday’s Update: R1-Zero, though, is the bigger deal in my mind. From the paper: In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. Reinforcement learning is a technique where a machine learning model is given a bunch of data and a reward function. The classic example is AlphaGo, where DeepMind gave the model the rules of Go with the reward function of winning the game, and then let the model figure everything else on its own. This famously ended up working better than other more human-guided techniques. LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc. RLHF was the key innovation in transforming GPT-3 into ChatGPT, with well-formed paragraphs, answers that were concise and didn’t trail off into gibberish, etc. R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning. DeepSeek gave the model a set of math, code, and logic questions, and set two reward functions: one for the right answer, and one for the right format that utilized a thinking process. Moreover, the technique was a simple one: instead of trying to evaluate step-by-step (process supervision), or doing a search of all possible answers (a la AlphaGo), DeepSeek encouraged the model to try several different answers at a time and then graded them according to the two reward functions. What emerged is a model that developed reasoning and chains-of-thought on its own, including what DeepSeek called “Aha Moments”: A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. This moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The “aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. This is one of the most powerful affirmations yet of The Bitter Lesson: you don’t need to teach the AI how to reason, you can just give it enough compute and data and it will teach itself! Well, almost: R1-Zero reasons, but in a way that humans have trouble understanding. Back to the introduction: However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. This sounds a lot like what OpenAI did for o1: DeepSeek started the model out with a bunch of examples of chain-of-thought thinking so it could learn the proper format for human consumption, and then did the reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning, along with a number of editing and refinement steps; the output is a model that appears to be very competitive with o1. Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime. So are we close to AGI? It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. But isn’t R1 now in the lead? I don’t think so; this has been overstated. R1 is competitive with o1, although there do seem to be some holes in its capability that point towards some amount of distillation from o1-Pro. OpenAI, meanwhile, has demonstrated o3, a far more powerful reasoning model. DeepSeek is absolutely the leader in efficiency, but that is different than being the leader overall. So why is everyone freaking out? I think there are multiple factors. First, there is the shock that China has caught up to the leading U.S. labs, despite the widespread assumption that China isn’t as good at software as the U.S.. This is probably the biggest thing I missed in my surprise over the reaction. The reality is that China has an extremely proficient software industry generally, and a very good track record in AI model building specifically. Second is the low training cost for V3, and DeepSeek’s low inference costs. This part was a big surprise for me as well, to be sure, but the numbers are plausible. This, by extension, probably has everyone nervous about Nvidia, which obviously has a big impact on the market. Third is the fact that DeepSeek pulled this off despite the chip ban. Again, though, while there are big loopholes in the chip ban, it seems likely to me that DeepSeek accomplished this with legal chips. I own Nvidia! Am I screwed? There are real challenges this news presents to the Nvidia story. Nvidia has two big moats: These two moats work together. I noted above that if DeepSeek had access to H100s they probably would have used a larger cluster to train their model, simply because that would have been the easier option; the fact they didn’t, and were bandwidth constrained, drove a lot of their decisions in terms of both model architecture and their training infrastructure. Just look at the U.S. labs: they haven’t spent much time on optimization because Nvidia has been aggressively shipping ever more capable systems that accommodate their needs. The route of least resistance has simply been to pay Nvidia. DeepSeek, however, just demonstrated that another route is available: heavy optimization can produce remarkable results on weaker hardware and with lower memory bandwidth; simply paying Nvidia more isn’t the only way to make better models. That noted, there are three factors still in Nvidia’s favor. First, how capable might DeepSeek’s approach be if applied to H100s, or upcoming GB100s? Just because they found a more efficient way to use compute doesn’t mean that more compute wouldn’t be useful. Second, lower inference costs should, in the long run, drive greater usage. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a late night tweet almost assuredly directed at the market, said exactly that: Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of. https://t.co/omEcOPhdIz Third, reasoning models like R1 and o1 derive their superior performance from using more compute. To the extent that increasing the power and capabilities of AI depend on more compute is the extent that Nvidia stands to benefit! Still, it’s not all rosy. At a minimum DeepSeek’s efficiency and broad availability cast significant doubt on the most optimistic Nvidia growth story, at least in the near term. The payoffs from both model and infrastructure optimization also suggest there are significant gains to be had from exploring alternative approaches to inference in particular. For example, it might be much more plausible to run inference on a standalone AMD GPU, completely sidestepping AMD’s inferior chip-to-chip communications capability. Reasoning models also increase the payoff for inference-only chips that are even more specialized than Nvidia’s GPUs. In short, Nvidia isn’t going anywhere; the Nvidia stock, however, is suddenly facing a lot more uncertainty that hasn’t been priced in. And that, by extension, is going to drag everyone down. So what about the chip ban? The easiest argument to make is that the importance of the chip ban has only been accentuated given the U.S.’s rapidly evaporating lead in software. Software and knowhow can’t be embargoed — we’ve had these debates and realizations before — but chips are physical objects and the U.S. is justified in keeping them away from China. At the same time, there should be some humility about the fact that earlier iterations of the chip ban seem to have directly led to DeepSeek’s innovations. Those innovations, moreover, would extend to not just smuggled Nvidia chips or nerfed ones like the H800, but to Huawei’s Ascend chips as well. Indeed, you can very much make the case that the primary outcome of the chip ban is today’s crash in Nvidia’s stock price. What concerns me is the mindset undergirding something like the chip ban: instead of competing through innovation in the future the U.S. is competing through the denial of innovation in the past. Yes, this may help in the short term — again, DeepSeek would be even more effective with more computing — but in the long run it simply sews the seeds for competition in an industry — chips and semiconductor equipment — over which the U.S. has a dominant position. Like AI models? AI models are a great example. I mentioned above I would get to OpenAI’s greatest crime, which I consider to be the 2023 Biden Executive Order on AI. I wrote in Attenuating Innovation: The point is this: if you accept the premise that regulation locks in incumbents, then it sure is notable that the early AI winners seem the most invested in generating alarm in Washington, D.C. about AI. This despite the fact that their concern is apparently not sufficiently high to, you know, stop their work. No, they are the responsible ones, the ones who care enough to call for regulation; all the better if concerns about imagined harms kneecap inevitable competitors. That paragraph was about OpenAI specifically, and the broader San Francisco AI community generally. For years now we have been subject to hand-wringing about the dangers of AI by the exact same people committed to building it — and controlling it. These alleged dangers were the impetus for OpenAI becoming closed back in 2019 with the release of GPT-2: Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code⁠(opens in a new window). We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights…We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems. We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly. The arrogance in this statement is only surpassed by the futility: here we are six years later, and the entire world has access to the weights of a dramatically superior model. OpenAI’s gambit for control — enforced by the U.S. government — has utterly failed. In the meantime, how much innovation has been foregone by virtue of leading edge models not having open weights? More generally, how much time and energy has been spent lobbying for a government-enforced moat that DeepSeek just obliterated, that would have been better devoted to actual innovation? So you’re not worried about AI doom scenarios? I definitely understand the concern, and just noted above that we are reaching the stage where AIs are training AIs and learning reasoning on their own. I recognize, though, that there is no stopping this train. More than that, this is exactly why openness is so important: we need more AIs in the world, not an unaccountable board ruling all of us. Wait, why is China open-sourcing their model? Well DeepSeek is, to be clear; CEO Liang Wenfeng said in a must-read interview that open source is key to attracting talent: In the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI’s closed source approach can’t prevent others from catching up. So we anchor our value in our team — our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That’s our moat. Open source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this. The interviewer asked if this would change: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This actually makes sense beyond idealism. If models are commodities — and they are certainly looking that way — then long-term differentiation comes from having a superior cost structure; that is exactly what DeepSeek has delivered, which itself is resonant of how China has come to dominate other industries. This is also contrary to how most U.S. companies think about differentiation, which is through having differentiated products that can sustain larger margins. So is OpenAI screwed? Not necessarily. ChatGPT made OpenAI the accidental consumer tech company, which is to say a product company; there is a route to building a sustainable consumer business on commoditizable models through some combination of subscriptions and advertisements. And, of course, there is the bet on winning the race to AI take-off. Anthropic, on the other hand, is probably the biggest loser of the weekend. DeepSeek made it to number one in the App Store, simply highlighting how Claude, in contrast, hasn’t gotten any traction outside of San Francisco. The API business is doing better, but API businesses in general are the most susceptible to the commoditization trends that seem inevitable (and do note that OpenAI and Anthropic’s inference costs look a lot higher than DeepSeek because they were capturing a lot of margin; that’s going away). So this is all pretty depressing, then? Actually, no. I think that DeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services. Jevons Paradox will rule the day in the long run, and everyone who uses AI will be the biggest winners. Another set of winners are the big consumer tech companies. A world of free AI is a world where product and distribution matters most, and those companies already won that game; The End of the Beginning was right. China is also a big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time. Not only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek’s relative success to America’s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realize they can compete. That leaves America, and a choice we have to make. We could, for very logical reasons, double down on defensive measures, like massively expanding the chip ban and imposing a permission-based regulatory regime on chips and semiconductor equipment that mirrors the E.U.’s approach to tech; alternatively, we could realize that we have real competition, and actually give ourself permission to compete. Stop wringing our hands, stop campaigning for regulations — indeed, go the other way, and cut out all of the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning. If we choose to compete we can still win, and, if we do, we will have a Chinese company to thank. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.

Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 early Monday as a global technology stock sell-off rattled markets to start the week. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 3.51% as of Monday morning, bringing its price to $101,295 apiece. That was a recovery from a low of about $97,900 earlier in the day. Bitcoin has been boosted in recent months by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which first sent the popular coin above $100,000 last month in the aftermath of his election victory. Last week, Trump signed an executive order that set the stage for industry-friendly regulations and a national cryptocurrency stockpile — key campaign promises he made to the industry. But Bitcoin isn’t immune from other market turmoil. Contracts for all three major U.S. indices fell tumbled Monday morning as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Futures of the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 800 points, or roughly 4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%), were also down more than 300 points as of Monday morning. S&P 500 futures tumbled 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” Investors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Fed policymakers are expected to hold rates steady following this week’s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The Fed reduced rates by a full percentage point in the span of three months last year, bringing the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a more cautious approach to interest rates this year, as concerns about balancing rising inflation with the strong labor market persist. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a news conference following the committee’s December meeting. “And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).
