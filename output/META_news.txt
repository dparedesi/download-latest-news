Title: Five Ways To Avoid The Five Hottest Stocks

ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Indexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks. The affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically. Herewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond. Index investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That’s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund’s position in Nvidia. But history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today’s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26. Here are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You’re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing. Replace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX. Without a Fidelity account you’re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT. The total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000. You can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder. In lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad. VT’s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you’ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings. Instead of accepting Vanguard’s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio. There are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia. There are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender. Over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, “cheap” is synonymous with “high-yielding.” In August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That’s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond. There are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long. If you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470. These numbers are bit confusing, so here’s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That’s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity. Long Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond’s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today’s tippy toppy S&P 500.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change The Week That Was: 2025-08-23 (August 23, 2025)Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org)The Science and Environmental Policy Project Quote of the Week: “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion… Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them…he must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form.” — John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859) [H/t John Robson] Number of the Week: About 7,000 ppmv THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a second discussion of key issues in the report by the Climate Working Group to the Secretary of Energy. Then, it presents a request for information from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. TWTW concludes with a discussion of the reasons why grid level storage batteries are impractical for a modern grid. ********************* Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 2): Last week, TWTW began discussing the main body of a report to the Secretary of Energy from five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D. Judith Curry, Ph.D. Steven Koonin, Ph.D. Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., and Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.” The report is well written in clear English with no specialized jargon or mathematics. It is not a report typical of Washington bureaucracies. This week, TWTW will cover key sections of Part II: Climate Response to CO2 Emissions including Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations. Part II Climate Response to CO2 Emissions begins with Chapter 4, Climate Sensitivity to CO2 Forcing. The Chapter Summary States: “There is growing recognition that climate models are not fit for the purpose of determining the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of the climate to increasing CO2. The IPCC has turned to data driven approaches including historical data and paleoclimate reconstructions, but their reliability is diminished by data inadequacies. Data-driven ECS estimates tend to be lower than climate model-generated values. The IPCC AR6 upper bound for the likely range of ECS is 4.0°C, lower than the AR5 value of 4.5°C. This lowering of the upper bound seems well justified by paleoclimatic data. The AR6 lower bound for the likely range of ECS is 2.5°C, substantially higher than the AR5 value of 1.5°C. This raising of the lower bound is less justified; evidence since AR6 finds the lower bound of the likely range to be around 1.8°C.” TWTW Comment: Organizations have committed considerable resources in the pursuit of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) which TWTW considers to be a folly. As discussed in the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, Earth has multiple climates, and they are constantly changing. It has never had an equilibrium climate. Calculating an ECS is like calculating an ideal global temperature. If one is above it or below it, so what? The issue is temperature extremes. Further, the typical calculations rely on positive climate feedbacks to a slight warming. Positive feedbacks contradict La Chatelier’s Principle that if a system in equilibrium is subject to change it tends to counteract the change in order to establish a new equilibrium. Even though in the era of Icehouse Earth there are great oscillations from the relationship between Earth and the Sun, Earth’s climate appears to fit La Chatelier’s Principle, otherwise minor disturbances would become major one. This appears to be what climate modelers appear to be stressing, minor disturbances will become a major one. Given the belief in models by many organizations, it is important that the report address these unfortunate beliefs. In its introduction to chapter 4 states: “The magnitude of the climate’s response to increasing concentrations of CO2 is central to the scientific debate on anthropogenic climate change, and so also to the public debate on ‘climate action.’ The simplest measure of that response is the rise in the global average surface temperature, quantified by the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS). ECS is defined as the amount of warming expected in response to a doubling of CO2 from its pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppm, after all climate components have had time to adjust. Some components, like temperatures in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), adjust rapidly, while others such as the deep ocean and cryosphere might take as long as centuries. A related measure, the Transient Climate Response (TCR), better describes the shorter time scales; it is defined as the amount of warming when the CO2 concentration is doubled by rising one percent annually for 70 years. The 1979 Charney Report for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council 1979) proposed that the most likely ECS was 3.0 ± 1.5°C. The IPCC repeatedly reaffirmed that range with only minor variations until its most recent AR6. AR5 termed 1.5–4.5°C as the likely range (66 percent probability) and stated that ECS is extremely unlikely (95 percent probability) to be below 1.0°C and very unlikely (90 percent probability) to exceed 6.5°C. The uncertainty in ECS has remained stubbornly wide, despite many individual studies that claimed to narrow it (Hausfather 2023). Most recently, AR6 narrowed the likely range to 2.5–4.0°C and deemed the very likely range to be 2.0–5.0°C. This narrowing on the low end is disputed, as will be discussed below. Uncertainties in ECS are highly consequential for policy making. As will be discussed in Chapter 11, economic models use ECS values to project the costs of CO2 emissions. The traditional value (3.0 °C) has typically yielded modest global social costs of CO2 emissions, sufficient to justify some policy actions, but mostly deferred to later in this century. If ECS is very high (above 4.5°C) immediate aggressive emission controls become more imperative, whereas no CO2 emission controls are economically justifiable for ECS below 2.0°C (Dayaratna et al. 2017, 2020). Obtaining a precise estimate is impossible, so policy making needs to account for the uncertainty. By itself, the equilibrium warming effect of a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is slightly more than 1°C (Soden and Held 2006). Larger values of ECS arise from positive feedbacks that amplifies the CO2 warming. Water vapor feedback is positive: a warmer atmosphere might have more water vapor, which itself is a powerful greenhouse gas. Warmer temperatures also result in less snow and sea ice cover, allowing the Earth to absorb more of the sun’s radiation. Some simple estimates of these feedbacks increase the ECS to around 2°C (Sherwood et al., 2020). Larger values of ECS are associated with positive cloud feedbacks. Climate scientists use multiple lines of evidence to determine the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity: • Climate model simulations • Historical observations • Paleoclimatic reconstructions • Process understanding of feedbacks” TWTW Comment: Here we see the importance of the 1979 Charney Report which TWTW has mentioned frequently. The conclusions of the report were heavily influenced by numerical weather modelers who assumed that the influence of CO2 on temperatures will be doubled by in increase in water vapor. The increase in water vapor needed to double the CO2’s influence on temperature has not been observed. Further, the Charney Report came as Edward Lorenz and others were developing Chaos Theory where there are underlying patterns to apparently chaotic complex systems. This issue is understanding these other chaotic complex systems which those who focus on CO2 apparently ignore. In modern numerical weather forecasting, forecasts are updated frequently, say 4 times every 24 hours. Yet forecasts are not good for more than 10 to 14 days. In chaos theory, if you know data somewhat well, you can predict the immediate future, but predicting further into the future requires more and more precise knowledge of present data. Forecasts break down because the patterns of the underlying systems are not understood. Yet in modern numerical climate forecasting (global climate models) which is built on numerical weather forecasting techniques we routinely see forecasts of 50, 75, or even 200 hundred years. The need for updating is ignored. Further, climate modelers ignore the need to understand the underlying patterns of the chaotic climate system. The next section 4.2 Model-based estimates of climate sensitivity states: “The ECS ranges given in IPCC AR4 and AR5 were obtained primarily by examining the behavior of large-scale climate models, also called General Circulation Models (GCMs). However, the IPCC changed course in its AR6 when it turned to a more direct data-driven methodology. Here we discuss some of the pitfalls of using GCMs to try to determine the Earth’s climate sensitivity. ECS can be determined from climate model simulations by doubling the concentration of CO2 and allowing several centuries for the warming to equilibrate. To avoid the need for such long simulations, “effective climate sensitivity” is commonly evaluated from a 150-year simulation in response to a sudden quadrupling of CO2. In principle, ECS is an emergent property of GCMs—that is, it is not directly parameterized or tuned but rather emerges in the results of the simulation. Otherwise, plausible GCMs and parameter selections have been discarded because of perceived conflict with an expected warming rate, or aversion to a model’s climate sensitivity being outside an accepted range (Mauritsen et al. 2012). This practice was commonplace for the models used in AR4; modelers have moved away from this practice with time. However, even in a CMIP6 model, Mauritsen and Roeckner (2020) state the following regarding their Max Planck Institute (MPI) climate model (emphasis added): ‘We have documented how we tuned the MPI-ESM1.2 global climate model to match the instrumental record of warming; an endeavor which has clearly been successful. Due to the historical order of events, the choice was to do this practically by targeting an ECS of about 3 K using cloud feedbacks, as opposed to tuning the aerosol forcing.’ In other words, the MPI modelers chose an ECS value of 3°C and then tuned the cloud parameterizations to match their intended result. As noted, direct warming from CO2 doubling is only about 1°C (Soden and Held 2006); further warming arises from climate feedbacks that are not explicitly resolved by the GCM but rely on parameterizations of physical processes. Higher values of ECS arise primarily from positive cloud feedbacks, whereas the magnitude and even the sign of the feedbacks are very uncertain. Elements of cloud feedback include changes in the latitudinal distribution of clouds, changes in the distribution of cloud height (changes in low versus high clouds), changes to the phase of clouds (ice versus liquid), changes in cloud particle size (associated with changes in concentration and/or composition of aerosol particles), changes in the precipitation efficiency of clouds, and even changes in how clouds are distributed over the daily solar cycle (Curry and Webster, 1999). It is difficult for GCMs to simulate any of these processes correctly owing to their small scale, let alone predict how they will change in the future. Further, cloud processes modulate the magnitudes of the water vapor, lapse rate, and the surface albedo feedbacks.” Figure 4.1 is a graph showing the wide range of Equilibrium Climate Sensitives for 37 models from the CMIP6 ensemble is given. The lowest ECS is 1.83C, the highest is 5.67C. The section concludes with: “The spread of ECS values from the CMIP5 ensemble of climate models used in AR5 was 2.0–4.7°C; that range increased for the CMIP6 models used in AR6 to between 1.8 and 5.7°C (Chen et al., 2021, Scaffeta 2021, see Figure 4.1). Far from resolving the model-based climate sensitivity the range appears to be growing. The main cause of the overall upward shift in ECS in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 is a larger positive cloud feedback, driven by changes to the cloud parameterizations in many CMIP6 models (Zelinka et al., 2020) Because of concerns about model tuning and the high sensitivity to cloud parameterizations, AR6 (2021) did not rely on climate model simulations in their assessment of climate sensitivity, relying instead on data-driven methods.” [Boldface added] TWTW Comment: So currently, the IPCC has abandoned global climate modeling and is emphasizing data. Section 4.3 “Data-driven estimates of climate sensitivity” and Section 4.4 of the report state: “Climate sensitivity can also be estimated from instrumental records of surface temperatures and ocean heat content, combined with estimates of how climate forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases, solar, volcanoes, aerosols) have changed in the past (Otto et al., 2013). Using this information, a simple empirical Energy Balance Model can be employed. It requires estimating a feedback parameter whose uncertainties are highly amplified in the resulting ECS (Roe and Baker, 2007). The accuracy of the data-driven methods depends on the quality of the input data. Assumptions are needed about ocean heat storage, and good data has only been available for recent decades. The greatest source of uncertainty is the amount and composition of aerosol particles and their interactions with cloud radiative properties (the so-called aerosol indirect effect; see Figures 3.1.1, 3.1.2). Climate models exhibit warming in response to GHGs but cooling in response to aerosols (Schwartz et al., 2007). Observed 20th century warming can be shown to be consistent either with low ECS and low aerosol cooling, or high ECS and high aerosol cooling. Since fossil fuel use adds both GHGs and aerosols to the atmosphere, both effects need to be estimated to isolate the warming effect of CO2. Paleoclimate proxies are also used to evaluate the sensitivity of past climates by comparing paleoclimate changes in the Earth’s temperatures to estimates of changes in forcings. The two most informative periods are the last glacial maximum (around 20,000 years ago), which was about 3–7°C colder than today, and a mid-Pliocene period (roughly three million years ago), which was 1–3°C warmer than today. The limits on cooling during the last glacial maximum give the best single evidence that high values of climate sensitivity are unlikely. However, paleoclimate estimates are associated with very large uncertainties in the estimated temperatures and forcings. Further, estimates of climate sensitivity based on past climate states might not be applicable to the current state of the climate system. A recurring theme in the climate literature is that ECS estimates based on historical data are smaller than ECS estimates inferred from climate models (Sherwood and Forest 2024). About 15 estimates based on historical data appeared in the peer-reviewed literature between 2012 and 2024 yielding ECS best estimates between 1.0°C and 2.5°C, although critics have questioned some of the methods and the data quality. For AR6, the IPCC placed primary weight on the results of Sherwood et al. (2020) that combined historical data and paleoclimate proxies with the process-based approach and yielded a best estimate of 3.1°C with a likely range of 2.6-3.9°C. Lewis (2022) raised a number of concerns about this result, including methodological errors, outdated input values, and use of subjective Bayesian priors in the analysis. Lewis’ analysis found that climate sensitivity is estimated to be much lower and better constrained than in the Sherwood et al. analysis – median 2.2°C (1.8–2.7°C in the 17–83 percent likely range, and 1.6–3.2°C in the 5–95 percent very likely range). The IPCC AR6 estimated only a 5 percent probability that ECS was below 2.3°C, whereas Lewis estimated it to be over 50 percent. The most recent publications on the debate between Sherwood et al. and Lewis further defend their respective positions: Sherwood and Foster (2024) and Lewis (2025). An argument emphasized in AR6 is that data-driven ECS estimates might understate the future warming response to GHGs because of a so-called ‘pattern effect’ (Forster et al., 2021). The tropical Pacific is believed to strongly influence the overall efficiency with which the Earth radiates heat to space, but some regions remove heat more efficiently than others. If the west-to-east temperature gradient in the tropical Pacific is weakened in a warming climate, warming would concentrate where heat is less efficiently removed, raising ECS. Most climate models simulate that rising GHGs will weaken the west-east temperature gradient, which led the IPCC in AR6 to conclude that data-driven ECS estimates understated the future ECS value. However, Seager et al. (2019) pointed out that, contrary to models, the west-east temperature gradient has been strengthening over time. They further argued that the mechanism predicting otherwise in climate models was based on a faulty characterization of oceanic dynamics and there is no reason to expect the gradient to weaken. A similar argument was recently made by Lee et al. (2024), who concluded that ‘the trajectory of the observed trend reflects the response to increasing GHG loading in the atmosphere’; in other words, GHG warming should lead to a future strengthening rather than a weakening of the temperature gradient. Increased efficiency of atmospheric cooling implies, if anything, that the future ECS in a warming climate might be lower than current estimates. 4.4 Transient Climate Response The Transient Climate Response (TCR) provides a more useful observational constraint on climate sensitivity. TCR is the global temperature increase that results when CO2 is increased at an annual rate of 1 percent over a period of 70 years (i.e., doubled gradually). Relative to the ECS, observationally determined values of TCR avoid the problems of uncertainties in ocean heat uptake and the fuzzy boundary in defining equilibrium arising from a range of timescales for the longer-term feedback processes (e.g., ice sheets). TCR is better constrained by historical warming, than ECS. AR6 judged the very likely range of TCR to be 1.2–2.4°C. In contrast to ECS, the upper bound of TCR is more tightly constrained. For comparison, the TCR values determined by Lewis (2023) are 1.25 to 2.0°C, showing much better agreement with AR6 values than was seen in a comparison of the ECS values.” [Boldface added] TWTW Comment: It will be interesting to see if the IPCC continues with its data-driven approach or it will return to a modeling approach? Also, it will be interesting to see what IPCC collaborators will do. Another issue is will the IPCC use carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas concentrations as measured at Mauna Loa Observatory and elsewhere or will it speculate on these concentrations? The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide (from artificial fertilizers) are claimed to cause significant warming using laboratory experiments based on dry air. Yet water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, and it significantly diminishes the influence of both methane and nitrous oxide. The Transient Climate Response controversy presents its own set of issues. CO2 increasing at an annual rate of 1% is modest but may not be sustainable. The work of van Wijngaarden and Happer shows a logarithmic relationship. If the CO2 concentration rises exponentially with time and the warming effect is logarithmic with CO2 concentration (as shown by Happer and van Wijngaarden) the rise in temperature may or may not be linear with time. Next week, TWTW will continue to discuss “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate” emphasizing Chapter 5: Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations.” For links to the report and comments see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, for links to the reports by van Wijngaarden and Happer see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer, and for climate zones see https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/climate-zones. ********************* Request for Information: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine are soliciting information on Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases and US Climate. The deadline is August 27, at 11:59 PM ET. The announcement states: “The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine invites input to inform the work of the Committee on Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases and US Climate: Evidence and Impacts. Committee’s charge: This fast-track study will review evidence for whether anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are reasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare in the United States. The study will focus on updates since the Environmental Protection Agency finalized the Endangerment Finding in 2009, examine how current understanding compares to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, and provide explanation for any changes. The study will develop conclusions that describe supporting evidence, the level of confidence, and areas of disagreement or unknowns. We encourage you to submit peer-reviewed articles, white papers, technical reports, or other comments relevant to the committee’s charge. If you are uploading attachments, please include a brief comment on their significance for committee consideration in the box provided on the next page. Submissions to this Request for Information will be considered by the committee in preparing its report, however the committee will not provide responses to individual comments. All submissions will be accessible as part of the public record for this project.” SEPP plans to submit short, terse, easy to read comments requesting that the National Academies clarify major issues relating to the incompatibility of considering CO2 a pollutant that endangers human life and welfare and considerable inconsistent physical evidence. For example, cyanobacteria evolved over 2 billion years ago with a process of using energy from the sun to break down water and carbon dioxide and recombine the atoms into carbohydrates and oxygen, photosynthesis. Subsequently, all plant and animal life evolved depending directly or indirectly on carbohydrates and oxygen (animal life) from photosynthesis for which carbon dioxide is essential. Other issues include subjects such as geology and the fact that we are currently in a brief warm Epoch during Quaternary Period also called Icehouse Earth that features intense cold periods known as Ice Ages. For this request and others and timelines for comments on the report to the Secretary of Energy see links under Seeking a Common Ground. ********************* Battery Storage Delusion: German energy economist Lars Schernikau discusses that the Levelized Cost of Electricity may be a reasonable index when comparing equally reliable sources; but, since wind and solar are not reliable day to day, these should not be compared with reliable thermal sources such as coal, gas, and nuclear using Levelized Cost of Electricity. His essay on “Pros and Cons of Utility-Scale Battery Storage” should give pause to all but the most dedicated promoters of wind and solar. The essay discusses: Utility-scale batteries – state of affairs; Lifetime, efficiency, and battery chemistry/technology; Battery costs; Raw materials and embedded energy; Energy density; and Environmental and security risks. The Summary states: “In May 2025 alone, China deployed about 11 GWh utility-scale batteries [16] plus over 55 GWh of EV batteries. For the production of just these grid-scale batteries (without for EVs), China needed to “invest” about 8 million tons of raw materials (ores) and about 5 TWh of energy. Let me tell you a secret… those 5 TWh did NOT come from wind or solar but probably mostly from coal and some hydro power. In comparison to China, Germany’s entire installed battery storage capacity reached 20 GWh around mid-June 2025, of which less than 4 GWh were utility-scale, the rest is largely residential. At 60 GW, the 4 GWh last a whole 4 minutes. Utility-scale battery systems serve the grid in many ways, but what is not often discussed are the realities or externalities surrounding them. Therefore, let’s condense and list those realities in 10 points: Point 1: Most utility-scale batteries are ONLY required because of the ever-increasing installed capacity of intermittent, weather dependent wind and solar power, which are largely useless without extensive and complex network integration, backup, and storage systems. Point 2: Utility-scale batteries are ONLY short duration energy storage systems, they provide backup storage for a few hours at best, not for days or weeks. Thus, “solar + batteries” does NOT provide dispatchable 24/7/365 power. Point 3: Utility-scale batteries deteriorate at a rate of 3-7 % p.a. and batteries should neither be fully discharged nor charged to 100%, as this degrades their lifespan. In practice, the recommended range is 20% to 80%, meaning only around 60% of the nameplate capacity is actually usable on a daily basis. Point 4: Utility-scale batteries are expected to last on average 10-13 years. Real life round-trip efficiency (RTE) of utility-scale batteries is around 70-80% realistically. Point 5: In real life a 4-hour Lithium-Ion LFP utility-scale battery system all-in costs, not necessarily price quoted, in 2024 to 2025 range from ~150-250 USD/kWh. Point 6: Raw material or commodity prices, excluding gold, are at historically low levels in comparison to equities… something will have to give, my take is that commodity prices will rise impacting long-term battery costs. Point 7: 1 GWh of utility scale lithium-ion batteries require ~0,7 million tons of raw materials (ores) to be mined, upgraded, transported, processed, and manufactured into utility scale batteries. Details in Appendix. China controls ~90% of battery cell component manufacturing (anodes, cathodes), ~80+% of battery cell manufacturing, and majority of raw material processing for batteries. — Point 8: 1 GWh of utility scale lithium-ion batteries require ~450 GWh of energy (Table 3) before the battery can be charged for the first time. A standard Gigafactory, with an annual battery production capacity of about 50 GWh, would require over ~20 TWh of energy annually, including the embedded energy of the metals and materials consumed p.a. This compares to the city of Berlin in Germany consuming 12 TWh electricity annually. — Point 9: 100 Wh/kg energy density for utility-scale batteries at system level (not cell-level) is very aggressive and generous. Today’s reality lies more around 50 Wh/kg, which is confirmed by various data points, and would then double the tonnage and energy estimates mentioned. The 1-ton battery, when charged, contains the same amount of energy as 40kg of coal, already accounting for 40% power plant efficiency. — Point 10: A 1 GWh utility-scale lithium-ion battery system is equivalent to nearly 900 tons of TNT, with potential for large explosions, fires, and clouds of toxic gas. Recycling low value LFP batteries without cobalt and nickel, is uneconomical, and we can expect illegal “exports” and dumping.” See Links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage ********************* Number of the Week: About 7,000 ppmv: Today, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere varies significantly by season but in July 2025 at Mauna Loa it was measured at 428 parts per million by volume (ppmv). Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA from 2009 to 2013. Lubchenco repeatedly railed about the dangers of ocean acidification from increasing carbon dioxide. A number of papers appeared, giving support for her ideas by claiming that shells on mollusks and other creatures are becoming thinner. Those specializing in paleogeology cannot give precise numbers for past concentrations of CO2 but can approximate it by using proxies such as plant stomata, microscopic pores on leaves, stems and other surfaces that facilitate gas exchange. Stomata open and close with changing humidity and CO2 levels. The period beginning 540 million years ago is known as the Cambrian explosion. Marine life greatly diversified and shell-bearing creatures such as mollusks and crustations appeared. Yet estimates of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Cambrian era vary from about 4000 to 9000 ppmv, about 10 to 20 times that of today. It appears the mollusks and crustaceans will be quite safe with CO2 concentrations foreseeable today.

On the contrary, it’s between one side so arrogantly certain of their position that they brush critics aside with a tarry brush and one side that, in the humble spirit of true science, realizes there is much we do not know and is keen to talk about what we think we know, how we think we know it, and the limits of our knowledge. Happer & Wrightstone: Get Real and Stop Blaming CO2 By Ron Clutz, His Blog, Aug 17, 2025 The above interview was conducted by NTD news with CO2 Coalition founder William Happer (WH) and Executive Director Gregory Wrightstone (GW). For those preferring to read, below is a transcript from the closed captions in italics with my bolds and added images. We are in a warming trend. Yes, we are. It’s been warming for more than 300 years. But you know what that does? That means since 1900, our growing seasons in the continental United States have increased by more than two weeks. That’s a really good thing for agriculture. Your farmers will tell you they love that. So at the CO2 Coalition, our unofficial motto is: We love CO2 and so should you. INTERVIEW. Dr. Judith Curry on Global Warming: Where Is the Danger? Renowned climatologist Dr. Judith Curry says it is very tough to make the case that warming is becoming dangerous. By Hannes Sarv, Freedom Research, Freedom Research, Aug 20, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] “People used to call the warm periods the optimums, the climate optimums, because ecosystems and people thrived in these warmer climate optimums,” says Dr. Judith Curry, professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “We talk about two degrees of warming, things like that, but the part that they don’t tell you is that the baseline is the period between 1850 and 1900. [SEPP Comment: Long interview] About That Annoying DOE Climate Review Transcript of Interview of Steven Koonin by Andrew Bolt, via Ron Clutz, His Blog, Aug 18, 2025 Koonin: Well, you know, people have said 95% of our report agrees with or is taken right out of the IPCC. It’s just that there are aspects of what the consensus says that do not find their way to the public. For example: These are very important central points that are in the report but do not make their way into the public discussion. Finally, an Unbiased and Objective Climate Science Report By Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, Ph.D., U.S. Navy (Ret.), Real Clear Science, Aug 16, 2025 To better gauge the overall opinion of the report, two journalists from the Associated Press asked members of the climate science committee if they believed that it accurately portrayed the current “mainstream view of climate science.” Another Study Affirms Anthropogenic CO2 Does Not Drive Climate Change By Kenneth Richard, No Tricks Zone, Aug 22, 2025 Link to paper: A Critical Reassessment of the Anthropogenic CO₂-Global Warming Hypothesis: Empirical Evidence Contradicts IPCC Models and Solar Forcing Assumptions By Grok 3 beta, Jonathan Cohler, David Legates, Franklin Soon, Willie Soon, Science of Climate Change, 2025 Click to access SCC-Grok-3-Review-V6.pdf [SEPP Comment: The Grok 3 paper was covered in a previous TWTW.] How CO2 both Warms and Cools our Atmosphere By Jim Steele, WUWT, Aug 21, 2025 Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science Evaluating IPCC Projections of Global Sea-Level Change From the Pre-Satellite Era By Torbjörn E. Törnqvist, et al., Earth’s Future, Aug 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From abstract: With an acceleration of global sea-level rise during the satellite altimetry era (since 1993) firmly established, it is now appropriate to examine sea-level projections made around the onset of this time period. Here we show that the mid-range projection from the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC (1995/1996) was strikingly close to what transpired over the next 30 years, with the magnitude of sea-level rise underestimated by only ∼1 cm.. [SEPP Comment: Testing projections against projections. The article fails to test projections against physical evidence from geologically stable tidal gauges.] Climate forcing due to future ozone changes: an intercomparison of metrics and methods By William J. Collins, et al., Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, Aug 21, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 (SSP3-7.0) we find robust increases in ozone due to future increases in ozone precursors and decreases in ODSs, leading to a radiative forcing increase from 2015 to 2050 of 0.268 ± 0.084 W m−2 ERF, 0.244 ± 0.057 W m−2 SARF and 0.288 ± 0.101 W m−2 IRF. This increase makes ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 in this scenario, approximately half of which is due to stratospheric ozone recovery and half due to tropospheric ozone precursors. [SEPP Comment: Building on models that fail basic testing.] Questioning the Orthodoxy Good questions can stop bad projects By David Wojick, CFACT, Aug 19, 2025 If you want to speak out against a bad project at a public meeting, consider asking a hard question instead of stating an objection. Objections call for no immediate action except perhaps a cursory “thank you, we will think about that.” Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Aug 20, 2025 Please remember the “Gell-Mann Amnesia” effect referenced by Steven Koonin in Unsettled: when you read a news story about a subject you know well and it’s a mess, don’t forget it as soon as you turn to a story on which you’re not an expert. It’s almost certainly a mess too. And if you don’t know that… By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Aug 20, 2025 There’s a remarkable tendency nowadays for climate alarmists, a category that includes much of the press, to regard climate change as so conclusively settled that checking actual facts is for losers.

Pedatella, et al., Geophysical Research Letters, June 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The Community Earth System Model (CESM) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X) is used to investigate how the ionosphere-thermosphere response to a May 2024-like geomagnetic storm changes with increasing greenhouse gases. Coupled CESM(WACCM-X) simulations are first performed following the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5 from 2000 to 2090. The May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm is then simulated in 2016, 2040, 2061, and 2084, corresponding to surface CO2 levels of 403, 500, 652, and 918 ppmv, respectively. [SEPP Comment: Why stop at 918 ppmv? Why not go to the Cambrian explosion of aquatic animal life about 540 million years ago with CO2 levels about 7,000 ppmv?] While MSM Screamed “Climate Crisis”, Arctic Ice Loss Actually Slowed By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Aug 21, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Changing Weather Hurricane Erin By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 19, 2025 It is now commonplace for hurricane hunter aircraft to spend hours flying inside hurricanes, even far from Florida as Erin was on Saturday. Consequently, they are much more likely to spot a short-lived spike in just one small area of the eyewall. Planes are now much more robust with longer range and can stay in the air longer. The WP-3D Orion, for example, has a range of about 3,800 nautical miles and can fly up to 10-12 hours, sufficient for most hurricane missions. The Gulfstream IV-SP has an even longer range of 4200 nautical miles. People adapt to extreme heat By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Aug 20, 2025 Link to paper: Outpacing climate change: adaptation to heatwaves in Europe By Marcin Piotr Walkowiak, et al., International Journal of Biometeorology, Feb 19, 2025 Robson: The bottom line is people are clever and can adapt to changing circumstances, including warmer weather, as long as governments don’t get in the way by assuming they’re stupid and making the necessary adaptations costlier while wasting money on strategies that don’t do any good. Since governments so often take precisely that approach, it’s a wonder the authors found as much evidence of adaptation as they did. Changing Climate – Cultures & Civilizations The Mayan climate extremes and megadroughts of the Medieval era By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Aug 20, 2025 Link to paper: Classic Maya response to multiyear seasonal droughts in Northwest Yucatán, Mexico By Daniel H. James, et al., AAAS Science Advances, Aug 13, 2025 From abstract: We present a subannual rainfall record from northwest Yucatán, Mexico, derived from an annually laminated stalagmite spanning 871 to 1021 CE, with ±6-year age uncertainty. Interpretation of the stalagmite oxygen isotope record is supported by modern rain and drip water monitoring. Changing Seas New Study: Corals Thrived In Warmer-Than-Today Temps And When Sea Levels Were Meters Higher By Kenneth Richard, No Tricks Zone, Aug 19, 2025 Link to paper: Impact of Holocene relative sea-level changes on patch reef-island development in the Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia By Michael G Hynes, et al., The Holocene, 2025 From abstract: Here, we present data of 16 cores from two islands of different reef zones from the Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Cores were taken from the reef flat and slope, with recovered length varying from 0.41 to 3.53m, providing a history of each reef after radiocarbon dating. From 7200 to 5500 YBP, sea level rise rapidly increased and these reef complexes accreted at rates able to match this. This is in part driven by a higher occurrence of massive and foliose corals. After this point and toward the present day, sea level declined, causing sub-aerial exposure of these sand cays and the slope now sustaining the growth. Antarctic phytoplankton trends reveal sea ice retreat impact; Ecosystem engineering in the oceans By Erica Marchand, Paris, France (SPX), Aug 15, 2025 Link to paper: Antarctic phytoplankton communities restructure under shifting sea-ice regimes By Alexander Hayward, et al., Nature Climate Change, July 25, 2025 From Abstract: Here, using a machine learning framework and combining pigment samples and environmental samples from austral summertime 1997–2023, we show declines in diatoms and increases in haptophytes and cryptophytes across much of Antarctica’s continental shelf. These trends—which are linked to sea ice increases—reversed after 2016, with a rebound in diatoms and a large increase in cryptophytes, coinciding with the loss of sea ice. The long-term shifts in phytoplankton assemblages could reduce the dominance of the krill-centric food web and diminish the biologically mediated export of carbon to depth, with implications for the global-ocean carbon sink.

The so-called Grey Lady of journalism should be blushing in shame. The paper quickly corrects errors that are of minor importance to most readers, such as misspelled names, incorrect job titles, or inaccurate event dates. However, when substantive factual errors are identified and reported to the paper, as in the examples discussed above, its response is to either stonewall, as in the case of the Bearak article, or to obfuscate and evade, as in its correction of the comparison of renewable and fossil fuel generation levels in the Wallace-Wells article.

Nothing says global warming like a trend of 0.03°C per decade. For decades they told us that Antarctica would warm twice as fast as most of the world. What happened to that? Nothing. To put it bluntly, it was warmer in Antarctica a thousand years ago, and two thousand years ago the penguins survived just fine. In fact, The Penguin Optimum (they really call it that) was three or four thousand years ago when it was even warmer still. (Hall et al 2023). It was the horrible cold of the Little Ice Age that wiped out thousands of penguins. Lord forbid, that animals that manage to survive in the coldest place on Earth would want it to be even colder.

In 2019 the CSIRO Blob Experts bravely assumed that the modeled average capacity factor of onshore wind would be 44.4%. Years later, in the latest GenCOST report they assume, like an addict, that it would between 29% “and 48%” — still fantasizing that a miracle is about to come. So, their modeled prediction of the cost of onshore wind power is ridiculously generous. Even after reality doggedly stayed around 30% for six years, a google search shows the NSW government “fact sheet” says it’s around 35% and the Google AI overview says it’s 30% “to 45%.” Fossil Fuel Fightback: The gears shift on the Renewable Crash Test Dummy — Eraring coal lives, wind and solar slump By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Aug 16, 2025 Think of the irony of putting the nation’s biggest battery next to the nation’s biggest coal plant, as if it needed back up: Energy Issues — US Green Energy Wall Coming Into Focus In New York? By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Aug 17, 2025 Supposedly, under a statute known as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019, we are faced with a 2030 deadline to get some 70% of our electricity from “renewables.” Currently the percent of our electricity that we get from these “renewables” is around 44%, and almost half of that comes from the gigantic waterfall known as Niagara Falls. Without another Niagara Falls on the horizon, theoretically we should be building vast fields of wind turbines and solar panels to meet the statutory mandates; but that effort has stalled out, and the costs of wind and solar generation, and of backup to make the grid run all the time, have barely started to show up in consumer bills. Nor have various big new long-distance transmission projects yet come into consumer bills. Electricity Bills Too High? Bad Energy Policies Are to Blame. By Megan Martin, Real Clear Energy, Aug 18, 2025 Washington’s Control of Energy Trump Administration Further Restricts Tax Credits for Solar and Wind Energy By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, Aug 15, 2025 Link to guidance: Beginning of Construction Requirements for Purposes of the Termination of Clean Electricity Production Credits and Clean Electricity Investment Credits for Applicable Wind and Solar Facilities By Staff, Treasury Department Notice 2025-42, Aug 15, 2025 Click to access august-15-treasury-guidance.pdf From article: The guidance is expected to stall or halt “hundreds” of planned wind and solar projects, according to some industry analysts, though others such as Ozkan said it could whittle out projects that likely would not have been built regardless of tax credits. Adrian Deveny, founder and president of Climate Vision, a policy advisory firm, in comments to POLITICO, cautioned the new guidance would “pull the rug out from under the entire pipeline of wind and solar projects that are in development.” Deveny previously served as a policy director for New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and worked on the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. [Boldface added] Trump Prompts $19 Billion Worth of Wind and Solar Projects Cancellations By Irina Slav, Oil Price.com, Aug 22, 2025 Meanwhile, energy transition proponents are warning that this course of action may compromise energy supply security for data centers. Wind and solar, however, cannot generate electricity around the clock, which is another key part of the equation that most pro-transition analysts consistently ignore. [SEPP Comment: How many dollars in tax credits will be restored to the Federal Treasury?] EXCLUSIVE: Trump Admin Kills Massive Offshore Wind Project By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Aug 22, 2025 Trump administration halts offshore wind project in Rhode Island By Amalia Huot-Marchand, The Hill, Aug 22, 2025 The Trump administration on Friday issued an order stopping all activities of a wind energy project in Rhode Island that could have supplied electricity to 350,000 homes. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in a letter sent to Ørsted, the Danish company operating the project, said the stop work order seeks “to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas.” [SEPP Comment: The article ignores that wind power is part time; when is unknown.] USDA limits funding for solar, wind on farmland By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Aug 19, 2025 Trump administration launches national security investigation into wind turbine imports By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Aug 21, 2025 Oil and Natural Gas – the Future or the Past?

That means the 600 MWh from Thurrock will keep the grid doing for 48 seconds! Not even that, in fact, because the battery will never be fully drained. According to Statera, the battery storage secured debt financing of £144 million, all of which will of course have to be paid back via our electricity bills: California Dreaming California Can’t Stop Owning Itself In Ongoing Wind And Solar Debacle By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Aug 18, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Newsom Begs Oil Producers not to Abandon California By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Aug 19, 2025 Don’t they realize $8 / gallon pump price in California could torpedo Newsom’s presidential ambitions?

End of a Green Delusion Flummoxed as always, environmentalists may yet get a carbon tax thanks to Trump. By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., WSJ, Aug. 19, 2025 TWTW Summary: The article begins with: “Get out your notepads, social scientists. A ‘preference falsification’ bubble is about to go pop in the realm of climate policy. The term comes from Duke University’s Timur Kuran, for when people feel pressured to adopt and exhibit ideas they don’t believe in. One such bubble was born under near-laboratory conditions in December 2008. The incoming Obama administration decided, with Republicans vacating the White House, the ‘existential’ threat of climate change no longer merited unpopular energy taxes. Subsidies to its green-energy cronies would suffice. In haste, the climate movement prostrated itself before this idea, as did the mainstream press, though it was nonsense. This year Donald Trump has done the world a favor by defunding the green-energy elite and its policy substrate. In the strange way of events, greens now can free themselves from false fealty to a nonsolution. But it’s going to take a long unwinding, especially the morass of electric vehicle subsidies. A lagging indicator is the Princeton University-related Repeat Project, previously mocked here for its hard sell of Joe Biden’s worthless Inflation Reduction Act. Today its principal, Jesse Jenkins, and colleagues are making the rounds keening over the death of Mr. Biden’s handiwork. In a New York Times podcast, they rattle on in the usual way: Green energy is good. Therefore, subsidies for green energy are good. As in Soviet economics, inputs are rejoiced in—more windmills, more solar farms. Outputs are ignored—rising emissions, artificially goosed energy consumption. Though it does nothing for the climate given the shrinking global significance of U.S. emissions, U.S. ‘net zero’ is still a ‘moral imperative’—never mind that U.S. net zero would be achieved mainly by shifting U.S. emissions overseas.” The author discusses in 2022 net zero mandate was inhibiting those seeking a carbon tax and then concludes with: “A carbon tax isn’t undoable in the U.S. context, I’ve long argued; it’s been forcibly kept off the agenda by Democrats who can smell but refuse to pursue the obvious deal with Republicans in return for income-tax cuts. A carbon tax is a consumption tax. So are Mr. Trump’s import tariffs. Already the blogosphere has been lighting up over how Mr. Trump’s chaotic start might be repurposed for a pro-growth, pro-debt reduction tax reform. You didn’t have to look far for the truth. It was everywhere except the mainstream media, the New York Times being the worst. I’ve pointed frequently to the 2013 National Science Foundation report funded by congressional Democrats themselves. Richard York of the University of Oregon, no apologist for capitalism or fossil fuels, has also shown why green energy doesn’t displace fossil fuels. French energy historian Jean-Baptiste Fressoz’s previous book decried the anthropocene—i.e., humanity’s effect on the planet. His new best-seller explains the fraudulence of the so-called energy transition. Last year the prestigious journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science should have closed the verdict on this faulty experiment. It found virtually all the world’s climate policies to be failing. Why? They mistook concessionary funding of green energy for cutting emissions. In Foreign Affairs, Obama brain-truster Peter Orszag delivers the coup de grace: ‘Rather than replacing conventional energy sources, the growth of renewables is coming on top of that of conventional sources.’ No kidding. A world-historical boondoggle might have been avoided long ago. It needed only a media that did its job of holding a mirror up to reality rather than pathetically flailing after consumers who’ll pay to have their self-images confirmed. For some greens the wake-up call will never come. They’re little more than shills for industries that know they won’t be favored under a carbon tax. Their survival depends on direct government support for fake solutions to a climate problem that itself remains inescapably, in some sense, theoretical. The damage to other things Americans care about, such as jobs and economic dynamism, has been incalculable. On the eve of the Obama preference-falsification election, this column said the only live question was how much the U.S would spend on climate change to have no effect on climate change. The answer will be in the trillions.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Good point, and exactly how much warming is that significant warming from methane projected to be? You can diligently search the net and you are not likely to find an answer. A Google search on “Business as usual, how much global warming is methane on track to produce by 2100?” turns up this: Under a business-as-usual scenario, methane is projected to contribute to a global temperature increase of more than 3.0°C by 2100. Doesn’t say how much the contribution is. If anyone thinks it’s significantly more than ~0.05°C, they should pipe up with their work and source. “Water vapor feedback is positive: a warmer atmosphere might have more water vapor, which itself is a powerful greenhouse gas.” A wildly inaccurate and misleading statement! A “warmer atmosphere” does not just “have” more water vapor, it takes the heat energy of one K of a kilogram of CO2 to convert one gram of water into water vapor at a constant temperature. This vapor then transports this energy 3 t0 10 km up to where the energy of condensation is released, again without heating the air, creating clouds that cool the Earth both by reflecting incoming radiation and by radiating the transported energy. In sum, the total water cycle is a highly negative feedback process for atmospheric temperature. The atmosphere cannot be usefully studied using only thermometer readings, much less just the arithmetic averages of those readings!

Title: Publisher Payment Plans; The Details Of Retail Data Deals

A Change Of Heart Publishers are hopeful that Meta may have changed its tune at least somewhat when it comes to how – or whether – the platform reimburses publishers for content contributed to its LLM models. Following up on an IAB Tech Lab event at which Meta and Google participated alongside publishers, Digiday reports on cautious optimism among pubs that Meta’s recent hiring spree of AI engineering leaders has led to a greater appreciation of the value of original written content. That’s quite a different vibe than Meta was putting out there as recently as last year. Last September, on The Verge’s Decoder podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content.” Reading between the lines, if creators don’t want to participate in feeding AI models because they’re not being properly compensated, then maybe the AI models will just skip over them. Although, not to be a cynic, that might be a moot point, considering all the data scraping that’s been going on. Also, we’ll believe it when we see it – publicly. “They [Meta] were very clear that their stance on this has changed,” one anonymous publisher tells Digiday. “Even though it may not have outwardly turned into action yet.” Data (Fee) Leak Times are tough for The Trade Desk. Its stock price sank after investors questioned its strategy for competing with walled gardens. Meanwhile, competitors are gunning for their slices of open web advertising and the growing CTV and retail media markets. Now, a document leak has revealed what advertisers pay for targeting data sourced from TTD’s retail media partners, Adweek reports. The document, which was last updated June 15, also includes the minimum ad spend required to create custom audiences or conduct campaign measurement using retailer data. When advertisers use retail media data to target ads, they pay the retailer a percentage of the campaign’s CPM capped at a set amount. For example, targeting with Costco’s data might cost 40% of the CPM, but won’t exceed $4 per 1,000 impressions. It’s unclear whether TTD keeps a portion of the data fees for itself. The hard caps are in place because CPMs are much higher for CTV ad buys than online display campaigns, and retail media data is commonly used for CTV targeting. The leak also sheds light on TTD’s no-longer-exclusive ad tech partnership with Walmart’s DSP, including a $150,000 spending minimum and a 75-cent CPM fee for sales lift measurement. However, Walmart says those are old figures, so it’ll be interesting to see what other DSPs will charge for Walmart’s data. Giving Privacy The Finger Fingerprinting has a bad reputation. But opinions on the controversial tracking strategy seem to be shifting. The IAB Tech Lab is even defending it. Audience fingerprinting identifies and tracks devices or users based on unique digital traits like browser settings and software and hardware configurations, without relying on cookies or device IDs. A fingerprint can include everything from web browser type and version, a device’s operating system, the size of the screen, language settings and many other signals. Platforms combine these data points, none of which alone can specifically identify a person, to create a probabilistic user ID. Critics say fingerprinting threatens user privacy, since people can’t opt out. Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and others prohibit the practice. But Google, which also once banned fingerprinting, reversed course back in January. And now the IAB Tech Lab is also waving away concerns. At the AdMonsters Sell Side Summit in Nashville last week, Tech Lab CEO Anthony Katsur gave a rundown of the trade org’s recent initiatives, including its new Trusted Server framework. In describing how the server uses first-party data to create synthetic IDs, Katsur acknowledged, but also diminished, criticisms that the framework promotes fingerprinting – perhaps drawing on his tense exchange with Sincera’s Mike O’Sullivan in March. “Oh, it’s fingerprinting,” he said in a mocking tone. “Sure, let’s fucking call it fingerprinting.” You heard the man!

August 24, 2025 23:54 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “This is our 17th weekly update. Many of you have asked whether our “Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge” eco-strategy could lead to distraction or drift. In fact, it is the opposite. This is not about losing focus, but about strengthening our foundation. Automaking is a long-cycle, high-investment, and slow-return industry. One of the core challenges FF is facing is that: before hitting positive operating cash flow, how do promote long-term and stable capital supply. Our C10 Treasury is designed for this. By accumulating and compounding the world’s Top 10 crypto coin portfolio, it has the potential to provide continuous and sustained capital support for our main business — EAI EV, truly delivering dual-engine growth from both capital and industry.” On Friday last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut may come as early as September. His remarks gave a major boost to capital markets. U.S. equities moved higher, while crypto reacted faster and stronger. The market priced in liquidity easing more directly, creating a clear upside for our C10 Treasury, as the C10 Index was up nearly 6% on Friday. This week, both flywheels achieved important progress: On S1 User Ecosystem: The influence of our “Dual Flywheel + Dual Bridge” unveiling event continues to grow in the U.S. It has sparked meta-chemistry. Cross-sector outreach in automotive, finance, and Web3 created a multi-domain resonance. As a result, FF and FX received cross-industry attention that far exceeded expectations. We will double our efforts to quickly elevate FF and FX’s influence in the U.S. market to another level. Looking at S2–S3: Product & Technology:This week, FX Super One successfully completed the first round of development tests for occupant upper interior impact protection under U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). FMVSS is recognized as one of the world’s most complete and rigorous automotive safety regulations. It is a prerequisite for entering the U.S. market and also sets standards for automotive design, manufacturing, and testing worldwide. FX Super One must meet the requirements of the U.S., the Middle East, and future global markets. This requires testing at the highest standards. We will continue advancing vehicle testing, development, and validation to build a strong foundation for Super One’s high safety standards. Moving on to S4, Product Execution & Delivery: This week, we visited the Hanford manufacturing facility to oversee FX Super One’s trial production. Thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing team, around 60% of the trial production process planning has already been completed. Next, the team will continue comprehensive validation of production processes, refine work procedures, establish and enhance the quality control system, and carry out dedicated skill training in parallel. Lastly, on S5 Capital Markets and finance:The first dedicated $30 million financing commitment for C10 Treasury closed this week. We expect to begin the first round of asset allocation next week. Our plan is to gradually deploy the full $30 million over the coming weeks. 80% will be allocated passively according to the C10 Index, while 20% will be actively managed. We will share portfolio holdings and performance updates in future weekly reports. C10 Treasury, as a short-cycle, fast-paced, high-value, and cash-cow investment due to steady staking interests, could serve as the financial engine of the entire listed company FFAI, and help accelerate the implementation and execution of the EAI EV strategy. Next week:Our Super One co-creation and sales campaign will officially kick off across eight U.S. states. Over the next weekend, I will make a short trip to the Nevada desert, bringing FX Super One to Burning Man. We also plan to announce an important update there. Burning Man has become a global utopia where leading minds in technology, art, and business pursue creativity and idealism. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are regulars there, and Google’s founders once recruited Eric Schmidt at Burning Man. Schmidt went on to lead Google for a decade, driving its rapid expansion and cementing Google’s dominance in the Web2 era. Starting August 28, Super One will also make its debut in Massachusetts, where we and our FF Par partners will host two consecutive co-creation and sales events in the Boston area. At the same time, our New York–based B2B partner Alps will launch a week-long roadshow campaign. On August 30, FF headquarters will host a special event — the inaugural North America “Go-Global Stand-Up Comedy Festival” and FX Super One Showcase. Joe Wong, the first Chinese stand-up comedian to have roasted a U.S. president live at the White House, will join entrepreneurs, founders, and global expansion pioneers for co-creation and exchange. We will see you next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: Dow eyes fresh highs as Nvidia gets set to report earnings amid AI bubble fears

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Stock futures edged up on Sunday evening as Wall Street looks ahead to another big week that will feature earnings from AI chip leader Nvidia and another inflation update. Markets are coming off a monster rally on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a rate cut next month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.05%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.06%. On Friday, the Dow hit a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in on their records. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.256% after diving Friday on rate-cut expectations. The U.S. dollar was down 0.02% against the euro and flat against the yen. Gold fell 0.13% to $3,413.80 per ounce. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2% to $63.79 per barrel, and Brent crude added 0.15% to reach $67.83. Friday’s stock surge came after a big selloff that was led by tech giants, as doubts have grown about the AI boom and how much it will actually help companies. That’s after a recent report from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs at businesses are failing to produce much of a return. Adding to those concerns were remarks from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble. Wall Street’s faith in the staying power of AI as an investment thesis will be put to the test when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday. The report also comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to an unprecedented deal where they give the federal government a 15% cut of their chip sales to China. For now, demand from U.S. companies remains high as so-called hyperscaler tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms alone are expected to deploy $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, and most of that is going to AI. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is due as policymakers wait and see how much of an effect on inflation President Donald Trump’s tariffs are having. Earlier updates on the consumer price index and the producer price index were mixed, and analysts expect the personal consumption expenditures index for July to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a yearly basis, the same annual rate as June. But the core PCE is seen climbing 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on a yearly basis, accelerating from June’s 2.8% annual rate. Still, some Fed officials, including Powell, have indicated that tariff-related impacts on inflation may be short-term and that more attention should go to the labor market, which has shown signs of weakening. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: What I learned about productivity this year
URL: https://www.platformer.news/productivity-tools-ai-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-24T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
What I gave up, what I kept, and what's new. PLUS: How I'm using AI Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year. Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why. Let's get into it. In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself. I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year. With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year. Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion. Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here. Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community. I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast. I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway? Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself. It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free. Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it. I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward. Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him. Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself. That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things: For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!) And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write! Two years ago, I wrote this: This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved. I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database. This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became. One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf. Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper. Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date. If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same. But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it. On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children. And finally, I introduce Kevin to the wild world of "shock slop" — AI-generated songs meant to freak out your parents.

Title: 6 Things To Know About The Meta/Google Cloud AI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/08/23/6-things-to-know-about-the-metagoogle-cloud-ai-deal/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T14:36:08Z

ByJohn Werner, Contributor. Meta’s new deal with Google for AI cloud hosting comes with a big price tag — the deal is reportedly worth $10 billion. That’s the equivalent of 666 million large pizzas — or two for each person in the U.S. It’s also equal to the GDP of a small country. So what’s behind this monolithic business agreement? Here are some interesting aspects of this newly announced tech partnership. The $10 billion deal with Google is part of a Meta plan to invest a total of over $100 billion in AI. Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about this kind of scaling up, as the company lays off significant numbers of human workers, moves the survivors to departments that are heavier on AI and automates business processes like it’s going out of style. The proclaimed “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 saw a lot of this action, and Meta doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The deal also lasts until 2031, by which time we might have superhuman agents, godlike AGI and brand-new national economies built on crypto or some more out-there foundation. So you could be forgiven for imagining that, for all practical purposes, Google and Meta are essentially going to the altar and not just making a short-term deal when it comes to tech allegiances. Another thing to know about this deal is that it is, to some extent, a stopgap solution and part of the greater debate for large companies like Meta about “build vs. buy” — that is, whether it is better to use an outside vendor’s resources or build them internally. That extends to models as well as data centers: as LLMs became more ubiquitous, companies had to decide whether to run their AI applications on someone else’s model (cough cough, OpenAI) or build one themselves. And to be clear, OpenAI does have competitors, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t have that many. In terms of data center planning, Meta already has fairly concrete plans for Prometheus and Hyperion, which are projected to provide 1 gigawatt and 5 gigawatts, respectively, over time. So after that six years, we could see a very different landscape emerging. In offering services in the cloud AI market, Google goes up against a formidable competitor. AWS has been the household brand for cloud practically since the beginning, and by now, the firm has launched AWS Bedrock, where users can actually choose among top models from OpenAI, DeepSeek or others, including Anthropic (AWS was an early backer of Claude). But the new agreement gives Google a boost in AI cloud and reportedly led to a 32% increase in revenue for the company since the deal was announced. Another part of the context is how customers, particularly smaller ones, feel about Google’s cloud services, including the new AI provisioning. Presumably, Meta would not be worried about a rug pull in terms of deprecation, but notes in places like Reddit show that others ponder whether Google Cloud is “going to last” in the competitive environment and, alternately, whether Google will choose to deprecate services. Google’s documentation reveals that Google services are subject to deprecation, so that’s something to keep in mind, but doesn’t necessarily mean that something like that is in the cards or that the company will be “churning” services and rocking smaller customers out of the boat. Regardless of its deal with Meta, Google isn’t just in the business of offering bulk. Its GCP also offers feature services like BigQuery, a serverless data warehouse, and TensorFlow, an open-source ML framework enabling multi-dimensional arrays. There’s a Kubernetes engine, object storage and more, helping the company to rival AWS’ ecosystem approach. Here are some more of Google’s AI offerings: Vertex AI: Google Cloud’s unified platform for building, training, deploying and managing machine learning models with integrated MLOps tools. Generative AI Studio: Vertex AI tool for creating, fine-tuning and deploying generative AI models using prompts and customization. Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech: prebuilt AI APIs. Vision AI: cloud-based service that analyzes images and videos, detecting objects, text, faces and visual patterns using machine learning. All of this is going to help the company to remain a powerhouse in AI cloud along with AWS and Microsoft. The deal is notable partly because of its size and partly because it involves not one but two of the companies included in the former acronym FAANG, which represented the five top tech companies in America. That list has shifted a bit, notably, with the emergence of Nvidia as king of the stock market, but Meta and Google are still two titans. Stay tuned for more.

Title: Can AI ‘sorcery’ solve the ‘productivity paradox’ that has gripped the economy for 25 years? A Shakespearean sea change is underfoot
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/23/worker-productivity-ai-bofa-automation-inflation-do-more-with-less-sea-change/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T10:04:00Z

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. The late plays by William Shakespeare are alternately called his “romances” or his “problem plays,” because of their ambiguity in tone, as they alternate from passages of magical realism to stark scenes that grapple with complex social issues. At times, they point the way toward the prestige TV of the early 21st century where, for instance, The Sopranos could range from broad comedy to intense violence to avant-garde dream sequences, all in one episode. It’s from the romances that we get phrases that stick with us today, like the description from The Tempest of a “sea change into something rich and strange.” Full disclosure: The author’s brother is an eminent Shakespearean scholar, often quoted in The New York Times, although never previously in Fortune, and so I asked him to explain what this particular term means. “Toward the end of his career,” Drew Lichtenberg of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC, said in a statement to Fortune, “Shakespeare started writing genre-defying plays with sudden and miraculous changes of fortune.” Shakespeare used the phrase “sea change” to describe a “magical storm at sea that has the power to snuff out life or restore it in less than a second.” What do Shakespeare’s plays of miraculous changes of fortune have to do with, well, Fortune? Bank of America Institute has projected a “sea change” in the economy. It sees a pivotal transformation in worker productivity at America’s largest companies, driven by lessons from post-pandemic inflation and supercharged by a wave of artificial intelligence and automation. The institute worked hand in hand with projections from Bank of America Research to project a rewiring of the fundamental valuation landscape of the S&P 500, with profound implications for investors and the “quality premium” that U.S. stocks traditionally command. Fortune talked to BofA Research’s Head of US Equity & Quantitative Strategy, Savita Subramanian, to dig into this change, potentially to something rich and strange. It’s not quite that mystical, she said, but she still thinks it’s a big deal. Subramanian explained that what her team has projected isn’t as exciting or dramatic as having actual wizards working at the gears of the economy. The more prosaic insight, she says, is that the combination of AI technology and lessons learned from the inflation wave of the 2020s mean that worker productivity is finally showing signs of increasing. That’s the sea change taking place. At its heart, her work is all about the famous “productivity paradox” identified by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow. “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,” he said in 1987, long before the productivity crisis of the 21st century set in. As Fortune‘s Jeremy Kahn has discussed, workers still don’t seem to be getting more productive despite the bevy of new technologies at their disposal. In fact, McKinsey’s Chris White and Olivia White argued in 2024 that productivity has been dismal for nearly a generation, hovering around 1% a year, with a dip after the Great Financial Crisis. Subramanian agrees, telling Fortune that if you look at productivity measures, “they haven’t really improved all that much since 2001.” Subramanian wrote on Aug. 8 that the end goal of the massive AI spending that’s rippling through the economy is a “sea-change” in the scale and scope of efficiency gains—and this productivity cycle is already under way. Post-pandemic wage inflation forced companies “to do more with fewer people,” she added, and now AI tools are due to kick that up a notch. But the official stats don’t show a complete understanding of how productivity really functions, Subramanian explained. So BofA took sales, adjusted for inflation, and then divided sales by the number of people working at S&P 500 companies, showing real sales growth versus number of people, what she called a “decent proxy” for productivity, “because if you’re productive, you are doing things more efficiently, you need less labor. And this is more labor efficiency than anything else.” Look at what she found. This means companies are learning to do more with less, and that is kind of magical. Companies have had to do harder work to generate earnings and keep margins healthy, often by replacing their people with processes. “A process is almost free and it’s replicable for eternity,” she said, adding that she thinks this is why the companies exercising efficiency gains have tended to outperform. It’s not only about AI displacing workers, but a fundamental shift in how business is being done. This discussion may seem on its face to be more boring than a tempest and a wizard, she said, but there is something supernatural about the current moment. “I think people love this AI technology because it feels like sorcery,” she said, before adding, “the truth is it hasn’t really changed the world that much yet, but I don’t think it’s something to be dismissed.” Overall, Subramanian finds the S&P 500 has shifted from its 1980s model of asset- and labor-intensive manufacturing to asset- and labor-light innovation, namely tech and health care firms. Showing her work, she calculates that the S&P 500 firms with a focus on innovation, measured through high research and development expenditures, trade at structurally higher multiples of 29x forward earnings per share. More capital-intensive manufacturers, on the other hand, trade at a 21x multiple. The current AI boom is actually a bit risky, she wrote, because the massive data center investments represent a shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavier focus. To be sure, BofA finds that the S&P 500 is now statistically expensive on 19 out of the 20 metrics that they track, including P/E, price to book, price to cash flow, and market cap/GDP. That’s where the sea change matters, because if the shift from manufacturing to innovation is real, then valuations have to shift as well. Hence the “innovation premium” from BofA’s research. Excluding Tesla, Subramanian talks about the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” as evidence of firms losing some of their innovation premium as a result of a shift toward asset-heaviness. As a basket of stocks, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Apple’s average shareholder yield (i.e., dividends plus net buybacks) has dropped by over 1% since 2015. There are other shifts afoot as well, she told Fortune. “We seem to be at least pausing on this globalization theme,” she said, citing China’s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a big driver of margin expansion, enabling cost-cutting as a huge lever to keep margins expanding. (It was also the year when worker productivity froze in its tracks.) In the globalization regime, “you didn’t have to think too hard to make money and expand your margins,” she said. It was “very easy and fungible and frictionless” for companies to buy things from different places and contain costs. She also cited the low-interest-rate environment that persisted for much of the past few decades, enabling lots of “financial engineering.” For example, Subramanian said it was common to see companies that knew they would miss their earnings estimates borrowing money and buying back stock to hit their targets, adding the caveat that “there are good reasons to do share buybacks and bad reasons to do share buybacks.” This all “really created a lot of bizarre behavior.” Warren Buffett’s long-time fondness for stock buybacks has even come under fire from other investors, with Jeremy Grantham writing in 2023 that it facilitates stock manipulation and should be illegal. BofA Research found in July 2025, however, that stock buybacks had decelerated a bit, albeit they remained high by historical standards. The situation now is harder in many ways, but companies aren’t able to financially engineer their way to earnings growth, she added. Now that’s a sea change. One final note on the Shakespearean romances, from Drew Lichtenberg: that appellation came about in the late 1700s, nearly two centuries after Shakespeare’s lifetime, with the birth of the romantic movement. The word “romantic” had previously existed, but it didn’t have its current meaning until Samuel Taylor Coleridge elevated it to mean something that connects back directly to nature and the divine genius of humanity’s self-expression. This was largely a response to the Enlightenment’s elevation of reason and logic and its ultimate achievement: the Industrial Revolution that unleashed modern capitalism on the world. A sea change, indeed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Media Stocks, Markets Soar As Fed Chief Signals September Rate Cut – “The Balance Of Risks Appears To Be Shifting”

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor It’s been a long wait but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell energized stocks today as he cracked open the door to a possible interest rate cut at the Central Bank’s September meeting. In his keynote address at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said that “the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” The Fed hasn’t cut rates since December of 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 800 points or 1.9% to close at a record. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% and the 1.9%. It was an upbeat finale to a dour week rattled by AI jitters that pounded tech stocks. They rallied today along with media. Warner Bros. Discovery rose 4%. Disney and Comcast closed up 2%.

Paramount Skydance slipped as well after a massive run-up approaching meme stock status over the past few weeks. Deadline reported this afternoon that the newly merged company is planning thousands of layoffs. Watch on Deadline Exhibitors rose nicely led by AMC and Imax. Broadcasters posted gains amid M&A as Nexstar (up 1%) bid to acquire Tegna (flat). Charter, in the process of buying Cox, was up 4%. Amazon, Apple and Meta rose. Roku gained as shares from Sirius to Snap to Fubo. The Fed’s dual mandate is price stability and maximum employment. That’s been a major challenge as inflation went wild post-Covid and it took rate hike after hike to wrestle down toward the central bank’s traditional 2% benchmark. Powell said inflation risk is still “tilted to the upside” with tariff related price impacts now “clearly visible.” “We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem,” he said. However, the labor market is seeing “a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” he said. He called it an unusual situation which “suggests that downside risks to employment are rising” and that “the balance of risks appears to be shifting.” There’s been a lot of noise around U.S. economic indicators. President Donald Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner late last month after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near halt. The president also wants lower interest rates and has publicly lambasted Powell, frequently threatening to eject the chairman before his term ends next spring. Markets don’t react well when he does that so he’s always backed down. Trump is, however, calling for the resignation of Fed Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. Trump loyalist Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage — a controversy that is hanging over the Jackson Hole event.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 22 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»Showcase»I Tested 7 AI Tools for Content Marketing: Here’s What I Found By Nouman Yaqoob | August 20, 2025 | Reader Disclosure I have been using AI tools since ChatGPT first launched. And like many content marketers, I wanted to improve my skills for the AI era. This means I frequently test a wide range of AI tools as part of my actual content marketing workflow. This regular testing has helped me move past the noise and identify which tools genuinely save time and improve content quality for other bloggers and marketers. My goal was to find what helps drive traffic and engagement, not just add another subscription to the list. In this guide, I’ll share that clarity with you. Here are my recommendations for the best AI tools for content marketers, based on my daily use and the results I got from them. If you are in a hurry, here is a quick list of all the AI tools I use in my daily workflow as a content marketer: TL:DR Summary: Draft content with ChatGPT, verify with Gemini, optimize with AIOSEO, build in SeedProd, design in Canva, create a video with Runway, and add voiceovers with ElevenLabs. Next, I’ll show how I tested each tool and why you can trust my picks. The AI industry is exploding with innovation, making it harder to separate hype from reality, and choosing the wrong tool can waste time and money. I aim to cut through the noise with real-world usage to save time and money. Here’s a breakdown of my testing process: As a content creator at WPBeginner, I use marketing tools daily to create and promote content for our millions of readers. Our team also uses plugins like All in One SEO and SeedProd across our business, so we have direct, first-hand experience with how their AI features perform. Furthermore, everyone at WPBeginner follows a strict editorial process to ensure our reviews are always thorough, fair, and trustworthy. My recommendations come from hands-on experience and a commitment to helping you find the right tools to succeed. Best For: Content writing, brainstorming, illustrations, and organizing marketing workflows. ChatGPT is one of the most versatile AI tools I’ve used. It works well for quick idea generation, long-form articles, and even creative media like images. As one of the most advanced AI companies, OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is spending huge resources on research and innovation. This means more capable and faster models are released quite frequently. ChatGPT allows you to switch between search, chat, deep research, and agent modes so you can perform different types of tasks from the same window. How I use ChatGPT: ChatGPT is my primary AI for a variety of tasks. I use it daily for updating existing articles, brainstorming blog post ideas, writing new articles, and more. I learned that using Projects and ChatGPT’s memory feature allows the AI to learn my preferred tone, structure, and formatting rules. This saves me a lot of time in the long run. I also use it to create illustrations for articles and general blog images. It sometimes misspells words in images, but I can easily correct those using Photoshop or Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: A free plan is available with limited model access. Paid plan starts at $20/month, GPT-5, memory features, faster responses, and priority access during peak times. Best For: In-depth research, fact-checking, and writing technical or data-driven content. While ChatGPT is my go-to for creative tasks, Gemini is my trusted research assistant. Its biggest advantage is its direct, real-time integration with the Google search index, which means the information it provides is current and often comes with source links. This makes it incredibly reliable for tasks where accuracy is critical. I’ve found its ability to understand and explain complex, technical subjects is second to none. It’s also excellent at generating structured data like tables and comparing information from multiple sources. Plus, Google is continually updating Gemini with its latest AI models and connecting it with its ecosystem of Google Workspace apps like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. These integrations make it a powerful productivity hub. How I use Gemini: I turn to Gemini whenever I need to write content that requires up-to-date information or fact-checking. For instance, when writing a review of a new software release, I’ll ask Gemini to summarize the latest features, find recent user reviews, and compare its pricing to competitors. I also use it to simplify technical topics. When working on an article about website security, I can ask Gemini to explain “what is a DDoS attack” in a simple analogy that a non-technical reader can understand. Its ability to provide sourced information saves me a significant amount of research time. Related Article: See my pick of the best ChatGPT alternatives. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: The standard Gemini model is free to use. To access the most powerful models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) and larger context windows, you can subscribe to Google AI Pro, which starts at $19.99/month as part of the Google One AI Pro plan. Best For: Creating SEO-optimized titles, meta descriptions, FAQs, key points, and social media posts directly inside WordPress. All in One SEO’s AI Content Generator is built right into your WordPress dashboard, making it incredibly easy to create ranking-ready content without switching between tools. You can instantly generate: Because it’s part of the AIOSEO plugin, all the AI-generated content can be inserted into your post or page with a single click. This helps you save time and ensure everything is properly optimized for search engines and engagement. How I use AIOSEO AI Content Generator: I use AIOSEO’s AI content generator when I need to speed up the optimization process for new and updated articles. For example, after writing a post, I’ll use the AI Content Generator to create a compelling meta description, add FAQ blocks for featured snippets, and generate a TL;DR section to improve readability. It’s also my go-to for creating platform-specific social media captions. I can generate tailored copy for Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and X (Twitter) in seconds, which saves me from rewriting the same message multiple times. Plus, I love its Marketing Email feature, which allows you to instantly generate an email based on the content of your article. Note: All in One SEO is the most comprehensive WordPress SEO tool. We use it on all our websites, including WPBeginner. To learn more, see our full AIOSEO review. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Available for both Lite and Pro users. Lite users get 100 free credits, with additional credits available for purchase. Pro users get generous credits included with their license. All users can buy extra credits at any time. Best For: Creating landing page copy, headlines, and unique images directly inside the WordPress page builder. SeedProd is one of the most popular WordPress website and landing page builders. Alongside its drag-and-drop builder, it comes with built-in AI tools for text and image creation. It integrates with ChatGPT for copywriting and DALL·E for generating images, so you can create a complete, custom landing page without ever leaving the editor. The AI assistant is available inside many SeedProd blocks, letting you generate text or rework existing copy with just a click. You can also instantly translate your page content into 50+ languages and fine-tune tone and style with over 30 options, from professional to playful. Plus, you can even use SeedProd to create an entire website from scratch. For details, see our guide on how to create a WordPress website with AI. How I use SeedProd’s AI features: I use SeedProd’s AI writing assistant when I’m building landing pages or product pages and need polished copy fast. Instead of starting from scratch, I can select a block, click “Generate AI Text,” and have a strong starting draft instantly. For visual content, I use the AI image generator to create custom illustrations or hero images that match the page’s theme. If I don’t like the first result, then I can create multiple variations until I find the perfect fit. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: SeedProd offers a free plan for its page builder. AI writing and image generation are available on premium plans as a paid add-on. Pricing starts at $39.50/year for the base builder, with AI features included in higher tiers. Best For: Image editing, quick social media graphics, and AI-powered visual content creation. Canva is already one of the easiest tools for creating designs, but its Magic Studio AI features take it to another level with AI-powered image editing and media generation. It’s perfect for marketers who need professional visuals without advanced design skills. From background removal to text-to-image, text-to-video generation, Canva’s AI tools save time while expanding creative possibilities. Canva’s Magic Studio is powered by a mix of its own AI technology and models from leading partners like Google. This allows it to offer powerful image and video generation tools right inside the Canva editor as an all-in-one design solution. How I use Canva Magic Studio: I use Canva for creating and editing blog images, social media graphics, and quick promotional materials. The Magic Eraser is a huge time-saver when I need to remove unwanted elements from a photo, and the Expand tool is perfect for adjusting aspect ratios. I often tweak AI-generated visuals with Canva’s design tools for a polished final product. In particular, I use it to edit images generated with ChatGPT or Gemini because those platforms don’t have the same image editing capabilities as Canva. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited AI features. The Pro plan starts at $4.58 /month and includes Magic Studio AI tools, brand kits, premium templates, and unlimited background removal. Best For: AI-powered video creation, editing, and special effects. Runway is one of the most innovative AI tools for marketers who need professional-quality video without a production crew. It offers text-to-video generation, background replacement, and advanced editing features, all inside a simple browser interface. I am not a video editor, but as part of a marketing team, I sometimes need quick videos. Runway is a great option for creating product promos, social media clips, and creative visuals that stand out in your campaigns. You can even start from an image or video clip and transform it entirely with AI. How I use Runway: I’ve used Runway to try out quick video clips and fun personal projects. I thoroughly tested Runway Aleph against Google’s Veo-3 (limited preview available in Gemini). Runway performed quite well and, in some areas, exceeded Veo. I also liked Runway’s ease-of-use, storyboard, and remix features. As someone with limited video editing experience, I found Runway to be much easier to use than Veo. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan available with limited exports and watermarks. Paid plans start at $12/month, offering higher-quality output, faster rendering, and commercial usage rights. Best For: Creating natural, human-like voiceovers for videos, podcasts, and marketing content. I discovered ElevenLabs when our WPBeginner YouTube team was trying it out for their videos and shorts. It is one of the most advanced AI voice generation platforms I’ve tested. Its voices sound remarkably realistic, with natural pacing, emotional nuance, and subtle inflections that make them almost indistinguishable from real human narrators. With support for over 70 languages (in the upcoming Eleven V3 model) and a library of 120+ pre-built voices, it’s a flexible tool for any marketer looking to add professional-quality audio to their content. You can also fine-tune voices with precision controls to match your brand tone or creative style. How I use ElevenLabs: I first used ElevenLabs for a quick AI video experiment. It was a fun non-work project, but I was hooked. I am not a podcaster or video editor, and don’t have any professional audio equipment. ElevenLabs came as a blessing to easily add quick narrations to short videos. For example, I can paste a pre-written script for a video, choose a voice that fits the tone, then adjust stability and style sliders for a polished delivery. I then use Audacity to edit audio for my videos to add pauses and music. I’ve also used its multi-language support to quickly generate audio for a personal project. The new Eleven V3 model surprised me. It was able to distinguish Urdu from Hindi (two almost identical South Asian languages), and the pronunciation was surprisingly good. Key Features & Where It Excels: Practical Tips for Marketers: Free plan includes 10,000 characters/month. Paid plans start at $5/month with higher character limits, faster generation, and access to voice cloning. For daily content creation, the $22/month plan is the most practical choice. AI moves fast. New features arrive every month, and “best” depends on your workflow, budget, and goals. Use these quick checks to pick tools that fit how you work today while staying flexible for tomorrow. I have shared the tools that I use daily and are part of my workflows as a content marketer. Here are some more tools that I use quite frequently. The following are some of the most common questions that I hear from WPBeginner users on Reddit and LinkedIn. Which AI tool is best for beginners? If you’re starting out, I recommend ChatGPT. It’s versatile, easy to learn, and has a free plan so you can practice without spending money. Do I need to pay for AI tools to get good results? Not always. Many AI tools, like ChatGPT and Canva, have free tiers that work well for smaller projects. Paid plans usually offer faster responses, higher quality outputs, and more advanced features. Can AI tools replace human writers and designers? AI tools are great for speeding up tasks and sparking ideas, but they can’t fully replace human creativity and judgment. I still review and edit everything to make sure it fits my style and is factually correct. How do I know if an AI tool is right for me? Check if the tool solves a problem you face often, offers a free trial, and integrates with your existing workflow. If it saves you time or improves quality without adding complexity, then it’s worth keeping. Will AI tools keep getting better? Yes. The AI industry is evolving fast. Expect new features, better accuracy, and more integrations over the next few years. That’s why I suggest testing tools regularly to see if better options appear. These AI tools help me plan, write, design, and publish faster while keeping quality high. You can start with the free plans, test on one real task, and keep the tools that save you time without adding extra steps. Just make sure to keep human editing and fact-checking in the loop so your content stays accurate and on brand.

Title: The Stock Market Is In A Bubble, When Will It Burst?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2025/08/22/the-stock-market-is-in-a-bubble-when-will-it-burst/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T09:58:49Z
Full Content:
ByMike O'Sullivan, Senior Contributor. I’ve spent a bit of the summer re-reading the work of Charles Kindleberger, an important economist whose career intersected monetary systems and stock market bubbles, two issues that are top of mind for investors and economists today (see last week’s note ‘Stable Genius’). Kindleberger had an interesting career. His PhD advisor at Columbia was Henry Parker Willis (a key architect of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and the first Secretary of the Federal Reserve Board that became what we now know as the ‘Fed’). Then in one of his first jobs at the US Treasury, Kindleberger worked for Harry Dexter White, the interlocutor and ‘rival’ of JM Keynes at the Breton Woods conference. To that end, Kindleberger had a very strong sense of the creation of the monetary infrastructure that has built today’s economic world, and he then had the opportunity to play a role in this as one of the architects of the Marshall Plan, which did so much to spur growth in post-war Europe and to cement the view of the USA as the benevolent world power. Benn Steil’s book ‘The Marshall Plan: The Dawn of the Cold War’ is worth a read. Beyond his policy work, Kindleberger is best known for ‘Mania’s, Panics and Crashes’, the best outline of how asset bubbles form and are followed by crashes. It is highly pertinent today because a variety of stock market valuation indicators (the long-term ‘Shiller Price Earnings ratio’, the ‘Buffet Indicator’ as well as measures of market concentration – the largest ten stocks account for 75% of the entire market), point to the kind of market behaviour seen only in market bubbles (like 2001). Consistent with this, various investors, as well as entrepreneurs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman are warning of a ‘bubble’. One test of the bubble thesis is to follow Kindleberger’s theory that asset price bubbles follow a common speculative cycle. According to Kindleberger, bubbles often start with an innovation – in a technology (i.e. railways) or a financial policy or market structure, or even a growth ‘miracle’ (note all the Tiger economies from Hong Kong to Ireland have seen boom/bust cycles) towards which investors channel capital, and then even more as asset prices rise and a narrative around the ‘mania’ begins to build. This effect helps to loosen the strings of the overall economy and financial sector, but around this point asset prices are reaching incredulous levels as investor euphoria intensifies, drawing in further speculation, until prices then turn down, and the house of cards collapses in a crash. The collapse is always greater when households, institutions and individuals have borrowed on the back of high asset prices, and logically there is greater contagion across the economy. One lesson from the Kindleberger book is that ‘new’ things – inventions or economic policy liberalizations often provide the spark for a new speculative bubble, that can grow and destabilise a financial system if enough speculative capital is driven towards it. AI is a case in point. For context, Morgan Stanley estimates that over USD 3 trillion will be invested in AI related infrastructure (data centres, energy), with about half of that coming from the cashflow of the large technology companies, and the rest from private credit. It is clear that the large technology firms (from Microsoft to Nvidia) are the driving force behind this boom, especially so in the context of the fiscal weakness of most Western governments. The recent results season was instructive in this respect. Often in a bubble, the dot.com one being a good example, the earnings associated with the bubble are only ‘prospective’ or somehow inflated. This is not the case with the large technology firms so far – by and large they report very strong earnings, which helps to soften the bubble argument. The catch is the circularity of the capital expenditure by the large technology firms – META for example is spending aggressively on data centres and chips and running down its cash levels. To that extent, the large tech firms are making a bold bet to get ahead in the AI game, but it is a concentrated and possibly existential bet. If the strong cashflow position of the firms at the centre of this bubble is unusual in the context of the Kindleberger framework, two other factors also stand out as untypical. The first is that short- and long-term interest rates in the major economies are close to ‘neutral’, neither too hot not too cold. Bubbles are often characterised, or preceded by ‘easy money’, though it has to be recognised that the last decade has been one of near continual stimulus (from QE to fiscal spending). The other unusual factor is that the stock bubble is occurring against a backdrop of intense geopolitical and economic policy uncertainty – from great power competition to an unravelling trade order to a reconfiguring of America’s role in the world. The one way in which these dislocations fit the bubble narrative is that AI is a strategic asset, a ‘must-have’, that leads to an environment where for example the US government aims to take a strategic stake in Intel. Having written in early 2024 of a ‘Bubble Brewing’, I think we are now ‘in’ an AI centric market bubble, though not at the end of it in the sense of there being a ‘mania’ proper. In the short term, we might well see a wobble in AI stocks, before they pick up again. In a future note I will detail my own experiences of the dot.com and European real estate bubbles, which lead me to think that ‘we are not there yet’ in terms of the evolution of this bubble. It will end with the absurd – Nvidia encroaching on a USD 10 trn valuation, food companies publicly adopting AI and seeing their values double, wild predictions that AI can treble productivity and wipe out the debt, and on the flip side, the structural risks to energy and jobs markets that AI could pose. But, we are not there yet. Have a great week ahead, Mike

Title: History shows colossal capex from AI giants like Amazon and Meta could lead to underperformance in their stock

AI hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have invested billions in developing the technology and plan to spend even more — but history has a warning for their stock price. Tech giants are locked in an AI arms race, but their spending spree has potentially negative implications for their stock, a recent analysis from Morningstar shows. Data from the last 60 years shows stocks in the top 20% in capital expenditure relative to current sales have subsequently underformed relative to every other capex quintile. Philip Straehl, chief investment officer at Morningstar Wealth, told Business Insider this week that this is likely because the spending makes the technology more widely available, increasing competition for the big spenders. Higher capex "generally increases supply," Straehl said. "It's more difficult to monetize on those investments." Spending has been in the hundreds of billions of dollars so far for the four Big Tech firms mentioned above, and they're expected to spend $364 billion on AI development in 2025 alone. Since 2024, spending has started to cut into the free cash flow of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. Investors seem to be shrugging this off for now, but Straehl said the huge amounts of spending should start to matter down the line. "The core businesses of these companies are still doing well," he said. "But I think what's going to matter in the future is the ability to monetize generative AI." Bob Doll, the chief investment officer at Crossmarket Global Investments, told Business Insider that he agrees with Straehl's analysis. With the market highly valued amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, he's emphasizing the free cash flow factor in his portfolio. "Companies that substantially increase their capex usually lag for a while, until the capex is spent and you can start to see what's the return on that capex," Doll said. "So I share that concern." In terms of how Straehl is approaching this market, he said he's taking playing it safe with investor sentiment and market valuations historically high. "A core tenet of our investment philosophy is that the price paid for a given cash flow should be the primary driver of investment decisions," Straehl wrote in the August 19 analysis, adding: "We are once again reducing risk and are content to remain on the sidelines, awaiting more attractive opportunities."

Title: Futures Slide For Fifth Day As Jackson Hole Jitters Rise

by Tyler Durden | Aug 21, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. US equity futures dropped, extending the recent selloff into its fifth day, as traders stayed guarded ahead of the Federal Reserve’s gathering at Jackson Hole. As of 8:00 am, S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were flat after a two-day selloff that erased 2% off the index. In premarket trading, Nvidia rose 0.8% while most Magnificent Seven peers posted losses. Retail giant Walmart brought Q2 earnings season to an unofficial close after reporting an EPS miss (68c vs exp. 74c) and even though it lifted guidance (now expects net sales to rise 3.75% to 4.75% this year, versus previous forecast of a 3% to 4%) that wasn’t enough for the market, however, and the stock dropped in premarket trading. European stocks dropped 0.3%, erasing an earlier gain, and snapping a three-day winning streak. US treasuries fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year higher to 4.31%. The dollar strengthened and reversed all of yesterday’s losses while Brent crude rose to the highest in two weeks, even as the rest of the commodity complex was mixed. It’s a busy economic calendar: we get weekly jobless claims and August Philadelphia Fed business outlook (8:30am), S&P Global US PMIs (9:45 am), and July leading index and existing home sales (10 am). The Fed speaker slate includes Atlanta Fed President Bostic at 7:30 am, the last central bank official slated to speak before Chair Powell’s discourse at Jackson Hole Friday In premarket trading, Mag 7 stocks are mostly lower (Nvidia +0.8%, Tesla unchanged, Microsoft -0.1%, Alphabet -0.2%, Amazon -0.3%, Meta -0.3%, Apple -0.5%). Here are some other notable premarket movers: In corporate news, FanDuel, the online gambling division of Flutter Entertainment, is teaming up with CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange, to offer bets on stocks, commodity prices and even inflation. Google introduced a new slate of consumer gadgets, including several smartphones, a watch and new wireless earbuds, all meant to show off the company’s latest advances in artificial intelligence. Musk‘s Starlink service is said to be in conversation with Emirates and other Middle Eastern airlines, with winning business in the region potentially marking a watershed moment in Starlink’s global competition. This week has seen pressure on momentum names (read tech stocks) particularly the largest names, amid worries that their sharp rally since April has moved too far, too fast. Traders are also cautious as the Jackson Hole symposium kicks off later today, with investors awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at 10am ET Friday for guidance on the path for interest rates. Despite the pullback in stocks this week, the VIX hasn’t really budged, and Goldman said it’s time to buy the dip in momentum stocks (and the overall market according to JPMorgan). The market’s direction today will also be shaped by PMIs, home sales data and Walmart earnings (which missed but boosted its revenue forecast). For the euro area, the Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index compiled by S&P Global grew at the quickest pace in 15 months as manufacturing exited a three-year downturn. “What we are currently seeing is profit-taking and a natural flight to quality ahead of Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole,” said John Plassard, head of investment strategy at Cité Gestion. But “let’s not beat around the bush: this is not the end of tech, and even less so for stocks linked to artificial intelligence.” Swaps are currently pricing in 80% chance of a Fed quarter-point cut in September, and at least three more over the next year, some strategists warned that the market may be too optimistic about the pace and depth of easing. “All it’s going to take is a bit of stickiness in inflation and actually a labor market print which shows it’s not falling off a cliff for the market to say, ‘hang on,’” Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV. In his latest effort to stack the Fed board, Trump and his allies are demanding Fed Governor Lisa Cook resign over alleged owner-occupancy fraud. For her part, Cook signaled her intention to remain at the central bank. Yesterday, the latest FOMC Minutes for the July 29-30 meeting showed most officials viewed inflation risks as outweighing labor-market concerns, with tariffs fueling a growing divide within the rate-setting committee, though the discussions came before subsequent dramatic dire revisions to jobs data. On the geopolitical front, US Vice President JD Vance said negotiations over ending Russia’s war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control — including Ukrainian territory that Russia isn’t occupying — as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two nations. Brent crude rose 0.8%. The Stoxx 600 falls 0.2% with media, consumer product and chemical shares leading declines. Nordics represented several of the region’s biggest movers, with hearing-aid maker GN Store Nord surging 19% after reporting earnings, while Norwegian oil firm Aker BP jumped after a large oil find in the North Sea. UK retailer WH Smith plunged after signaling North American profit will be much weaker than previously hoped. Here are the biggest movers Thursday: Earlier in the session, Asian stocks traded in a tight range, as a rebound in some tech stocks was offset by declines in Japan. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2%, with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo among the top drags after a series of block trades at a discount. Hon Hai and TSMC were among the biggest boosts for the gauge. Shares hit a record high in Australia, while those in South Korea and Taiwan also advanced. Investors are awaiting cues from the Jackson Hole symposium, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak on Friday. Nvidia’s results next week will be another key test, with expectations for improving global tech earnings having bolstered sentiment. Equities also traded higher in mainland China, Vietnam and New Zealand on Thursday. MSCI equity gauges for every nation in the region are trading above their 200-day moving averages for the first time since 2021, according to Sentimentrader.com. In FX, the euro and pound both edge higher against the greenback after the better-than-expected PMI data. The Norwegian krone is the best-performing G-10 currency, rising 0.5% after Norway’s GDP grew more than forecast in the second quarter. In rates, treasuries are under pressure in early US trading amid steeper losses for most European bond markets sparked by stronger-than-anticipated August preliminary PMI gauges. US yields are higher by 1bp-2bp, the 10-year by about 1.8bp at 4.31%, vs increases of 3bp-4bp for UK and most euro-zone counterparts. US session features 30-year TIPS reopening auction at 1pm New York time. Week’s major focal point is Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday. UK gilts are leading declines in European government bonds after the UK private sector expanded at the strongest pace in 12 months. UK 10-year yields rise 3 bps to 4.70%. German 10-year borrowing costs add 2 bps to 2.73% after the euro area’s private sector grew at the quickest pace in 15 months. Looking at today’s calendar, US economic data calendar includes weekly jobless claims and August Philadelphia Fed business outlook (8:30am), August preliminary S&P Global US PMIs (9:45am) and July leading index and existing home sales (10am). Fed speaker slate includes Atlanta Fed President Bostic at 7:30am, the last central bank official slated to speak before Chair Powell’s discourse at Jackson Hole Friday Market Snapshot Top Overnight News Trade/Tariffs A more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk APAC stocks traded mixed, albeit with a mildly positive bias as the region attempted to shrug off the lacklustre lead from Wall St, where sentiment was dampened amid continued tech weakness and hawkish-leaning FOMC Minutes. ASX 200 outperformed amid a slew of earnings releases and breached the 9,000 level for the first time in history. Nikkei 225 was dragged lower by weakness in pharmaceuticals and automakers, with the latter not helped by reports that Japanese automakers are passing some of the expense of US tariffs through to American car buyers, which is a change from their strategy of absorbing the impact. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp were mixed with the Hong Kong benchmark led lower by underperformance in tech stocks including Baidu and Xiaomi, despite both recently reporting a jump in profits, while the mainland remained propped up following the PBoC’s liquidity efforts. Top Asian News European bourses (STOXX 600 -0.2%) are trading with little in the way of a clear bias. Geopolitical tensions resurfaced early doors after Ukraine’s Air Force stated that Russia used 574 drones and 40 missiles in an overnight attack. Focus also on EZ PMIs which saw the saw the composite move further into expansionary territory. European equity sectors show a mostly negative tilt with stock-specific updates relatively light. Energy names sit at the top of the leaderboard amid upside in underlying crude prices. To the downside, Media names lag with Wolters Kluwer (-2.2%) a notable underperformer in the sector following a PT reduction at Morgan Stanley. Top European News FX Fixed Income Commodities Geopolitics: Middle East Geopolitics: UKRAINE Geopolitics: Other US Event Calendar DB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap While the headline market moves were fairly muted over the past 24 hours, investors had to navigate a couple of major narratives. One was renewed concerns over Fed independence as President Trump suggested that Fed Governor Cook should resign, which pushed gold (+0.98%) to its best day since the weak July payrolls report on August 1. The other was continued pressure on tech stocks as the Mag-7 (-1.11%) posted consecutive declines of more than 1% for the first time since the post-Liberation Day sell-off in early April. This sent the S&P 500 (-0.24%) lower for a fourth session running even as the index recovered most of its -1% intra-day decline. The topic of the US administration’s influence over the Fed came back into the headlines as Trump posted that Fed Governor “Cook must resign, now!!!”. His post followed news that Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte had written a criminal investigation referral letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Governor Lisa Cook may have committed mortgage fraud. Pulte has been one of the staunchest Fed critics within the administration, earlier calling for an investigation into Chair Powell over the Fed’s building renovations. Yesterday Pulte claimed that the allegations give Trump “cause to fire” Governor Cook. Later in the day, Cook said in a statement that she had “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position”. Governor Cook was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by Joe Biden in 2022 and our US economists see her as leaning slightly towards to dovish end within the FOMC. Were Governor Cook to resign or be fired, that would create another opening for Trump to fill on the seven-person Board. With Stephen Miran nominated to take the seat recently vacated by Governor Kugler and two Fed Governors – Bowman and Waller – dissenting to vote for a rate cut at the July meeting, this would increase the prospects of a dovish majority emerging on the Board, especially if Chair Powell relinquishes his seat next year. That said, if concerns over threats to Fed independence increase, Powell could choose to serve out the rest of his board term (which ends in 2028) even after his term as Chair ends next May. The news was a reminder of the lingering concerns over future Fed independence and risks of fiscal dominance, though the extent of the market reaction was fairly modest. The most sustained reaction was in gold (+0.98%) as mentioned at the top. The dollar index fell by a couple of tenths following the news but was back to little changed (-0.05%) by the close. Front-end yields fell by 3-4bps, but that move came amid a broader risk-off mood early in the session and also reversed later on. By the close, 10yr Treasury yields were -1.5bps lower at 4.29% but 2yr yields were unchanged at 3.75%. This curve flattening was also supported by hawkish-leaning minutes of the July FOMC meeting. These showed that most of the FOMC “judged the upside risk to inflation” as greater than the “downside risk to employment”, with several participants noting the “risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored”. That said, the minutes did suggest easing would be warranted “if labor market conditions were to weaken materially”, and given the weak jobs report that followed the July decision, the relative focus on employment versus inflation risks will likely have shifted since. So, while pricing of September rate cut inched down yesterday to its lowest since the August 1 jobs report, a 25bp cut was still 83% priced. US equities saw an even larger round trip, with a rout for tech stocks early in session leaving the S&P 500 more than -1% down intra-day but recovering to -0.24% by the close. The NASDAQ fell -0.67%, having been almost -2% down early on, while the Mag-7 slid by -1.11% after a -1.67% drop on Tuesday. The last time the Mag-7 saw consecutive declines of more than 1% was during the post-Liberation Day collapse in early April. The tech sell-off may have been exacerbated by reporting of an MIT study claiming that 95% of enterprises adopting AI saw no measurable increase in profits. Here at DB research, we remain optimistic on the productivity impact of AI but the report is a reminder that successful integration of new technologies takes time and that it’s still uncertain who will be the biggest end beneficiaries of the AI wave. Outside of tech, US equities had a decent day, with most of the S&P 500 sectors advancing, led by energy (+0.86%) which benefited as Brent crude prices rose +1.60% to $66.84/bbl. Turning to Europe, we saw the latest rate decision from Sweden’s Riksbank, which kept rates on hold at 2.00% as expected while continuing to signal “some probability of a further interest rate cut this year”. Market pricing of another rate cut by year-end inched down to 88% from 91% the day before. We also heard from ECB President Lagarde, who said that “Recent trade deals have alleviated, but certainly not eliminated, global uncertainty” and noted that the euro area economy was likely to see slower growth this quarter. So that was arguably a bit more dovish in tone than her press conference last month, though Lagarde gave away little on the policy outlook. Expectations of ECB easing ticked up on the day, with 21bps of cuts now priced by next June, the highest this has been in almost two weeks. In turn, European government bonds rallied with 10yr bund yields falling -3.2bps to 2.72%, and OAT (-2.2bps) and BTP (-3.0bps) yields similarly moving lower. Bunds were also supported by Germany’s PPI inflation print (-1.5% yoy vs -1.4% expected), falling to a 13-month low in July. Meanwhile, the euro area final headline CPI for July came in line with the flash reading at 2.0%. Over in the UK, gilt yields saw a larger rally, with 10yr yields down -6.8bps to 4.67%. This came despite July CPI coming in slightly stronger than expected at +3.8% yoy for both headline and core inflation (vs +3.7% expected), which marked the highest headline reading since January 2024. A saving grace noted by our UK economist, Sanjay Raja, is that with the volatile transport and travel services components driving the upside, most core services metrics ticked down on the month (see Sanjay’s reaction here). Money markets moved to price in more BoE easing for early 2026 following the release, with the amount of cuts priced by next June rising +5.5bps to 38bps. The repricing in UK rates helped the FTSE 100 outperform (+1.01%). The Stoxx 600 rose +0.24% but continental indices were more subdued, with the CAC (+0.06%) posting a marginal gain but the DAX (-0.69%) and FTSE MIB (-0.36%) losing ground. Overnight, sentiment has turned risk-on again in most Asian equity markets. The KOSPI is up +0.73%, while the S&P/ASX 200 (+0.90%) is leading the way after a strong flash PMI print. Australia’s composite PMI rose from 53.8 to 54.9, and the manufacturing index reached a 35-month high of 52.9. Chinese stocks are also on the rise, with the CSI (+0.72%) and the Shanghai Composite (+0.33%) higher, though the Hang Seng (-0.10%) is lagging. Meanwhile, US equity futures on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 are little changed after yesterday’s decline. The one Asian market defying the regional positive trend is Japan, with the Nikkei down -0.58%. That comes despite Japan’s composite PMI rising to a 6-month high of 51.9 in the August flash reading (up from 51.6 in July), as stabilization in manufacturing (49.9 vs 48.9 in July) has offset slowing services growth (52.7 vs 53.6 in July). However, long-end JGB yields are inching higher to new multi-decade highs ahead of the July inflation print tomorrow morning, with the 30-year yield up +0.7bps to 3.18%, a new all-time high since this tenor was introduced in 1999. To the day ahead, the main highlight will be the August flash PMI prints in Europe and the US. Other data releases include the August Philadelphia Fed business outlook, July existing home sales and weekly jobless claims in the US as well as August Eurozone consumer confidence. Earnings include Walmart, Intuit, and Workday. The Fed’s Bostic is due to speak, while the Kansas City Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium begins this evening with the main events on Friday and Saturday.

Title: The AI race is on. Google needs its engineers to keep up with the competition.

Good morning. I couldn't assemble flat-pack furniture if my life depended on it. Sometimes, it feels like it actually does. That's why I'm thrilled about this startup's mission: Make US manufacturing easier than following an Ikea manual. In today's big story, BI's Hugh Langley exclusively reports on Google ramping up the pressure on workers to use AI for everything — or risk falling behind. Googlers told Hugh how they feel about it. What's on deck: Markets: Infamous market bear Michael Burry appears to have flipped his stance on stocks. Tech: Hundreds of Microsoft employees are comparing compensation in a giant spreadsheet, BI exclusively reports. Business: Target's next CEO already has a plan to revive the retailer. But first, the competition is fierce. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. For Googlers, the message is clear: use AI to make yourself more productive — or get left behind. Some are excited about it, others are doing it grudgingly, one Google engineer told Hugh. Either way, their boss needs them to do it. Google is under pressure. In an all-hands meeting last month, CEO Sundar Pichai said that as rival companies leverage AI, Google needs to rise to the challenge if it wants to compete, employees who heard the remarks told BI. He's not wrong about the competition. Microsoft told workers in June that "using AI is no longer optional." In a frank blog post, GitHub's CEO said developers have a choice: embrace AI, or "get out of your career." The rivals are becoming lean, mean, and increasingly machine. These directives apply as much to the companies as to their workers. If they fall behind their competitors — as a worker may fall behind a colleague — they risk never catching up. The future of the software engineering profession will be a tale of the haves and have-nots. That's according to Meta's chief technology officer. "The engineers who master the tools to the point that they can't themselves be replaced by the tools command a premium," he said on Monday. Google seems to know this — and it's watching its engineers closely. Pichai said in June that engineers' weekly productivity hours are up 10% thanks to AI. Some companies are tracking employee AI use on a more granular level. Three providers of worker-tracking software told BI they've seen a sharp rise in demand over the past two years. Companies want their workers to use AI, and they aren't taking risks. It can be an unpleasant message to hear. Few people enjoy receiving instructions that come with stark warnings. That said, the Google employees who spoke with BI seem on board. "It seems like a no-brainer that you need to be using it to get ahead," one engineer told Hugh. In Google's internal message board, BI found more skeptical remarks: "You know a technology works and is great when you're forced to praise it to maintain your livelihood." In this race, it seems there is no medal for second place. In the end, there may only be the companies that kept up, and the ones that didn't. 1. JPMorgan's new HQ blurs the lines between work and life. The bank's new Midtown Manhattan office is filled with a luxury gym, a massive food hall, a 24/7 grab-and-go option, and more. Headhunters, consultants, and management experts told BI those wrap-around perks reinforce Wall Street's work-as-life culture, though. 2. Don't lose faith in major tech stocks. This week's sell-off is likely driven by anticipation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, wealth manager Jeremy Hartle told BI. UBS said it's still confident in the sector despite the selling. 3. The "Big Short" investor seems to have done a 180. Michael Burry, one of the market's most famous bears, appears to have overhauled his stock portfolio, according to an update from his firm last week. He's swapping bearish puts for bullish calls, and is betting on ailing companies like Lululemon to execute a turnaround, portfolio gurus told BI. 1. How much Microsoft employees say they make. It's review season at the software giant, and employees are comparing notes on compensation in a large spreadsheet, BI's Ashley Stewart exclusively reports. With 850 entries and counting, here's what employees across cloud, AI, and other teams have said they earn in salary, stock, and bonuses. 2. Inside Meta's massive AI restructuring. Alexandr Wang, the leader of Meta Superintelligence Labs, announced the biggest reorganization of the company's AI operations in a memo sent to employees. Most team leaders will report to Wang, and the company will dissolve yet another major AI unit. 3. It's not just AI talent: Google is paying the big bucks for celebs. Google flexed its marketing might with a star-studded Pixel event, featuring cameos from "Call Her Daddy" podcaster Alex Cooper, NBA star Steph Curry, and more. The tech giant also announced a new partnership with Curry, who will serve as its "Performance Advisor" across its various products. 1. Sin City's sluggish summer. Las Vegas is in the middle of a vibe shift. Since gambling has expanded to other cities and consumers are starting to expect more high-end experiences, Vegas is losing some of its appeal to the more budget-conscious thrill-seekers. But it's not dead yet. 2. Target's new CEO has a plan to get the retailer back on track. In its earnings call, Target announced COO Michael Fiddelke will take over as CEO in February. Fiddelke, who spent the past quarter leading a new acceleration effort, laid out a three-part plan that he said is based on "knowing what makes Target Target." 3. TJX's secret weapon to keep prices low. As other retailers have started passing tariff costs onto consumers, the company behind T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods has been able to soften the blow and keep sales and profits strong. Its CEO credited TJX's price negotiation strategy and how well its buying and allocation teams work in tandem. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore.

Title: Palantir stock plummets 9% as AI sector faces broad decline

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Palantir shares plunged more than 9% on Tuesday, extending the company’s losing streak to five consecutive trading days. The decline comes amid a broader slide in AI stocks, with industry leaders like NVIDIA and Meta also experiencing significant drops in their stock values. The downturn has erased much of Palantir’s strong gains from earlier in the month, following its latest earnings report where it topped Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Since August 13, the company’s total decline has reached 15.5%. Palantir’s stock slump has been partly attributed to a critical report from Citron Research, which alleges the company’s stock is overvalued. The report suggests that if OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation metrics were applied to Palantir, the company’s shares would trade at $40, significantly lower than its current trading price. NVIDIA shares also took a hit, slipping by as much as 3% before market close, while Meta’s stock fell nearly 2% to $753.43 per share on Tuesday afternoon. This adds to a 3% drop in Meta’s share price on Monday. Overall, the Nasdaq experienced a 1.4% decline in midday trading. The decline in AI stocks isn’t an isolated event. Cryptocurrency stocks also tumbled on Tuesday, with Coinbase shares falling nearly 5%, Robinhood dropping more than 5%, and Bitcoin sliding 2.4%. Despite the recent downturn, Palantir reported robust earnings, with quarterly revenue surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, commented on the state of the AI sector last week, saying, “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” adding, “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Despite recent struggles, 2025 has been a highly successful year for Palantir’s stock, which has surged 110% since the beginning of the year, starting at $75.19. The rise has been fueled by the company’s advancements in AI tools, which were pivotal in securing a $10 billion deal with the Army to consolidate 75 contracts. Palantir’s outlook remains optimistic; the company boosted its full-year revenue guidance, expecting earnings between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion, up from its previous estimates of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. The company’s success aligns with the U.S. government’s push for greater AI and chip infrastructure, involving financial commitments from companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI. While Palantir and other AI stocks face short-term challenges, the sector’s long-term prospects remain strong, driven by continued technological advancements and strategic government support.

Title: Interested In YieldMax ETFs? Here Are The 5 Best ETFs To Check Out
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/yieldmax-etfs-5-best-ones-to-check-out/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T11:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions. AMZY allows investors to participate in these growth trends while receiving substantial monthly distributions, creating a compelling combination for those seeking both income and growth potential from a single investment. FBY focuses on Meta Platforms (META), delivering strong 2025 performance with a 16.1% year-to-date return alongside a 34.06% forward yield. Meta's transformation from a social media company to a "metaverse" and artificial intelligence leader has created significant stock volatility, particularly around quarterly earnings and major product announcements. This volatility provides excellent raw material for FBY's covered call strategy. Meta's substantial investments in virtual reality, augmented reality and AI infrastructure create ongoing uncertainty about future profitability timelines, leading to stock price fluctuations that benefit option strategies. The company's core advertising business remains highly profitable, providing fundamental support while newer initiatives drive volatility. FBY's $177 million in assets indicates solid investor interest in monetizing Meta's transformation story. The fund offers exposure to next-generation computing platforms while generating meaningful monthly income from one of technology's most ambitious companies. Meta's position in social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence ensures continued relevance in the global technology landscape. FBY presents an opportunity to participate in the potential metaverse revolution while collecting substantial distributions during the uncertain transition period. Bottom Line YieldMax ETFs offer income investors a unique approach to generating monthly distributions from growth stocks that traditionally don't pay dividends. The five funds highlighted—CONY, TSLY, NFLY, AMZY, and FBY—represent the most established and liquid options in this specialized category, each offering different risk-reward profiles through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies. While these funds can generate impressive yields ranging from 30% to over 120%, investors must understand that high income comes with trade-offs, including capped upside participation and significant volatility risk. For income-focused investors comfortable with these dynamics, YieldMax ETFs provide an innovative way to harvest yield from some of the market's most dynamic companies.

Title: How Target let Walmart steal its rizz

Time Published: 2025-08-21T08:55:02Z

Phil Wahba is a senior writer at Fortune primarily focused on leadership coverage, with a prior focus on retail. Good morning. When Brian Cornell took the reins at Target 11 years ago, the retailer was, to put it mildly, a mess. Among its many problems: Target was struggling with out-of-stocks that frustrated shoppers, employee morale was low, and there was a sense that the retailer had lost much of the “Tar-zhay” cheap-chic magic that had won it millions of loyal, fanatical shoppers for decades. So it’s disappointing for fans to see that same shopping list of problems plaguing Target again. Sales have been in decline for three years now, and the stock has plunged 64% from its all-time high in 2022. It didn’t have to be this way. At the start of his tenure, Cornell, who the company announced yesterday will step down as CEO on February 1, was an outsider unafraid to move fast and break things. He had been CEO of a big PepsiCo unit, Michaels Stores, and Sam’s Club before that. As I detailed in a 2015 cover story, he quickly ended Target’s ill-advised Canada expansion to focus without distraction on a struggling U.S. business, assembled an A-team of merchants to re-energize Target’s store brands (for a while, Target was launching billion-dollar brands on a monthly basis) and changed Target’s insular culture. And in March 2017, in perhaps his boldest move, he announced a $7 billion multi-year program to remodel its physical stores, making them more inviting but also equipping them to support e-commerce pick up and delivery at a time investing in physical stores was seen as folly given Amazon’s ascendance. Wall Street pummeled the stock but Cornell had the last laugh. Target soared for years, building a huge digital business and taking market share from department stores. It was also well-positioned with its curbside pickup and improved grocery when the pandemic struck to be one of retail’s big winners alongside Walmart and Costco. Indeed, sales rose 20% in 2020 and the following year, revenue passed $100 billion for the first time. By that point, Cornell had been in the post for eight years, roughly the average tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO. But rather than hand on the baton, he signed on for another three years through 2025. Unfortunately, inertia set in. Shoppers felt Target lost its edge. Millions defected. Meanwhile, Walmart swooped in to take market share with its suddenly hipper apparel and home goods offerings. (The whole contretemps around DEI was also an unforced error that hurt morale.) Cornell had a great run overall, but like many CEOs, seems to have misjudged the moment when it’s time to move on. (And he’s not really going away—he will stay on as executive chairman indefinitely.) Though Wall Street had been hoping for an outsider to take the reins, Target’s COO Michael Fiddelke got the nod. He’ll have his work cut out for him. But perhaps the lesson here is, even successful CEOs have a shelf life.—Phil Wahba The Fed is more concerned about inflation than jobs U.S. Federal Reserve officials were more concerned about the inflationary impact of President Trump’s trade tariffs than signs of weakness in the job market, according to the minutes of their last meeting. The Fed meets at Jackson Hole today. Chair Jerome Powell will make a closely watched speech on Friday. Fed governor accused of mortgage fraud Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was accused of mortgage fraud and referred for criminal prosecution by federal housing regulator Bill Pulte. He said she "has falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statutes." Cook is accused of taking out loans on properties in Michigan and Atlanta and claiming that both were her principal residence. Trump called on her to resign. Context: The Trump administration is trying to end the Fed’s economic independence and bring it under political control. Powell has also been referred for a criminal probe, baselessly, over his remarks to Congress. Meta reorganizes its “superintelligence” unit Meta is doubling down on its so-called race to “superintelligence,” reshuffling its AI organization once more as its new Meta Superintelligence Labs group takes shape. But analysts say investors are keeping their eye on the prize Meta has always promised: improved products that increase engagement and, in turn, sell more ads. Superintelligent AI models, if they arrive, are just a means to that end. Former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang is leading the reorganization. China moved against Nvidia after “insulting” remarks from Lutnick Regulators in China moved to restrict companies from buying Nvidia chips after they felt insulted by remarks on CNBC by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the FT reports. “We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,” Lutnick said on July 15. “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking.” Bed Bath & Beyond blasts California Bed Bath & Beyond won’t open stores in California because the state “has created one of the most overregulated, expensive and risky environments for businesses in America,” executive chairman Marcus Lemonis said in a statement. The chain went bankrupt in 2023 and closed all its stores, but is attempting a comeback under Kirkland’s Inc. It has opened a new store in Nashville. California officials were unfazed by Lemonis’s criticism. “Like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath & Beyond no longer existed,” the governor’s spokesperson said. The tide shifts in the labor market Managers offered up significant raises to keep employees around during the Great Resignation in the aftermath of the pandemic. Now they’re taking the power back with return-to-office policies and pay cuts. ‘Bubble’ worries hit Big Tech stocks Big Tech stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid concerns of a potential AI bubble after a new MIT report found that nearly 95% of corporate generative AI pilot programs had “little to no” profit or revenue upside. Experts who spoke to Fortune, however, say this correction is expected and not necessarily indicative of a bubble. Sony raises console prices due to tariffs Sony announced that it will raise the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles to adjust for the Trump Administration's tariffs on electronics made in China. The company joins Microsoft and Nintendo, which have made similar price increases on their consoles this year. We’re not going to see those Epstein docs A federal court has ruled for a second time that transcripts and exhibits from the grand jury probe of Jeffrey Epstein will not be released because there are not "any special circumstances" to justify the move. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket, after the index closed down 0.24% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.1% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.65%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.39%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 0.37%. India’s Nifty 50 was up 0.29% before the end of the session. Bitcoin fell to $113.8K.
