Title: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for Apple — one that could shape CEO Tim Cook's legacy

Tim Cook has built a reputation as a steady stalwart of Apple during his nearly 15-year tenure as CEO. His next — and potentially final — chapter at the tech giant could be his most defining yet. This year is shaping up to be a big one for Apple and the 65-year-old CEO, whose eventual retirement is a topic of much speculation in the tech industry. His company is planning a long-delayed update to its virtual assistant, Siri, to solidify its standing in artificial intelligence, and tech analysts expect the next major iPhone innovation to be a highly anticipated foldable model. Cook took over for Apple's late founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Since then, he has led the company through innovative product launches, turbulent times, and financial highs. Under Cook's leadership, Apple has woven together an ecosystem of interconnected products and services that shaped how consumers interact with the company. The iPhone may be its cash cow, but its services business — which Cook expanded to include AppleTV, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music — and smart accessories like the Apple Watch help keep the company relevant. "Tim Cook's greatest accomplishments are the financial evolution of the company, the integration of Apple silicon, and maintaining the iPhone's dominant walled garden ecosystem," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told Business Insider. Still, Cook's greatest challenges may lie ahead as he navigates political changes, greater competition from tech rivals, and an AI arms race that could leave Apple behind. After a turbulent 2025, Cook is navigating the aftershocks of major changes to US policies, Apple's supply chain, and the global smartphone market landscape. The year 2025 was marked by a new high for Apple's stock as the company reached a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time in October. However, it also faced economic headwinds in the form of tariffs and stiff competition abroad. China remains a challenge for Apple, with revenue in the region down 4% in its most recent quarter, though Cook said on the October earnings call that he expects the new iPhone 17 lineup to drive a return to growth in the region. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei are gaining popularity with local smartphone users. A major America-first shift in trade policy under President Donald Trump also prompted Apple to rethink its supply chain. It rapidly shifted some iPhones to India last year and pledged to invest hundreds of billions more in the US in the coming years. Still, China remains a significant manufacturing hub for Apple, and the US-China trade war could continue to impact the company. "So far, Cook has walked that political tightrope with considerable dexterity, but the high degree of economic policy uncertainty and volatility will require him to continue steering the ship with an even hand," Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider. One of Cook's biggest challenges ahead will be cementing Apple's positioning in artificial intelligence, an area where the company appears to have fallen behind its rivals, analysts tell Business Insider. It's not just the launches of Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, that have to be successful. It's also about the way Cook is integrating the technology into Apple's operations. "AI has redefined what legacy means," Martha Heller, CEO of Heller, a specialized technology executive search firm, told Business Insider. Ten years ago, "the goal was to leave a solid foundation so the next leader could create change intentionally without chaos," she said. Now, it's up to leaders to create an AI road map — from the nitty-gritty of products to the mindset of the board — to take a company into the future. Cook has been praised for his steady leadership, but his strategy will have to be turned up a notch if he doesn't want to be caught flat-footed in the age of rapid change. Heller said Cook has made "partial progress" in his performance under the new AI-driven standards that CEOs must consider. "Cook has laid the foundation for Apple's AI future, but the next 12 to 18 months will determine whether reinvention becomes his defining legacy," Heller said. Of course, while competitors are investing billions into their AI ventures, Apple's more modest approach could pay off in the end, as investors closely scrutinize how much Big Tech companies are spending on AI and the return on investment. Apple's AI push has so far failed to fuel the iPhone upgrade super cycle that some analysts, like Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, predicted the iPhone 16 family would bring. The jury is still out on the iPhone 17's overall performance, but Cook said he expected the December quarter would be the "best" yet for iPhone sales. Like other tech companies, Apple also faces the challenge of holding onto its top talent to drive future innovation. In 2025, it lost several AI researchers who left to pursue opportunities at rival tech companies, such as Meta. The company is also coming up against device competition from its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who is teaming up with OpenAI to create an AI gadget. With an AI arms race in full swing and competitors releasing innovative takes on the smartphone, such as foldable models, the pressure is on Apple to act faster than it has recently. "While Cook has kept Apple's growth trajectory moving forward at a steady clip, he has not overseen a step-change innovation that resets Apple's competitive position for the next two decades, as Jobs did with the iPhone," Chatterjee said. The Vision Pro, released in February 2024, failed to gain traction among the masses at a $3,500 price point and lacked a killer app to differentiate it from other headsets. The long-rumored Apple Car, which held potential to be a tenure-defining product for Cook, is widely believed to be scrapped. However, Apple Watch and AirPods have become essential pieces of tech for many Apple users. In 2020, Apple's former CFO Luca Maestri likened the revenue of the wearables segment to that of a Fortune 140 business. But with innovations to the iPhone feeling increasingly incremental over the last decade, 2026 could be the year when Apple's much-needed reset finally arrives, as competitors continue to encroach on its competitive edge at the forefront of innovation. A new and improved Siri is expected to arrive this year, following a few delays. Although Apple hasn't confirmed, supply chain analysts and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have predicted a foldable iPhone could come as early as this fall. If so, it would be in line with Apple's "not first, but best" strategy of not being the first to market a product but to try to do it better than its competitors. Cook hasn't publicly revealed his succession plan, but that hasn't stopped tech industry watchers from speculating on who will replace him and when. The Financial Times recently reported that Cook has intensified his search for a successor. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The year 2025 brought about meaningful leadership changes at Apple. John Giannandrea was the senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy at Apple before announcing his plans to retire in the spring of 2026. Cook's longtime No. 2, Jeff Williams, retired last year. Cook has said in the past that he prefers an internal successor and that he is grooming "several" executives as potential replacements. Bloomberg in October identified John Ternus, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, as "the most likely heir apparent." Whoever ends up stepping in for Cook will be closely examined for their technical background. Unlike Jobs, Cook is famously "not a product guy" — Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson as much. A candidate from a hardware background, like Ternus, could excite Apple's fan base — and investors. Finding his replacement will undoubtedly shape Cook's legacy at Apple. He's spent nearly 15 years building it, seeing the company through several wins and missteps. "Cook's legacy, upon his departure, will be defined by steady and disciplined operational stewardship — proof that a company can be more than just exciting and visionary; it can also be enormously valuable to all its stakeholders," Chatterjee said.

Title: How the stock market could sink Trump in 2026

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on As US operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets | Photo Credit: ANDREW KELLY In a recent campaign-style speech, US President Donald Trump asserted that “the only thing that’s really going up, big, it’s called the stock market, and your 401(k).” He has a point: all major US stock indices realised double-digit percentage gains last year. And yet, the November midterm elections are still a long way off. Were there to be a stock-market correction in the meantime, Trump’s economic point of pride could become a liability. Unfortunately for Trump, a market correction (a 10-20 per cent decline) does seem highly probable this year. There is an unusually high degree of optimism priced into the market, making stocks susceptible to a large pullback in the event of an economic setback — which any number of economic or political “known unknowns” could cause in the run-up to the midterms. Consider the current optimism. It would be an understatement to say that stocks are priced at lofty valuations; in fact, they are priced for economic perfection. As measured by the Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio, the S&P 500 is valued at more than twice its long-term average, and at close to its pre-2001 dot-com high. And as measured by the Buffett Indicator — the ratio of the total US stock-market valuation to US GDP — the market is trading at an all-time record, some 50 per cent above its 2008 high. Another measure of optimism is the current bullishness on the part of fund managers. According to Bank of America, these influential voices are more exuberant now than at any point in the past three years, and their current cash holdings have plummeted to their lowest level on record. Again, such sentiment — and the bets that follow from it — would seem to set the market up for a major pullback should the economy falter in the coming months. Why might that happen? One need only consider the country’s unsustainable public finances, coupled with the threat Trump poses to the US Federal Reserve’s independence, to envisage a return of the bond market vigilantes and a spike in long-term interest rates. Heightening this risk is the country’s high dependence on foreigners to finance its $2 trillion annual budget deficit. If foreigners come to think that the US government will try to inflate away its debt, they will demand higher interest payments on their US Treasury bond holdings, which would increase the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and many other common forms of borrowing. Another domestic risk is the AI bubble, which could burst or deflate at any time. This risk is especially acute considering that as much as half of US GDP growth is being driven by AI-related investment. Moreover, the end of the AI bubble would have a chilling effect on the stock prices of the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), whose combined valuation is around 35 per cent of the S&P 500’s total. Oracle, whose stock price already fell 30 per cent last quarter, could prove to be the canary in the coal mine. The US stock market could also be shaken by economic reversals abroad. One such shock could come from China, which is still relying excessively on an investment- and export-centric model to drive its economy. With China’s trade surplus now exceeding $1 trillion, increased US and European protectionism has become more likely, and with it, a further breakdown in the international trading system. Another shock could come from Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s pursuit of an irresponsible budget policy has raised fears of a “Liz Truss moment” that could send Japanese government bond yields sharply higher (as happened in the UK in the fall of 2022). Were that to occur, we could see a disruptive unwinding of the Japanese carry trade (borrowing at a lower interest rate in one country to invest in assets elsewhere) and the repatriation of Japanese capital that has been supporting US financial markets. Finally, as last weekend’s US military operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets. Even before Trump announced that the US plans to “run” Venezuela until a “proper” transition can take place, China was conducting live military drills in the Taiwan Strait, and Russia was dragging its feet on a peace settlement with Ukraine. China might try to capitalise on this moment to regain control over Taiwan, and Russia may be emboldened to make even more ambitious demands for territorial concessions from Ukraine. Even the smallest possibility of a conflict over Taiwan should be deeply concerning, considering that it supplies more than half the world’s semiconductors. If those who live by the sword die by the sword, the same may be true of equity prices in the run-up to this year’s midterm elections. By emphasising how well the stock market is doing now, Trump could be setting himself up for disappointment if any number of risks materialise.

January 06, 2026 07:00 ET | Source: BitMEX BitMEX VICTORIA, Seychelles, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BitMEX, one of the safest exchanges, today announced the launch of Equity Perps, a new derivatives product that allows traders to gain exposure to major U.S. stocks and equity indices using cryptocurrency as collateral. The launch expands BitMEX’s product suite beyond crypto-native markets, enabling 24/7 trading on traditional equity benchmarks, including when U.S. stock markets are closed. Equity Perps are cash-settled perpetual swap contracts that track the price of individual U.S. stocks or indices and do not have an expiry date. Similar to BitMEX’s existing crypto perpetuals, the contracts use a funding rate mechanism to anchor prices to the underlying reference index. Traders can take long or short positions with up to 20x leverage, using assets such as Bitcoin or Tether as margin collateral. “Equity Perps give traders a more flexible way to access U.S. equity markets using crypto,” said Stephan Lutz, CEO of BitMEX. “By removing traditional market hours and allowing crypto collateral, we are extending our derivatives expertise to a broader set of global markets while maintaining the reliability and performance BitMEX is known for.” At launch, Equity Perps are available on a selection of widely traded U.S. stocks and indices, including Amazon, Apple, Circle, Coinbase, Meta, Nvidia, Robinhood, Tesla, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. BitMEX plans to expand the range of available contracts over time. Trading is open 24/7, with index pricing during U.S. market hours based primarily on real-time equity prices and, outside those hours, supported by tokenized spot prices from multiple exchanges. All Equity Perps trades on BitMEX feature a maker rebate of 2.5 basis points and a taker fee of 7.5 basis points. Funding is exchanged every eight hours, consistent with BitMEX’s existing perpetual swap products, regardless of U.S. equity market hours. In the event of corporate actions such as stock splits, affected contracts will be settled early and relisted once the action is complete. To mark the launch, BitMEX is offering a 70,000 USDT prize pool for eligible users who trade Equity Perps, alongside maker rebates on all Equity Perps contracts. Additional educational resources and product guides are available through the BitMEX website and blog. About BitMEX BitMEX is the OG crypto derivatives exchange, providing professional crypto traders with a platform that caters to their needs with low latency, deep crypto native and especially BTC liquidity and unmatched reliability. Since its founding, no cryptocurrency has been lost through intrusion or hacking, allowing BitMEX users to trade with confidence that their funds are secure and that they have access to the products and tools required to be profitable.

Title: Is the AI Boom a Bubble Waiting to Pop? Here’s What History Says

As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst. The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history. The S&P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Read more: Bank of England Sees Rising Financial Risks From AI and Lending Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the circular nature of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants. Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different. “At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?” Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. Read more: No Firm Is Immune if AI Bubble Bursts, Google CEO Tells BBC “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles. Pace, Length One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett. By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gaining 130%. While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said. Concentration The S&P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who said in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks. Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said. Fundamentals Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins. “It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said. But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago. The potential for credit risk in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by Societe Generale. Valuations The S&P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, Cisco Systems Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today. Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said. Investor Scrutiny Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade. This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises. “I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.” Top photograph: A Samsung Electronics Co. sign with a slogan reading, “AI for All” at the IFA Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances trade fair in Berlin, Germany, on Thursday, Sept. 5, 2024; photo credit: Liesa Johannssen/Bloomberg Topics InsurTech Data Driven Artificial Intelligence

Title: Fav tech museums – Aresluna

Marcin Wichary 5 January 2026 / 4,400 words / 350 photos I love technology history because it brings me both advice and encouragement: stories of people solving problems despite constraints much bigger than mine, stories of flawed inventions and flawed inventors, stories of oddities that can inform and inspire. Sometimes the blueprints for the best version of the future already exist in the past, but only if you do some spelunking first, and remixing second. Those who read history will be able to repeat it, but under better circumstances, or more stellar execution. Technology history means visiting tech museums, and I have been doing that for decades now. I wanted to reflect on why I love some of them more than the others, so I made this photo essay: six best tech museums Iâve been to, 16 great onesâ¦ and, at the end, three not-as-positive examples. I wrote it mostly for myself to think about what museums mean for me, but perhaps you will find something in it, too. I liked more museums than presented here, of course. And I have a lot more to visit (please let me know if you have suggestions!). But of the ones I have been to, these are the ones that deserve a spotlight. Taiwan (the site near Songshan Park)Â /Â Visited in 2025 /Â nrm.gov.tw This place blew me away. Itâs a newish museum, but hosted in an old, massive railway workshop building complex, so you know the space itself is going to be part of the story â locomotives, huge industrial cranes that lift them around, various bits and pieces of preserved machinery. I generally love this kind of a vibe (even the smell of it all) and find it, in a way, breathtaking. Part of me would choose to live here in an instant. But, there are more things that make this museum special. The production value is impeccable and it seems to be spent on things that matter. For example, there are absolutely magnificent videos here of men restoring old locomotives, presented on big vertical displays. Theyâre transfixing, almost pornographic. But they still feel made by someone who cares about this stuff and wants to show it well, and not just show it off. The landmark exhibit here is a multimedia piece with a huge transparent screen occasionally moving by an important locomotive, showing its innards. Itâs a lavish, impressive animation, with huge thumping bass and 3D rendersâ¦ maybe a bit too cinematic, but again: it feels like itâs coming from the right place. Trains are amazing and underrated, and they deserve awe. Generally, thereâs a lot of pride around here, and it feels like the right flavor of pride. In many exhibits, one can sense how people care about restoring the old machines and telling their stories, how the railways mattered to Taiwan, how important this preservation of history as a concept is to people here. Flanking the big building with amazing sightlines are some smaller, more traditional exhibits. The focus seems to be a bit more on the cultural aspects of railways, and less on the tech side. I learned so much from it all. Overall, itâs a fantastic blend of old and new, with thoughtful details. Itâs big and inspiring enough I came back again a week later. There are many other disused buildings around the refurbished one that havenât been touched yet, and I understand the aspiration is to turn it into almost a park of sorts. I hope Iâll be back to check out how theyâre doing. Figueres, SpainÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â mte.cat This was perhaps my best museum experience ever â the right thing at the right time in an unexpected place and with unexpected intensity. This thread captured the story, and I reflected upon it later here. So yeah, Iâm biased, but the reasons for that bias are worth celebrating. This museum definitely belongs to the joint category of âgreat collectionâ + âgreat passion,â with so many typewriters you could sometimes even pause and trace the history of individual manufacturer, as all of their models are shown side by side like on a timeline. Thereâs also something I always appreciate: the ephemera. Itâs not just typewriters, but also the desks, the accessories, the advertisements, the complementary devices. There is a risk of a museum doing that kind of stuff in a way that feels like hoarding and I donât fully understand yet what separates one from the other. This museum is not an extreme time capsule like other museums can be, but I find the ephemera crucial to understanding the machines. Nothing, after all, is used in isolation, and no device can be removed from the context of its time and its surroundings. Iâm also very happy I got to briefly meet the creator of the museum (and his whole family) before his passing. MelbourneÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â acmi.net.au My photos wonât do ACMI justice. This is an extremely well-made museum, filled with great experiences and stories. Every exhibit here drips with creativity, from simple ideas like splitting a car in half with two well-placed mirrors, or miniatures of TV rooms held inside actual TVs. There are probably fifty great little details here that will make you happy even if you donât notice them, and are a proof that a museum is so much more than its collection. Even the applications of technology are wonderful and exemplary. This isnât a museum where youâd encounter a piece of paper saying âunder maintenanceâ slapped atop a stock Android tablet. For example, there is one exhibit here where you can edit a video by moving wooden blocks: Upon entry, you get a cool artifact resembling a View-Master reel where you âcollectâ interesting information by tapping on things; most museums would screw this up somehow, and here it works flawlessly and the interactions are delightful. It feels the way we want tech to be â serving and enhancing, integrated, reliable, in the background. You can tell the museum is run by a designer! This is all really creative and endlessly inspiring. Top of my list. My strict travel plans meant I only visited once, and I regret it, asÂ I feel I only scratched the surface. BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â computerspielemuseum.de This museum punches above its weight. Most videogame museums Iâve seen are vehicles for hollow nostalgia, arcades by a different name. But Berlinâs Computer Game Museum has more depth and tries to do the art and history of videogames justice. There is a little arcade here, for sure, even styled appropriately and with a cute list of highscores. There are also a few nicely recreated âteenagerâ rooms matching different decades. But there are also rare prototypes of local games (like the East Germanyâs Poly-Play), and some art pieces like PainStation, ROM CHECK FAIL, and the worldâs worst Pac-Man made even worse by attaching it to a comically oversized Atari joystick (shoes off!). The selection of games continues to be surprising elsewhere: Would you expect to see Stanley Parable here? Or ELIZA? The design of the place is also interesting. Thereâs always something around the corner that catches your attention, sometimes with the rooms and machines complimenting each other visually. This museum made me think. Really nicely done. Zwolle, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â computermuseum.nl In the 2000s, the Computer History Museumâs then-new location had an interim state called The Visible Storage: raw shelves, filled with computers. There were some plaques, but most stories came from volunteer docents (I eventually became one of them) running the show. The Dutch Bonami museum is that, except there are no docents. Oh, and the whole place is massive. I have never seen this many microcomputers under one roof. Not even close. I think there must be thousands of computers here, and itâs funny how just the scale alone elevates the museum. Without that scale, there would be so much room for improvement. Turn on more of these computers so you can play with them (currently, only a scant few are allowed this). Tell better stories. Add production value. But turns out, sometimes scale is enough. Enter Bonami and you feel awash in microcomputers, surrounded by what feels like the entirety of the 1980s and the 1990s. You can compare small differences between models, ponder design details, find obscure machines you didnât know existed. Itâs worth checking it out to see how this amount of computers makes you feel. Helmond, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â homecomputermuseum.nl Perhaps an apotheosis of a certain kind of a computer museum: all microcomputers, some turned on, catering to nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s. Thereâs nothing bad about this approach, but many places do that and after a while it all feels kind of sameây. Not here. Many of the machines here are in working condition and ready to play, which is already very nice. And there will be a few surprises: restoring a Dutch graphics computer Aesthedes with an impressive island of a keyboard, a few Dutch machines like the distinctively shaped Holborn and Eindhovenâs CHE-1, or a âtime machineâ 1990 Tulip computer that allows you to browse the internet like it appeared decades ago. The design and decor are slightly better than elsewhere, too, with various thematic displays, and an open, welcoming feel â and generally it feels the museum is cared for in a way many are not. Mountain View, CaliforniaÂ /Â Visited in 2009â2023 /Â computerhistory.org I love this museum. I wrote about this at least once. I made friends here, learned about storytelling here, hung out with a lot of great volunteers, practiced old-computer photography, and deepened my care and understanding of tech history. The building is great, the demo rooms with PDP-1 and IBM 1401 are fantastic (you can play one of the first videogames against the very person who made it!), and events can be extraordinary too: be it Vintage Computer Festival West, or occasional talks. I miss it now that I live further away. The reason this museum didnât make the main list is that the main exhibit is only kind ofâ¦ okay. There is nothing bad about it, but there is nothing great, eitherÂ âÂ no singular thing stands out. The design is just fine, the videos on exhibit screens are a bit garish (one example here), and no particular memorable design decision or anything really stands out to me. The ending of the main exhibit timeline also kind of peters out, with the web feeling like its weakest part. The museum excels in storytelling through hardware, but things take a dive when things move to software. (To be fair, I am not sure I found a great museum that showcases software well!) SeattleÂ /Â Visited in 2010, 2016, 2019 /Â telcomhistory.org RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â houwelingtelecommuseum.nl Grouping two independent museums in Seattle and Rotterdam because they feel strangely similar, hosted in old telephone exchange buildings, with their infrastructure decommissioned but preserved, restored, and used locally for demonstrations. Itâs a fantastic vibe, walking around among tall stacks of technology that occasionally wake up clacking right next to you. Thereâs a certain scale (huge) and feel (electromechanical) of old machinery that cannot be captured by online photos â but you can experience it in person here. Each of the two museums also hosts a more traditional exhibit in an adjacent room: a general story of telephony and related technologies. In both cases, there is more than you would expect. BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â Site My experience with this museum was colored by the fact that itâs only open once a month. When I visited Berlin, I only thought about searching for a transport museum with two days to spareâ¦ and it just happened to be open on one of these days. Talk about some lucky timing! This museum is basically a time machine, an old subway station building preserved and in many ways left intact. There is little information around; I bet this functions more as a place for docents to shine. But still, so much great texture! A beautiful building, old machinery, porcelain placards with exquisite German typography, the clocks, the lights, the colorsâ¦ That alone elevated it to something wonderful. I could soak in this forever. LondonÂ /Â Visited in 2023 /Â ltmuseum.co.uk I always thought the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden has an absolutely world-class museum store, but the museum itself is much too small. Turns out there they have an answer to that: a huge depot further out from the city center that you can visit on a tour by appointment, filled with vehicles and artifacts. Itâs great, similar in nature to the Computer History Museumâs Visible Storage or Bonami I just mentioned above; this is where the strength of the collection is most of the allure. The only downside here is that you can only move around semi-freely, as everything is a tour (although there are, apparently, also open days), but otherwise this is a great museum chronicling the stories behind possibly the worldâs most fascinating transit system, satisfying both the hardware and the design sides of my brain. MilwaukeeÂ /Â Visited in 2017 This was an amateurish museum, but the word âamateurâ can bite in either direction, and here it felt positive: an old manâs personal collection of microphones, intimately tied to his career, just a few notches away from hoarding, open only by appointment. I loved it. I got a tour by Mr. Paquette himself, and a few demos, one including putting something of unknown provenance right in my mouth. I donât know if this collection passes some sort of theoretical or academic scrutiny, but the passion alone was palpable and enough. Mr. Paquette died since (you can read this interview to get to know him more), and the museum was subsequently dismantled. So it goes. I am happy that I drove by it that one day in 2017. RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â rotterdamsradiomuseum.nl A similar thing to Paquetteâs Microphone Museum, hiding on a third floor of a seemingly unrelated Dutch company. The name is misleading â this is more of a monument to the entire hi-fi era, with radios flanked by record players, tape players, CD players, hi-fi systems, and so on. If youâre into this kind of stuff (I am!), this is delightful; a very nice collection of equipment with all its quirks and strange UI conventions, and some old volunteers willing to explain â if you speak Dutch, that is. North of San FranciscoÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â Site In a list that already stretches the definition of museum, this bends it past a breaking point. KPH is an old maritime radio station, frozen in time for decades, and now occasionally resurrected not for tours or demonstrations, but for volunteers toâ¦ use it once again to communicate with the ships hanging out nearby. I remain enchanted with this building a drive away from San Francisco, where time now stands still. It captures an industry obscure to most, with teletype machines and Morse code mills, which adds a level of authenticity. There is a layer of translation that might be missing to some, but that makes it ever so sweeter if you manage to translate it yourself. ParisÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â arts-et-metiers.net WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â nmt.waw.pl I used to look down on old tech museums in buildings from a different era. I thought them old and creaky, in desperate need of a whole week of coordinated dusting, themselves needing to be packaged in some sort of a metamuseum â âlook how tech museums used to be made.â Perhaps growing older softened that stance, or maybe it was visiting of many museums that felt more modern, yet completely soulless. Both of these are old, but worth a visit. They feel like institutions subscribing to an early definition of a âmuseumâ âÂ a historical building, a bit of a distance and aloofness, maybe even some holier-than-thou attitude. But that can also be in a way inspiring, and doesnât mean you canât have fun or learn new things. I mentioned âprideâ earlier. Here the right word might perhaps be ârespectâ or âreverence.â A museum can overdo it, of course, but I think these two get the balance right. And, if not, you can just come for the buildings. North of BarcelonaÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â mnactec.cat A cool museum north of Barcelona that hosts a sliver of computing history you donât see often: European mainframes. Iâm worried that this might mean this part of the museum is not as popular as others â I imagine nostalgia for mainframes is a small sliver of nostalgia for microcomputers â but I appreciate it. There are a lot of microcomputer museums, but not enough of this. Mainframes require a lot of room and this museum has that, being in an old building that used to be a cotton mill that itself is part of the attraction. (Also, there is a lot more in the collection, specifically textile mills and cars.) CracowÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â mit.krakow.pl I keep harping about âbig buildingsâ and âhuge collectionsâ as something becomes clear in my head: the museums often have an advantage of size. Itâs not that you cannot have a tiny museum that works and means something to peopleâ¦ but if you have a huge building or an impressive collection and you use it well âÂ you have something that few can replicate. This city tech museum in KrakÃ³w reminded me of that rule in a very simple way: It has human-size photos that are really impressive. Thatâs it. That alone felt worth a price of admission, seeing Poland as it used to be a century ago, like you canât in any other setting. I might have never moved less at a museum, just standing next to each photo for many minutes on end, noticing all the little details. (It reminded me of Rick and Megan Prelingerâs Lost Landscapes of San Francisco, which approaches this in a very different format by putting people in a movie theatre once a year and have them watch â and react! â to old clips of San Francisco.) Many other design details here made me happy, from typography wrapping around, to dramatic lighting. (Unfortunately, some exhibits here are much more traditional and maybe a bit, to me, boring.) WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â neonmuzeum.org This museum looks good on insta, but it also looks really good in real life. Sometimes itâs as simple as that. For someone who cares about design and a typography, this was really fun and inspiring. But this is not just some sort of a tourist trap or a âmuseum of ice creamâ pop-up experience for social. Iâve already watched a movie about their preservation efforts, and have one of their books as well. I wanted to visit it because I like patronizing places where I feel people care, and in hindsight, I have been underestimating the effort and care here. By the way, this is in the same fascinating building in Warsaw as Narodowe Muzeum Techniki. WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â muzeum.pgnig.pl This museum is hiding in an old gasworks factory, with some impressive decommissioned machinery. An interesting choice here is that the old building â a once-grimy hall with scary pumps and boilers â is connected with a brand new exhibit, painted in immaculate white, and really nicely put together. Unfortunately (and ironically), the museum feels too small, and some of the interactive parts in the ânewâ section fall a bit flat (although I liked how the ticket serves dual duty as a fake employment card you can punch and use elsewhere, and serves as a nice memento). The small size might be disappointing if you trek out here for a visit, and I hope the museum will expand in the future â but then again, I visited it and enjoyed it. Szczecin, PolandÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â muzeumtechniki.eu There are many museums like this â another âvisible storageâ with a bunch of vintage cars and trams under a roof, and not more else (at least not in 2018 when I visited it last), but Iâm putting this on the list for two reasons. First, itâs in my home town! Second, all the vehicles are in an absolutely immaculate condition. This felt important to me when putting together photos for my book âÂ I wanted these machines to never feel decrepit, abused, unloved. Itâs the same here. The exhibit is well lit and airy; compared to many other museums where this kind of a setup would be dingy and dusty, this feels almost like a show room, which I appreciated. (I missed some plaques explaining things, but also appreciated the minimalism and undisturbed sightlines. The museum in ÅÃ³dÅº, just below, solved it well by giving you a gorgeous book you could refer to. This could be a fun solution here.) ÅÃ³dÅºÂ /Â Visited in 2025 / cmwl.pl I was pleasantly surprised by this museum in Polandâs rough equivalent of Detroit â once again, blending the old and the new. A live demo of textile machines given by a guy with a certain attitude was fun (opinionated docents almost always are!), but what really impressed me was the book that I was given for free upon entry. Itâs professional, well-written, and made me revisit what I saw and learned in a different way after I left the building. I really liked this idea and I wish more museums did that. MadridÂ /Â Visited in 2022 / museosmetromadrid.es A simple story: I didnât understand much of the tour because of the language barrier, but I could move around freely and take photos of this fascinating building hosting a 100-year-old engine shed once used by Madridâs metro, and it was fascinating. Just the vibes were enough for me. I donât love putting museums on blast because so much of this stuff is contextual, and I might not even be the right customer anyway! So I wanted to talk about a few I didnât like mostly as a way to highlight whatâs important to me and why they didnât work for me â figuring it all out via some negative examples. As I mentioned above, this museum is just okay â but could be so, so great if it cared about density â there are many spaces and corridors here absolutely devoid of anything. You have tons of space and tons of stuff in the collection. Why waste it like this? To me it feels important that a museum âmeets your freakâ âÂ if you want to just scan and have fun and take a selfie and leave after 15 minutes, this should work. But there should always be more. There should always be too much for one visit, a certain sense of overwhelm and exhaustion and the depth of history. This doesnât have to be in the amount of exhibits or space to cover, but it could be a fractal â a few exhibits, but each one with a lot of details if you want to go deeper; a few dedicated tours or demos; videos to watch or books to read and come back. I know this is not always possible, but âthe second dateâ â coming back to a museum where you already know the ground rules and established some understanding of what a place is and what are its âdimensions,â and you can just revel in details and connecting things together â can be one of the best things ever. The thing I mentioned above about âold and creaky and in need to be dustedâ? Thatâs what this museum feels like. They boast being the oldest book-related museum in the world which should feel like heaven, right? But I found this museum mostly kind ofâ¦ lazy, with exhibits that are simple and uninspiring. I can see some people finding it intimate, but to me this is a museum that ran out of energy and care, and exchanged it with pretense. To me, books deserve so much more. Maybe whatâs important for me is good combination of creativity and care on display â in putting things together, in designing the exhibits, in even one crucial restoration, in small but meaningful details. I donât know if this counts as a tech museum, but this was such a miserable experience. One thing I absolutely hate for museums is being boring and this one is an exemplary boring experience: boring exhibits, boring visuals, boring layout. I realized this in the moment, and also later when I noticed I didnât take one single photo, which is rare for me. The museum is in a dingy underground space, and it just feels old in that 1970s brutalist way where you canât even appreciate the vintage. I worry itâs these kind of places that give museums a bad name â you visit one on a school trip, and you develop a sense that all museums are a waste of time. To perhaps oversimplify the three anti-examples above: I love tech museums that are rich in content, rich in effort, and rich in curiosity â but not necessarily just rich. The 20+ I listed above have all of that in spades, and deserve recognition for that. Thatâs it! I hope you enjoyed this little tour. I also thought it was fun to look at all the logos of the âgoodâ museums. Theyâre not all perfect, but itâs fun to see the themes emerging â including at least 5 places using the shape of their building in the logo! Many of these feel like logos for subway systems, which is also fun to realize. Thank you for reading or scanning all the way to the end. I am always curious about your suggestions of places you loved that I should visit â please let me know if you have any! Copyright Â© Marcin Wichary Published on 5 January 2026.

Title: Data Centers Continue to Vacuum Up the Investment Dollars — Is the Return Worth It?

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If 2025 will be remembered for anything — outside of the return of President Donald J. Trump and the rise of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani — it will undoubtedly be the establishment of artificial intelligence across the American economy. And with this revolutionary technology has come the concomitant explosion of U.S. data center development — real estate assets solely capable of operating, and powering, the new landscape of AI technology. An S&P Global study from December, first reported by CNBC, found that more than $61 billion of new investment capital flowed into the data center space in 2025, which is just ahead of the $60.8 billion that entered the space in 2024. Ratings giant Moody’s expects global investment in new data centers will reach $2.2 trillion combined in the five years preceding 2028, while U.S. Census Bureau data forecasts that data center construction spending will surpass all U.S. office building construction spending by next year. One major player, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (neé Facebook), estimated it spent between $70 billion and $72 billion in building out AI infrastructure in 2025, per third-quarter earnings. “Everything’s moving into data centers,” said Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, the global law firm. “So, what I’m telling clients is, at some point, we’re going to be oversaturated with data centers, and I don’t quite know what the exit strategy is for being in the data center space. “Having said that, I think we’re really at the infancy of that industry,” he added With money flowing this quickly, and in such large amounts, into a single commercial real estate asset class — an untraditional one, by any measure, that fuses land, utilities, power and fossil fuels, big tech, local politics and Wall Street under one big umbrella — questions are starting to emerge as to whether a bubble is forming around AI data center spending. “The projections of data center development by major tech players are truly eye-popping,” said Chris Russo, vice president of the energy practice at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. “But there’s a growing number of questions whether the projections are, in fact, real, and if the investments being made by Meta, Google, Microsoft, among others, can be justified by future revenue.” This concern about revenue and monetization lies at the heart of the data center development conundrum. For instance, OpenAI, the Silicon Valley firm that initiated the AI wave three years ago through its revolutionary ChatGPT large language model (LLM) application, is not merely one of the biggest players in the data center space. It’s an underwater one, as well. The fact is, despite the hype, OpenAI is currently generating the largest cumulative losses ever for any startup before turning a profit. A Dec. 4, 2025, study by Deutsche Bank economists found that OpenAI has revenue forecasts of $345 billion between 2024 and 2029, but it comes after $488 billion in spending on data center computer power. That means the firm will run a cash-flow of negative $143 billion. Patrick Wilson, a portfolio manager at CenterSquare Investment Management, said the largest hyperscale data center developments haven’t yet been able to monetize AI technologies, and that, at some point, capital expenditures will start to plateau if investors continue to spend like this. That would signal a risk to investors who are paying for enormous valuations without much in the way of consistent and long-term revenue streams. “At some point, by 2027 or later, the market will want to see some sort of path to monetization for a lot of this spending because the return on investment capital is so paltry, if not nonexistent,” Wilson said. “So I do start to get concerned.” Investors aren’t scared yet. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts found that publicly traded real estate companies increased investments into data centers by 15 percent last year, while research from Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, found that debt market players borrowed $100 billion for data center development in 2025. “2025 was a bit of the early stage of a gold rush, per se, with tons of new entrants, operators, capital providers and tenants,” said Andrew Kaskel, head of data centers advisory at Walker & Dunlop. “While there certainly were a lot of projects announced and funded, it’s really still the early stage of a big growth cycle.” But is it a bubble? Kaskel admitted that, sure, there’s always a chance we’ve entered into a bubble and that things will go south once interest rates rise and demand shifts, as has happened before, particularly during the 1999-2001 dot-com bubble. But this rush of data center development, and AI spending, is fundamentally different for one critical reason. “What we see, day in and day out, and across the data center space, is that the majority of the capital being allocated and invested is backed by the largest, most stable companies in the world, with the healthiest balance sheets on the planet,” said Kaskel. “It’s foundationally built upon really secure companies for the long term.” JLL research found that of the 8 gigawatts of U.S. data centers currently under construction, 73 percent is pre-leased, while vacancies are expected to remain below 5 percent into 2027, and likely hold closer to 2 percent. “Looking at the fundamentals, there is no bubble,” said Sean Farney, vice president of Americas data center strategy at JLL. “Ninety-seven percent of the existing product is utilized, we are the envy of every other industry on Earth. … So the fundamental demand for the product is there, and it’s only getting higher as supply is getting lower.” Even so, this same JLL research report concluded that data center co-location vacancy rates that sit near zero percent are “constraining economic growth and undermining national security,” and that the “restrictive market conditions are counterproductive over the long term.” So, while the money is there, questions abound and answers are few as to who wins and loses as U.S. data center development explodes — with all eyes on the uncertain path the hyperscalers might chart to monetization as the central metric of whether the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital will actually be paid back. “We’re a big believer in AI and data enters over the short term, the medium term and the long term,” said Rich Hill, global head of real estate research and strategy at Principal Asset Management. “But every single data center investor might not have a good experience.” Whole new ballgame To understand where data centers might be going, it’s important to understand what they are as an asset class, as like any piece of real estate there is nuance in the bricks and mortar. Since emerging out of the telecommunications building boom that laid the groundwork for the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, data centers have evolved today into an asset of three distinct classes. There are cloud data centers, which are used to power Americans who shop on Amazon, or search Google, or use their iPhones to save photos on an invisible cloud network. Then there are AI inference data centers, which power the large language models of ChatGPT. Finally, there are much physically larger (and prohibitively more expensive) generative AI data centers, or factories, which are a training model for future AI use — often referred to as “neocloud” — that is still unknown. Data centers within these three classes are either leased to hyperscalers, like Oracle or Meta, or are co-locations, meaning multi-tenant tenant spaces that could include up-and-coming cloud platforms like CoreWeave and Fluidstack. “There’s a lot of money going into generative AI data center development, and we view it as much more speculative, with not as much pre-leasing occurring,” said Principal’s Hill. “I’m not here to tell you if it’s good or bad, a bubble or not a bubble, but we think it’s a much better risk-adjusted return focusing on cloud and AI inference data centers.” Today there are 4,165 data centers in the U.S., an average of 83 per state. The nearest countries by count — the United Kingdom and Germany — have only 499 and 487, respectively, per Statista, a statistics website. Those numbers themselves suggest room for foreign competition on the data center front, and on AI, adding another level of uncertainty to the growth and demand in the U.S. Kristina Metzger, vice chairman at CBRE’s data center capital markets, said national core data center fundamentals are “fantastic,” with less than 2 percent vacancy, 80 percent of the development pipeline pre-leased, little to no speculative development, growing rents, and positive earnings (15 percent year-over-year), all on the back of cloud computing. But it’s the gen AI hubs that have given her pause, mainly due to questions on long-term use and overall business models. “What we’re now working through are new facets of the industry with these AI factories, and neocloud operating models, and those [business models] remain to be determined,” she said. “There isn’t the same overall story as there is in core data centers.” Dave Powell, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, specializes in data centers. He noted that there are numerous expensive questions associated with any data center development. For instance, is an end-user lined up? Is it a big tech firm or not? Will it be a hyperscale site or co-location? And, most importantly, is there a reliable source of power to make the investment pencil? “We really see that it’s all about power — electricity generation is reaching new heights … and with respect to electricity, it’s divided up by markets, and not all markets are created equal,” said Powell. “To develop a data center, you need reliable electricity, which should be relatively inexpensive, you need land, you need to be near a major metropolitan area with favorable, or non-penalizing, regulations from the local government.” Even after all these questions are answered, and the data center is finally built (in compliance with the maze of local zoning codes, of course), perhaps the biggest open-ended question is how investors will make money on an asset class whose tenants still haven’t figured out how to monetize the actual “data” propping up the multibillion-dollar “center.” “It’s a question we hear day in and day out: What is the exit and how do people ultimately get returns? And it’s still to be determined,” said Walker & Dunlop’s Kaskel. “Right now, so much of the capital is being invested on the construction and development side, and these projects are three- to five- to 10-year developments before they reach 100 percent stabilization.” Generational dollars Even amid a laundry list of uncertainties, money has poured into the space since ChatGPT came online in 2022. By 2025, even after years of Wall Street capital behind it, what pushed data centers to another level was the Trump administration’s support for the industry, primarily Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion private sector investment in the construction of 20 new data centers, collectively spanning 10 million square feet, on his first full day back in office. “We have a clear policy to support the data center builds and the recognition that data centers are part of a strategic advantage,” JLL’s Farney said of the nation at large. “[The industry] came into its own in 2025, where there was wide recognition, not just in [big tech] but in financial services, that AI is a critical component of the economy and the value-prop for every company on the face of the Earth.” The evolution of AI has come as the data center space has experienced its own metamorphosis in recent years when it comes to investment capital. Previously, data centers as an asset class were a long-term, buy-and-hold play by public real estate investment trusts (REITs), which don’t tend to sell. But the public REITs eventually realized that cash flows on data centers tended to plateau once they were leased, making them a dilutive investment for public market investors always under the gun to raise debt or equity to acquire more assets and generate quarterly returns. Cue the private equity music. The early 2020s saw Blackstone buy REIT QTS for $10 billion, American Tower purchase CoreSite for $10.1 billion, and KKR scoop up CyrusOne for $15 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the big deals continued. DigitalBridge and Silver Lake bought Vantage Data Centers, a hyperscale data center developer, in a $9.2 billion equity investment, while a consortium backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI purchased Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest deal to date. For many of these acquisitions involving the big-name hyperscalers, the money is chasing profits in the nebulous AI factory space, where many risks remain. “AI factories are quite sizable, so you’re looking at construction budgets north of $20 billion in many instances, so from an equity perspective that takeout remains to be determined, or if it’s something better suited for the public markets,” said CBRE’s Metzger. “There’s just some unknowns. None of these have delivered yet, so that process of overall monetization hasn’t taken place yet … and for some investors these might be very long-term holds.” One reason why investors have jumped so eagerly into the data center space, including the generative AI factory arena, is because of the valuations hyperscalers have experienced in the last five years, especially since AI went mainstream in 2022. Since December 2020, Google’s stock price has increased 258 percent; Microsoft’s has risen 119 percent; Meta’s 144 percent; Apple is up 105 percent; and Oracle’s stock price is 205 percent higher. “People have a general sense of a bubble, but for me it’s irrational investment behavior, and that can be both on the investment side, with capital going in, but also irrational valuations around the companies that are in there,” said CenterSquare’s Wilson. Wilson emphasized that before 2025, public REITs drove the capital into the sector. But today, with hundreds of billions of dollars required for development platforms, REITs are “incredibly small scale” compared to the private players, particularly the Big 4 Silicon Valley firms. He said Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were estimated to deploy $350 billion into the space through 2025 and are expected to invest another $511 billion in 2026. “There’s some thought it might go up, but it will get tougher and tougher to deploy starting in 2028,” he added. “A lot of the physical space will be taken up and installed, there’ll be tremendously tighter markets, and you’ll be going into the tertiary markets in North Dakota, Louisiana, west Texas, and so you do start to bump up against the level where capital expenditures plateau.” Snap, crackle and pop To even a true data center bull like JLL’s Farney, ever since Wall Street jumped into the industry in the early 2020s, the valuations for AI and data centers have been “bonkers,” but that doesn’t mean they’re dangerously priced. “Absolutely, there’s a bubble in equity pricing, along the entire value chain, but when it comes to the fundamentals of business, it’s in no way [a bubble],” he said. “No one can show me the demand is not there.” Sure, demand is all well and good, but industry experts like Chris Russo, who makes a living advising on data center economics, argue there are major, existential questions on how generative AI will be monetized. It could come in the form of all of corporate America adopting a gen AI Microsoft Co-Pilot, which is powered by ChatGPT, or life sciences firms adopting AI hyperscaler technology for research, or every white-collar business in the country automating its human workers as AI chatbots. But those remain theories, if not science fiction. “All of the investment in AI is to ultimately produce LLMs, or AI generative intelligence, but at some point people need to pay to use it as a product,” Russo said, emphasizing that revenue must appear in the flesh to justify investment. “If trillions of dollars are being committed in capital, then there needs to be trillions of dollars of capital to support it,” he added. “The money needs to come from somewhere, and where the money comes from right now is still questionable.” Right now, AI relies on a subscription model, where users pay per month. While the expectation is that large-scale corporate subscriptions will integrate these different AI technologies into their numerous businesses, the real bet is on AI getting intertwined into the everyday lives of ordinary Americans in myriad, unheard-of ways. “The hope is it gets embedded into a lot more areas of your life, and so as these things get better at image recognition, machine learning through visuals, it might integrate into wearables, and it could be embedded into autonomous vehicles diagnostics,” said Wilson. “That’s the thought, but we’re at this precipice, and, if anyone says they know where this technology is headed, call them crazy.” Another wild card in the entire narrative is the power struggle. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could account for anywhere from 5 percent to 9 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute forecasts data center electricity demand will reach 130 gigawatts by 2030, and account for 12 percent of U.S. electricity demand. And some of the numbers now being forecast are not just jaw-dropping, but in some cases fanciful. CNBC reported the Electric Reliability Council of Texas projects 220 gigawatts of large data center developments have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030. Mike Hogan, senior adviser to Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit think tank that advises on energy policy, noted that 225 gigawatts of new data center demand in Texas is almost six times the current peak load of the whole state, which is projected to be 40 gigawatts by 2030, and that the U.S. power grid is 900 gigawatts total. “It’s very, very difficult to imagine that all of that development is for real,” said Hogan, who noted many data center development contracts counted are duplicative across states, or speculative. “I’m far from alone in thinking that we’re in the middle of a bubble. But it’s also true that if only 10 percent of that comes through, it’s a significant amount of new load.” Russo, another skeptic, noted that, right now, data center developers are “almost indifferent to what energy costs,” because returns are currently so high, while the average American voter might not be so amenable to increased energy bills due to the wave of new data center deals. “Data centers are making clear one of the fundamental principles of markets: When something is scarce, it becomes expensive, and, at the moment, there is a very large demand for electricity from data centers and consumers, and that increases prices,” he said. “Everyone loves market incentives, but nobody likes the side effects of higher bills.” Even if the access to power for data center developers has immediate solutions — JLL’s Farney noted that large consumers are creating their own multistate natural gas arrangements, while also investing heavily into alternatives to existing grid technology via nuclear power, coal and solar — there is still the threat inherent in the technology itself. Unlike railroad infrastructure or telecommunication fiber optic cables, the chips built today that power data centers won’t be useful in five years, let alone 100 years, according to Russo. “The speed at which this technology depreciates — and a lot of the value is consumed very quickly — is astonishing compared to other industries,” he said. “It’s like developing an office building and replacing the plumbing and wiring almost immediately.” CenterSquare’s Wilson said the bubble threat to the market isn’t so much like the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but more like the boom-and-bust cycle that occurred during the growth of the railroad industry in the 19th century. “I do think this is a huge inflection point in society going forward,” he said. “This isn’t a fad, but there will be, like there always is in bubbles, if we can call this a bubble, wreckage, and there will be losers.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: How the Stock Market Could Sink Trump in 2026
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-stock-market-ahead-of-midterms-by-desmond-lachman-2026-01
Time Published: 2026-01-05T14:46:27Z
Full Content:
By emphasizing how well the US stock market is doing, US President Donald Trump could be setting himself up for electoral disappointment this November. With equities priced for perfection, any number of risks could deflate today's exuberance. WASHINGTON, DC – In a recent campaign-style speech, US President Donald Trump asserted that “the only thing that’s really going up, big, it’s called the stock market, and your 401(k).” He has a point: all major US stock indices realized double-digit percentage gains last year. And yet, the November midterm elections are still a long way off. Were there to be a stock-market correction in the meantime, Trump’s economic point of pride could become a liability. Unfortunately for Trump, a market correction (a 10-20% decline) does seem highly probable this year. There is an unusually high degree of optimism priced into the market, making stocks susceptible to a large pullback in the event of an economic setback – which any number of economic or political “known unknowns” could cause in the run-up to the midterms. Consider the current optimism. It would be an understatement to say that stocks are priced at lofty valuations; in fact, they are priced for economic perfection. As measured by the Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio, the S&P 500 is valued at more than twice its long-term average, and at close to its pre-2001 dot-com high. And as measured by the Buffett Indicator – the ratio of the total US stock-market valuation to US GDP – the market is trading at an all-time record, some 50% above its 2008 high. Another measure of optimism is the current bullishness on the part of fund managers. According to Bank of America, these influential voices are more exuberant now than at any point in the past three years, and their current cash holdings have plummeted to their lowest level on record. Again, such sentiment – and the bets that follow from it – would seem to set the market up for a major pullback should the economy falter in the coming months. Why might that happen? One need only consider the country’s unsustainable public finances, coupled with the threat Trump poses to the US Federal Reserve’s independence, to envisage a return of the bond market vigilantes and a spike in long-term interest rates. Heightening this risk is the country’s high dependence on foreigners to finance its $2 trillion annual budget deficit. If foreigners come to think that the US government will try to inflate away its debt, they will demand higher interest payments on their US Treasury bond holdings, which would increase the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and many other common forms of borrowing. Another domestic risk is the AI bubble, which could burst or deflate at any time. This risk is especially acute considering that as much as half of US GDP growth is being driven by AI-related investment. Moreover, the end of the AI bubble would have a chilling effect on the stock prices of the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), whose combined valuation is around 35% of the S&P 500’s total. Oracle, whose stock price already fell 30% last quarter, could prove to be the canary in the coal mine. Our annual flagship magazine, PS Quarterly: The Year Ahead 2026, is here!

One such shock could come from China, which is still relying excessively on an investment- and export-centric model to drive its economy. With China’s trade surplus now exceeding $1 trillion, increased US and European protectionism has become more likely, and with it, a further breakdown in the international trading system. Another shock could come from Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s pursuit of an irresponsible budget policy has raised fears of a “Liz Truss moment” that could send Japanese government bond yields sharply higher (as happened in the United Kingdom in the fall of 2022). Were that to occur, we could see a disruptive unwinding of the Japanese carry trade (borrowing at a lower interest rate in one country to invest in assets elsewhere) and the repatriation of Japanese capital that has been supporting US financial markets. Finally, as last weekend’s US military operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets. Even before Trump announced that the US plans to “run” Venezuela until a “proper” transition can take place, China was conducting live military drills in the Taiwan Strait, and Russia was dragging its feet on a peace settlement with Ukraine. China might try to capitalize on this moment to regain control over Taiwan, and Russia may be emboldened to make even more ambitious demands for territorial concessions from Ukraine. Even the smallest possibility of a conflict over Taiwan should be deeply concerning, considering that it supplies more than half the world’s semiconductors. If those who live by the sword die by the sword, the same may be true of equity prices in the run-up to this year’s midterm elections. By emphasizing how well the stock market is doing now, Trump could be setting himself up for disappointment if any number of risks materialize.

But while the odds of a major market correction in the next few years appear uncomfortably high, heading for the exits now could be premature. The global AI race will be won not by the power of models and chips, but by how effectively systems can be deployed and improved across the economy. China’s chronic excess capacity, long seen as its greatest weakness, has reduced costs and accelerated adoption, providing the country's AI sector with a decisive edge.

Top navigation Buffer’s features Supported social media channels Buffer’s resources Blog navigation Buffer’s blog topics Breadcrumbs PublishedJan 5, 2026 Discover 28 essential digital marketing tools that help growing brands succeed without breaking the bank — including free and affordable options. Big marketing dreams, but working with a tight budget? After more than a decade of marketing for bootstrapped brands, I've learned that you don't need to spend a fortune on fancy digital marketing tools to see results. It's all about building a smart toolkit that punches above its weight. One that helps you work efficiently and get results without breaking the bank. That's where this comprehensive list comes in: 28 digital marketing tools that help growing brands succeed. Many of these tools offer free or low-cost versions, so you can start small and scale up as you're ready for more features. Consider this your guide to building a powerful marketing tech stack that works within your budget. These social media tools help you maintain a consistent social media presence and evaluate your content performance. A social media management tool is central to any social strategy. It helps you manage your online presence so you can post consistently and on a schedule you choose — which can help improve engagement. I've been a Buffer customer and fan for nine years, long before I started contributing to the blog. And, when I became more active in building my personal brand a year ago, Buffer was the natural choice. Since this is the Buffer blog, we're naturally excited to share how Buffer can help with your social media management. The good stuff: The Create space is one of my favorite features. Here's my current setup: I log all my half-baked ideas here and move them along in my custom Kanban board as they progress. I even have a prompts category for ideas in case I get stuck (many of which came from Buffer's Creator Camp) — but there's a nifty "generate ideas" button that can jumpstart your content creation. From here, adding a finished post to my queue for publishing is super easy. And with Buffer's pay-by-channel pricing model, I've been able to scale the services I pay for up and down based on what I need. For example, I used to be active on both LinkedIn and X, but now I'm only on LinkedIn. That flexibility is helpful since every dollar counts as I grow my freelance business. Plus, if you're experimenting with newer platform options, Buffer quickly adds support for new social platforms (hello, Mastodon and Bluesky). Buffer shines brightest for small businesses, solopreneurs, and creators looking to streamline their social media game without getting lost in complex features. It's the perfect balance of powerful and user-friendly — just what you need to make your social media presence pop without the headache. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $6/month/channel. Have you ever wondered what people say about your brand when you're not looking? That's where social listening comes in — and Mentionlytics makes it accessible even if you're working with a tight budget. Many social listening tools cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for small businesses. But Mentionlytics brings these powerful capabilities to small businesses at a fraction of the cost. The good stuff: The drag-and-drop report builder also lets you create custom reports to share insights with your team. Whether you're looking to improve your customer service, gather product feedback, or keep tabs on your online reputation, Mentionlytics could be a valuable addition to your digital marketing toolkit. Pricing: Starts at $69/month. Ultimately, you'll want to differentiate your social media marketing strategy from your competitors', so you don't want to copy them. But checking out what they're doing with a competitive analysis tool can help you understand their strategy and inform your own. Predis.ai surfaces these insights and can even help you generate content based on what's working in your industry. The good stuff: All in all, Predis.ai is worth considering to learn from the wins and mistakes of your competitors so you don't have to learn them yourself the hard way. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $32/month. This next great digital marketing tool has been mentioned by several folks I respect who are growing their personal brands on social media. If you ever find it hard to keep your social media queue full, Quuu can help curate content from around the web that interests your audience. Then, you can blend original posts with curated content that gets conversations going without manually searching for share-worthy content. Quuu uses AI to curate content and draft posts suitable for your audience. The good stuff: Whether you're looking to establish thought leadership, keep your audience informed, or maintain a consistent posting schedule, Quuu can save time while keeping you up-to-date and relevant. Pricing: 7-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $19.79/month per social media profile. Partnership marketing is great for businesses of all sizes. It enables you to expand your brand's reach through exposure to the audiences others have already built. However, managing these relationships can get a bit fiddly if you rely on spreadsheets and email threads. These digital marketing tools can help you track relationships, streamline outreach, manage campaigns, and measure the impact of your collaborations. Many influencer marketing tools are in the thousands per month. But Influencity makes influencer marketing management a lot more achievable for those with a modest budget. The good stuff: Influencity is perfect for brands looking to dip their toes into influencer marketing for the first time or those who don't have a large budget but want to level up from managing with spreadsheets. Pricing: 7-day free trial available. Contact Influencity for pricing information. In the five years I spent managing partnerships at Tortuga, I can't recommend using a CRM for partnerships enough. I used Buzzstream to track brand features and outreach of all kinds, including those with media, bloggers, product review sites, influencers, and affiliates. The good stuff: If you manage many partnerships for your brand, Buzzstream can help you keep all those plates spinning without dropping any. Pricing: 14-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $24/month. After discovering new potential customers through other marketing channels, you'll want a way to stay in direct contact with your audience so you can build deeper relationships and gather first-party data for personalization. Email and SMS marketing can help you nurture leads, maintain existing customer relationships, and drive conversions through personalized, direct communication. When it comes to email marketing tools, Mailchimp is often first to come to mind because it's versatile and approachable for new businesses. The good stuff: Content creator and relationship coach Mike Mantell has used Mailchimp for years to manage their email newsletter. "I find it pretty easy to make lists to distinguish where signups from different lead magnets came from," they share. "It has the basic functionality I need for email marketing." They can even create multiple email sequences on the free plan, which sets Mailchimp apart from other options. However, Mike notes that as your needs grow more complex, you might feel some growing pains: "If I have to edit any of my automations, it takes a long time for me to figure out how. It's a bit unintuitive in that way." If that's the case for you, you may consider upgrading to a specialized tool focused on your niche. Pricing: Free email-only plan for up to 250 contacts. Paid plans start at $13/month. If you're running an e-commerce business, you know Klaviyo. It's been a go-to email marketing tool for online retail stores for years. The good stuff: I've had hands-on experience with Klaviyo at multiple e-commerce brands, and having a provider focused on online retail makes a difference. Klaviyo makes it intuitive to create segments based on your history with a customer, set up automated flows, and track revenue impact. While Klaviyo has been a frontrunner for over a decade, it's worth mentioning that alternatives like Privy and Omnisend offer similar features at comparable price points and are establishing a name for themselves as well. For those with bigger budgets and more complex needs, solutions like Sendlane and Attentive are pushing the envelope with advanced features and top-tier service. On the flip side, if you're a Shopify brand just starting out, Shopify Messaging has a generous free tier for up to 10k emails per month. While it offers fewer features than Klaviyo, it can be a good stepping stone for budding brands. Pricing: Klaviyo has a free plan for up to 250 contacts and 500 monthly email sends. Paid plans start at $20/month for email alone or $35/month for email and SMS. HubSpot is a powerhouse for B2B SaaS companies looking to manage their relationships with leads and customers alongside email marketing. I've used it to manage email marketing for a small tech company, and it was so helpful to be able to peek at a customer's entire journey and history with our brand. The good stuff: The email builder is intuitive. It's also powerful to be able to segment your list based on any data point in your CRM. However, the learning curve can be steep if you're new to marketing automation platforms because HubSpot is packed to the brim with capabilities. It's worth noting that while HubSpot is excellent for B2B, it'll be overkill for simpler email marketing needs. If you're not leveraging its full suite of tools, you might find better value elsewhere. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid Marketing Hub plans start at $20/user/month but can get pricey as you add more contacts and features. Kit is an email marketing platform designed for creators and solopreneurs who sell digital products like courses, ebooks, or coaching services. Kit sets itself apart through its monetization features. The good stuff: Anna Burgess Yang, a freelance writer who helps fellow solopreneurs improve their workflows, swears by Kit's capabilities: "I host a lot of webinars and create free downloads for my audience. Kit makes it easy for me to create landing pages and email sequences. I now have a well-oiled process for launching something new in Kit and segmenting the subscribers into different groups with tags based on what they signed up to receive." Pricing: Free plan for up to 10k subscribers. Paid plans start at $39/month. Several creators I follow have switched to beehiiv recently due to its specialized features. It's a platform designed for creators who see their newsletter as the main event, not just a marketing tool. While platforms like Kit excel at selling digital products, beehiiv shines when the newsletter itself is the value you're offering. It's for those who want to turn their email list into a thriving community and potentially a revenue stream. The good stuff: Buffer's own Senior Content Creator, Tamilore Oladipo, hosts her newsletter, Content-as-a-Career, on beehiiv. "I've tried many newsletter platforms and have found beehiiv to offer the most value for my usual needs," she says. It's also made it easy for Tami to monetize early on: "My favorite thing about the platform is the ability to connect to sponsors easily — I'm already monetizing with just over 1,000 subscribers." As far as more advanced features, Tami shares, "I haven't had to implement anything too complex yet, so I can't say too much about its automation capabilities. But if you're looking to get an MVP (minimum viable product) of your newsletter off the ground, it's a great tool." The platform also offers robust analytics, helping you understand what content resonates with your audience. This data-driven approach can be invaluable for creators looking to grow their readership and influence. Pricing: Free plan for up to 2,500 subscribers. Paid plans start at $49/month. SEO isn't just about pleasing search engines. It's about improving your visibility so you can connect with people searching for what you offer. But search engine optimization can feel like a complex logic puzzle, especially if you're juggling other marketing channels. The right SEO tools can help you decode the mystery of search engine rankings and determine where to focus your efforts. I've been using Moz on and off for nearly a decade. I keep coming back to it for its simple user interface and powerful features — some of which they even grant access to (at a small monthly volume) on the free plan. The good stuff: While Moz offers similar functionality to competitor Ahrefs, I find Ahrefs more robust and intuitive. However, Ahrefs' paid plans start at a higher price point, making Moz a more accessible option for many small businesses. Moz also rocks in the educational content department. Their webinars and SEO guides are excellent resources if you're looking to expand your SEO knowledge. Clearscope co-founder Bernard Huang's episode on ranch-style content marketing is a personal favorite. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $49/month. Frase is a content optimization tool that helps you create SEO-friendly long-form content that ranks well in search results. As a freelance writer, I've used several content optimization tools, including SurferSEO and Clearscope. While they all offer similar core functionality for optimizing blog posts, Frase stands out for its affordability and flexibility. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Frase is its pricing model. As a freelancer, not all of my clients need search optimization, and some provide access to their own software. Frase's monthly subscription option allows me to pay only when I need it, which helps cut down costs compared to annual subscriptions for similar tools. The intuitive interface makes it easy to analyze top-ranking content and ensure my article covers all the necessary topics. Pricing: Starts at $45/month. Google Search Console is a free tool for understanding and improving your site's performance in Google search results. Mike Mantell, the relationship coach and content creator we mentioned earlier, relies on Google Search Console to understand how well their blog posts rank and what search terms bring people to their site. The good stuff: What does Mike love about Google Search Console? "It sends me a regular email to help me gauge my progress. It's cool to see my monthly clicks go up. And I find it helpful to see which pages are growing the fastest. It's gratifying to see my progress and to home in on what's working." Pricing: Completely free. Creating professional, engaging content helps you capture your audience's attention and convey your message effectively. But you might not have the budget for heavy-duty tools or design experience — and that's completely understandable. These tools can bridge the gap, turning your ideas into polished visual content and crafty copy, even without specialized skills. Canva makes graphic design accessible to anyone. I've been using it for years, personally and professionally. It's my go-to tool for creating quick, polished visuals for social media posts, profile banners, and LinkedIn carousels. The good stuff: What I love most about Canva is that you don't need to be an Adobe pro to create professional-looking graphics. The templates are a great starting point, and it's easy to customize them to fit your brand. One standout feature is the ability to resize designs for different social media platforms in one click. This is a huge time-saver when you're creating content for multiple platforms or social media channels with their own size requirements. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $15/month for one person. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's foray into the world of AI-generated images, and it's making waves for good reason. It can help you produce high-quality visuals quickly, especially if you need images for commercial use. The good stuff: Kirsti Lang, a senior content writer at Buffer, took it for a spin. Her opinion was that the free web version is surprisingly powerful. You can specify everything from aspect ratio and art style to depth of field and color tone. One standout feature is the quality of human faces in AI-generated photos. Unlike some other tools, Firefly produces realistic faces without the unsettling "uncanny valley" effect. "My results with Firefly were consistently excellent," Kirsti says, "I found that playing around with the various art styles and effects pre-generated really helped me fine-tune my ask." While the free version is great for experimenting, the watermark-free images in paid plans are worth considering for professional use. Pricing: Free version available with watermark. Paid plans start at $9.99/month. VEED is a simple browser-based video editing tool designed to make video creation accessible to those without extensive editing experience. As someone who's dabbled in more advanced tools like Final Cut Pro, I initially found VEED limiting. However, I appreciate its simplicity for quick edits. The good stuff: What stands out about VEED is its ease of use. While I sometimes wish for more control, that's exactly why it's great for small business owners or marketers who aren't video editing pros. It's hard to make big mistakes with VEED. Pricing: Free version available with watermark. Paid plans start at $24/month. Butter is a specialized video creation tool designed with e-commerce brands in mind, offering a Canva-like experience for short-form product videos. As someone who's worked with e-commerce brands, I appreciate tools that streamline the process of creating engaging product content. Butter does just that for video. The good stuff: Butter really sets itself apart in its focus on creating dynamic product videos from a combination of still shots and video footage. It lets your marketing team create eye-catching assets on the fly for your website, email, SMS, and social media campaigns. It's a tool I wish I had when I was doing marketing for e-commerce brands. It lets you step up your video content without a huge learning curve or budget. Pricing: Plans start at $25/month. Everyone has their go-to AI writing assistant at this point. Claude is mine. It's a large language model, much like ChatGPT, that you can use to brainstorm ideas, generate and edit writing, and repurpose content, among other things. I've experimented with numerous AI writing tools, including ChatGPT, Writer, Jasper, Lex, Copy.ai, and Reword. I've found Claude to be a standout option. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Claude is how human it sounds. The outputs feel more natural and require less editing than many other AI writing tools I've tried. I've also been finding Claude's Projects feature useful lately. You can add resources and custom instructions to use across multiple chats. So you don't need to add the same files and instructions over and over again. For example, I used Claude for an upcoming Buffer article to brainstorm a new outline that will be more skimmable, noting the resources I'd attached to the project: Claude also offers limited use on its free plan. So when my workload is lighter, the free plan suffices, which has led to me only paying for Claude for four out of ten months so far this year. While Claude is great for individual writing tasks, software like Narrato or Blaze might be worth exploring for teams managing large amounts of content. They offer additional features for collaboration, content repurposing, and publishing that I've found intriguing. Pricing: Free version available. Paid plans start at $20/month. Is your website getting traffic, but not enough visitors are taking action? That's where conversion optimization software comes in handy. These digital marketing tools help you maximize your website's effectiveness at turning visitors into leads or customers — so you get more out of all your marketing efforts. Let's talk about A/B testing (or split-testing) with our first conversion optimization software: VWO. A/B testing is used to determine the best way to display different elements on your website that will lead to the most conversions. For example, you might test different colors or copy for your CTAs (calls-to-action) or timing on a popup. The good stuff: VWO is a great option for small businesses due to its approachable pricing that scales with you as you grow. Pricing: 30-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $633/month, billed annually. Another important aspect of conversion optimization is personalizing your website — tailoring your visitors' experience depending on their actions. For example, you might show an exit-intent popup if they're about to leave, or recommend products based on their purchase history and other first-party data you've collected. This is where ConvertFlow comes in. Now, full disclosure: I used to work at ConvertFlow, so I'm a little biased. But I think it's a powerful tool for any business looking to personalize their website and guide their site visitors' experience. The good stuff: What sets ConvertFlow apart is the ability it gives you to create complex, multi-step campaigns without any coding. Its drag-and-drop builder lets anyone on your team create campaigns — something I wish I had at other brands when I had to rely on a designer for any requests. Pricing: Free plan lets you build campaigns, though you'll need to upgrade to publish them on your website. Paid plans start at $299/month. If you're running an online store, getting conversions is one piece of the revenue puzzle. But increasing cart values lets you boost your bottom line without acquiring new customers. Cody Plofker, Chief Marketing and Revenue Officer at Jones Road Beauty, stands by Aftersell to increase average order value through smart upsells and cross-sells. The good stuff: Cody shared in a recent newsletter that he appreciates Aftersell because it has a great team and it's cheaper than similar options. "You can get post-purchase upsells, in-checkout blocks, and network offers in one tool with a capped pricing model," he says. What's particularly clever about Aftersell is its focus on high-intent shoppers. People who already have items in their cart or have just purchased are already in a buying mood, so it's a great time to upsell or cross-sell items they might be interested in. Pricing: Aftersell offers modular pricing, depending on which features you want, starting at $34.99/month. It can be easy to burn through your paid ads budget without seeing results. That's where paid advertising tools come in handy. They help ensure you're maximizing your ROAS (return on ad spend) and targeting the right audiences. Wondering how your Google Ads campaigns are stacking up? Wordstream's Google Ads Performance Grader lets you gain quick, actionable insights — and it's completely free. The good stuff: It takes the complex data from your account and translates it into clear, actionable advice. Pricing: Free. If you've ever felt like you're walking in a dark room when it comes to your Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ads, Atria is like flipping on the lights. The good stuff: Atria is really leaning into its AI features to stand out from other options in this space. Its AI can analyze your best performers and use that data to generate new ad ideas, even providing a conversion score to help you pick the most effective copy. Plus, curated "top picks" showcase winning ads from various industries, giving you a shortcut to what's working right now in paid advertising. Pricing: Free trial available. Paid plans start at $159/month. Marketing analytics tools give you X-ray vision into your marketing efforts. They help you see what's working so you can amplify successful efforts and adjust anything that's falling flat. As far as free tools go, Google Analytics is a powerhouse. I've used it at every company I've worked with for over a decade — and for good reason. It's got a surprising amount of depth and flexibility for a free analytics tool. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Google Analytics is its ability to adapt to your specific business needs. The custom conversion events let you track anything from newsletter signups to product purchases, giving you a clear picture of how users interact with your site. If you don't have the budget to invest in a more comprehensive or automated tool, Google Analytics will give you most of what you need. If you're not already using it, I recommend implementing it ASAP to build up your historical data. There is a paid version (Google Analytics 360), but I've never used it — likely because its hefty starting price of $50k/year is out of reach for most small businesses. Pricing: Free. Hotjar reveals how users interact with your website — taking the guesswork out of your visitor experience. The good stuff: What I love most about Hotjar is how it combines quantitative data with qualitative insights. The heatmaps and recordings show you what users do, while the feedback tools help you understand why they do it. E-commerce retention expert Elliot Kovac praised Hotjar on X for the clarity it brings to user behavior: "You’ll be able to see the biggest drop-off points quite easily and take action to resolve." It's a helpful software for businesses in any industry. Pricing: Free plan for up to 200,000 monthly sessions. Paid plans start at $49/month. If you have a mobile app or web-based digital product, Amplitude's robust analytics platform provides valuable insights into user behavior, ultimately allowing you to improve retention. The good stuff: What sets Amplitude apart is its focus on behavioral cohorts. Instead of just looking at demographics, you can group users based on their actions. This can help you identify your power users and understand what features keep them coming back. Pricing: Free plan for up to 10 million events/month. Paid plans start at $61/month. This is another tool I wish I had when I was working at e-commerce brands. For Shopify store owners, Lifetimely offers a crystal-clear view of customer behavior and lifetime value, helping you make data-driven decisions to boost profitability and grow your store strategically. The good stuff: Plus, the ability to predict customer lifetime value. This insight lets you focus your marketing efforts on your most valuable customers and improve profitability. Max Bidna, who goes by Marketing Max, reports on X that Lifetimely's Shopify charts "are second to none in terms of helping you understand the LTV from different customer segments and from different acquisition channels." Plus, the ability to compare your store's performance against others in your industry gives you a clear picture of where you stand and where you can improve. Bonus: All features are available on all plans, making it easy to grow your Shopify store. Pricing: Free plan up to 50 orders per month. Paid plans start at $149/month. You now have access to a comprehensive collection of digital marketing tools, each designed to help with specific aspects of your marketing efforts. But you don't need to implement everything at once. Start by identifying your most pressing marketing challenges. Is it maintaining a consistent social media presence? Understanding your website visitors' behavior? Or maybe you're looking to get into influencer marketing for the first time? Choose one or two areas to focus on initially and adopt the tools that address those needs. When you're ready to try a new channel or optimize an existing one, you can come back to explore your options and gradually expand your digital marketing toolkit.

By Nouman Yaqoob | January 3, 2026 | Reader Disclosure I know how stressful it is to watch the news about AI and wonder if your website will survive. That’s why choosing the right SEO plugin for the AI search era can feel like a high-stakes decision for your business. I’ve spent months testing Rank Math vs. All in One SEO to see which one actually keeps your traffic safe. You need a tool that handles the technical heavy lifting so you can focus on your work. In this review, I’ll share my personal experience using both tools on real websites. I found that one of these plugins is far better at preparing your site for the future of AI. I want to help you feel confident that you aren’t just guessing with your SEO. My goal is to show you which choice will grow with your business without causing technical headaches. If you are looking for the best SEO plugin to future-proof your site for the AI search era, All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is the winner. While Rank Math offers great tools for manual optimization, AIOSEO provides the specific technical infrastructure needed for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Before we dive into the in-depth comparison, here is my quick overview: Since 2009, WPBeginner has been helping millions of WordPress users build and grow their websites. We’ve used and worked with SEO plugins daily in real-world scenarios to grow our own businesses. For this comparison, we used the premium versions of both All in One SEO and Rank Math in live testing environments to evaluate every feature, technical setting, and AI integration they offer. For more information about how we evaluate WordPress tools, see our editorial guidelines. I have broken down this comparison into the following key sections: Setting up an SEO plugin should be straightforward. You want a tool that configures the basics correctly without asking a hundred confusing questions. AIOSEO uses a very friendly step-by-step setup wizard. The first thing you notice upon plugin activation is how it immediately launches a “Let’s Get Started” screen that feels very welcoming. It will then ask for your website category. You can pick if your site is a blog, news site, online store, or small business. I found this helpful because it tailors the settings for you. I really like the “Person or Organization” step. This is where you add your logo and social profile URLs. Google uses this data for its Knowledge Panel, and AIOSEO makes it simple to fill out. The wizard also handles advanced technical SEO settings for you behind the scenes. You can still tweak those settings if you want, but the wizard gives you an optimal starting point. If you want to follow along, we have a detailed guide for AIOSEO that walks you through every single step. I found that most users can finish the entire process in less than 5 minutes. Rank Math also has a setup wizard, but it feels a bit different. When I activated it, the first thing I saw was a prompt to connect a Rank Math account. I found this a bit frustrating because I had to create yet another account just to use the plugin. You can skip it, but you lose access to some of the best features. Once inside, you have to choose between Easy, Advanced, or Custom modes. I noticed that many beginners choose “Easy,” but then they miss out on the advanced schema tools later. I was impressed by the compatibility check. It scans your site for conflicting plugins before you start. This prevented a lot of technical headaches for me during my testing. I found the Rank Math wizard to be very detailed. It covers everything from Sitemap configuration to Role Manager. However, it feels more like sitting in the cockpit of a plane with many toggles and switches. I recommend All in One SEO for this category. It follows the “Set and Forget” philosophy that is so important for busy business owners. It makes smart decisions for you right out of the box. Rank Math is excellent if you love to “tinker” with every small detail. But for a clean and fast setup, AIOSEO is the clear winner for beginners. I found that a smooth setup sets the stage for everything else. Now that we have the foundations ready, let’s look at how these tools help you with your daily SEO work. Most of your time won’t be spent in the plugin settings. It will be spent inside the WordPress block editor, writing content, creating pages, and managing your business. I wanted to see which tool actually helps you write better and more SEO-friendly. In other words, which plugin offers a better on-page SEO experience for users? The following table compares the on-page SEO features available directly within the WordPress editor for both plugins. This comparison highlights how each tool helps your team during the actual content creation process. Now, I’ll walk you through my experience with each of the plugins. When you write a post with AIOSEO, you get a TruSEO score in the top right corner. I found this incredibly motivating. It isn’t just a number. Instead, it’s a smart checklist of over 70 different SEO factors. I really like the General tab. It breaks your post down into “Basic SEO,” “Title,” and “Readability.” For example, if your paragraphs are too long, AIOSEO will highlight them in orange and tell you exactly how to fix them. It feels like having a professional editor looking over your shoulder. Another feature that stands out is the Headline Analyzer. Before I publish, I always check my title score. It looks for “Power Words” and “Emotional Words” that encourage people to click. I managed to increase the click-through rate on my latest tutorial just by following the suggestion to add an “action” word to my title. Another bonus tool worth mentioning is SEOBoost. It is a powerful AI Writing Assistant that offers real-time SEO guidance within the WordPress editor. Get keyword suggestions, readability checks, competitor insights, and more – all in one place. The downside is that it requires a paid SEOBoost subscription (Starting from $22.50). Apart from the usual Focus Keyword, Title, and Meta Description optimization, AIOSEO comes with full support for schema markup with built-in blocks for several popular content types like recipes, products, FAQs, table of contents, and more. Rank Math takes a similar but slightly different approach. The free version allows you to track up to 5 focus keywords, which is very generous. I found this helpful when I wanted to rank for a main topic and a few related sub-topics at the same time. They also have a feature called Content AI. This uses artificial intelligence to scan the web and tell you exactly how many words, headings, and images you should use to beat the top-ranking sites. It gives you a “target” to hit, which is great for competitive niches. However, I noticed that Rank Math’s editor can feel a bit “busy.” There are a lot of numbers and suggestions flying at you at once. If you are a minimalist writer, you might find the AIOSEO interface a bit more peaceful and easier to navigate. You want your posts to look great when they are shared on Facebook or X (Twitter). Both plugins have a “Social” tab, but I found AIOSEO’s preview to be more accurate. In AIOSEO, you can choose which specific image from your post to display as the “Social Image.” This is a lifesaver if your featured image doesn’t quite fit the square Facebook layout. Rank Math also offers this, but I found the “Overlay” icons in Rank Math to be a bit much for most professional business sites. AIOSEO is better for writers who want clear, actionable advice on making their content more readable and clickable. On the other hand, Rank Math is better for SEO pros who want to “over-optimize” for multiple keywords and use AI to research their competition. Writing great content is only half the battle. In 2026, you also have to make sure the “robots” and AI Crawlers can read your site properly. The rules of SEO have changed. It isn’t just about showing up in a list of blue links on Google anymore. Google’s new AI Search and other AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity are answering the users directly without them ever visiting your website. These are called zero-click searches. The strategy to survive in this landscape is called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Just like traditional SEO, GEO helps you position your brand to appear in AI answers, cited as sources, and mentioned as the authority. I tested both plugins to see which one helps you survive this shift. The folks at All in One SEO are incredibly fast at adapting to the new AI search era. Here are some of the features they have recently added to give users the cutting-edge advantage: 1. AI Keyword Report: Tracking “Ghost Queries” AIOSEO includes a brand-new AI Keyword Report that I find revolutionary. This tool shows you if ChatGPT or Gemini is actually citing your brand. I discovered what AIOSEO calls “Ghost Queries.” These are terms where I rank #1 on Google, but AI search engines completely ignore me. AIOSEO helps me find these gaps so I can fix my content for AI platforms. Related: See my tips on getting your content cited by AI Tools 2. Controlling the AI Crawl (llms.txt) AI models need to “read” your site efficiently. AIOSEO makes it super easy to create an llms.txt file automatically. It goes a step further with llms-full.txt. This automatically translates your content into “Markdown,” a clean text format that is much easier for AI robots to read and understand than standard HTML code. 3. AI Content and Image Generation All in One SEO comes with built-in AI content generation. Simply describe your content, and it will take care of the rest. This helps you write 10x faster and without leaving the WordPress dashboard. It goes beyond text and has an integrated AI Image Generator. Simply add an image block to your content and click on the ‘Generate with AI’ button. Then describe the image you want to add, and it will generate it for you. Rank Math takes a different approach. While AIOSEO focuses on helping you rank in AI results, Rank Math focuses heavily on helping you write content using AI. Here is how their tools stack up for the AI era: 1. AI Search Traffic (Tracking Clicks, Not Rankings) Rank Math introduced a feature called AI Search Traffic. It connects to your Google Search Console and analytics and filters the data to show you how many visitors came from AI tools like ChatGPT. While useful, this is a “rear-view mirror” tool. It only tells you about the success you already had (the people who clicked). It stays completely blind to “zero-click” citations—where ChatGPT gives your answer, but the user never visits your site. 2. Content AI (Writing Assistant) This is Rank Math’s biggest AI feature. It is a suite of 40+ AI writing templates built into your dashboard. You can use it to write blog post outlines, fix grammar, or generate social media captions. It uses a credit system (you have to buy credits) to run. Overall, it helps you produce content faster, but it doesn’t necessarily help that content rank better in AI search engines. 3. Basic llms.txt Support Like AIOSEO, Rank Math allows you to create an llms.txt file to help AI bots find your links. However, it currently lacks the advanced llms-full.txt feature with Markdown conversion. It points the bots to your pages, but it doesn’t translate the content into the “robot-friendly” language that AIOSEO does. Rank Math has excellent writing tools, but there are plenty of free tools (like ChatGPT itself) that can do that. All in One SEO is the clear winner here because it provides infrastructure. Its AI Keyword Report and llms-full.txt features give you a technical advantage that actually helps you rank in the new world of AI Search. Rank Math helps you write, but AIOSEO helps you win. Technical SEO is like the “plumbing” of your site’s SEO structure. If the pipes are broken, then search engines and AI agents cannot crawl or index your content effectively. For businesses, having an SEO plugin that automates complex technical tasks makes a big impact. For instance, fixing broken links or finding “orphaned content” manually can be time-consuming. You need a tool that handles this in minutes so you can prevent costly errors and save your team’s time. AIOSEO focuses heavily on automation and efficiency. My favorite feature here is the Link Assistant, which is a powerful internal linking tool integrated into your WordPress dashboard. It automatically scans your entire site to find “Orphan Pages”. These are high-quality posts that have no internal links pointing to them. The real game-changer is the “One-Click Insertion” dashboard. You can add internal links to your posts directly from the Link Assistant report without ever opening the WordPress editor. I estimate this saves about 40 to 50 hours of manual labor during a standard site audit. On the infrastructure side, AIOSEO’s Redirection Manager is built for speed. It allows you to export redirects to server-level files (.htaccess or nginx). This makes your redirects lightning-fast because they process before WordPress or the database even loads. Its modern architecture uses separate database tables to keep your site fast as your business grows. Rank Math offers a powerful set of technical tools, but the workflow often requires much more manual effort. For internal linking, it provides suggestions in a sidebar while you are writing. However, you still have to manually copy the suggested link and paste it into your text yourself. While Rank Math includes a Redirection Manager, it mostly relies on PHP-based redirection. This method is technically slower than AIOSEO’s server-level approach because the server must load the WordPress core before the redirect can execute. Under heavy traffic, this can cause “Time to First Byte” lag. Additionally, Rank Math is sometimes criticized in technical circles for “feature bloat.” Its feature-jamming approach can leave a larger footprint in your database, even if you disable certain modules. All in One SEO is the clear winner for technical SEO. While both plugins offer similar features on paper, AIOSEO automates the actual execution of these tasks. The ability to inject internal links with one click and handle redirects at the server level provides a better Return on Investment (ROI) by saving you significant time and keeping your site fast. For a business, the user interface is not just about looks. It directly impacts how much work you and your team get done. A “bloated” plugin can clutter your dashboard and make it harder for you to find things. AIOSEO follows a distinct design philosophy: “Decisions, not Options.” This means the plugin is designed to be clean, professional, and less intrusive. I like that its onboarding wizard uses plain-English questions to configure technical settings in the background. This allows you to set up your SEO in minutes rather than spending time searching Google to understand what everything means. From a technical standpoint, AIOSEO is built for speed and stability. Following a complete code refactoring, the plugin uses separate database tables for its data. This ensures that even as your site grows from a few dozen pages to over 100,000, the SEO plugin never becomes a performance bottleneck or slows down your WordPress admin dashboard. I also like AIOSEO’s design aesthetics with readable typography, plenty of spacing, and clear navigation. Rank Math is frequently criticized for “feature creep” or “bloat.” While it uses a modular design, code analysis suggests that even disabled modules can leave behind extra database tables and options that hurt performance. I noticed that Rank Math’s dashboard can feel quite busy, making it harder for non-technical users to find what they need. Plus, many users have reported frustration with Rank Math’s intrusive marketing. The dashboard often displays banners for credit upsells, and a “Write with AI” button frequently appears in the content editor. For professional writers, this can be visual clutter and a distraction. Its interface is often described as overwhelming due to the sheer volume of buttons and settings. The user interface uses a smaller font and buttons, which makes the design and navigation feel overwhelming at times. All in One SEO is the superior choice for user experience. It provides a cleaner, faster, and more professional environment. By focusing on “Decisions, not Options” and maintaining a database architecture that prevents site slowdowns, AIOSEO is an enterprise-grade tool that respects both your time and your website’s performance. On the other hand, Rank Math feels like a desk covered in post-it notes, advertisements, and gadgets you didn’t ask for. It’s functional but distracting. Depending on your business, you may need specialized SEO features that are critical for your business. For instance, retail businesses need local SEO to appear in the search results in their target area and region. Similarly, an eCommerce store needs product optimization to appear in shopping results. AIOSEO offers a comprehensive, wizard-driven Local SEO module that simplifies complex tasks. Setting up a Google My Business profile is super easy, including Google Maps integration. It also includes a functional Store Locator block and an automated Opening Hours Schema that handles holidays and special exceptions. This ensures that Google always knows exactly when your doors are open. For eCommerce, AIOSEO’s WooCommerce integration is excellent. It automatically populates product schema, such as price and availability, so your listings look professional in search results. Not using a shopping cart plugin? No worries, you can add a product block to display and sell products anywhere on your site (compatible with popular payment plugins like WP Simple Pay). Another standout feature is its “expired product” logic in the Redirection Manager. When a product is discontinued, you can set up an automatic redirect to a parent category to avoid a 404 error. This preserves your hard-earned “link juice” and keeps customers on your site. Additionally, its AI Image Generator lets you turn generic supplier photos into unique visual assets, which helps you avoid “duplicate content” penalties in image search. Rank Math provides multi-location support and local business schema, but I found the configuration to be complex and less intuitive for non-technical users. It lets you set up a Google My Business profile by adding supported data. While it includes a Schema Generator for products, it lacks the specialized “expired product” redirection logic found in AIOSEO. This means you have to manage discontinued products manually or risk losing search rankings. All in One SEO is the winner here. Its automated handling of expired products and the ability to generate unique product images with AI give eCommerce sites a massive competitive edge. Meanwhile, its Local SEO wizard makes “Map Pack” optimization accessible to every business owner. For agencies and growing teams, Security and Access Control are non-negotiable. Without granular permissions, a junior editor could accidentally “nuke” a site’s global schema or sitemap settings. This can lead to a catastrophic drop in search rankings that could take months to fix. AIOSEO is often called the “Enterprise Choice” because of its powerful security standards. It provides a Granular Role Manager that lets you let staff optimize meta tags while strictly restricting access to global infrastructure, such as redirects or sitemaps. This “Decisions, not Options” philosophy ensures that the interface remains clean and safe for your clients. I’ve found that this level of control is a lifesaver for agency owners who want to prevent human error. Rank Math includes a role manager, but it has been reported as less intuitive and occasionally buggy, particularly in WordPress multisite environments. The user experience is also hurt by “feature creep.” For example, frequent dashboard ads for credit upsells and “Write with AI” buttons appearing directly inside content editor fields create a lot of visual noise. This cluttered environment increases the risk of accidental configuration errors by less experienced users who might get distracted by the gadgets and ads. All in One SEO wins for its professional, “clean” environment. Its focus on stability and restrictive access protects business owners from mistakes. This makes it the safer and more reliable choice for anyone managing a professional team or multiple client sites. You want to know that help is there when you need it. I’ve dealt with support teams for both companies. AIOSEO is part of the Awesome Motive family. They have a massive team that also supports plugins like WPForms and MonsterInsights. I found their documentation to be written in plain English. It is very easy for a beginner to follow their step-by-step tutorials. Rank Math also has a great community and a 24/7 forum. I liked their AI support bot, which offered quick answers to common questions. However, I found their replies can sometimes be a bit technical for a non-coder. Winner: Tie Both plugins have excellent documentation and quick support channels to get help. The common myth is that Rank Math is cheaper. When I looked at the 2026 pricing, I found the “Agency Tier” story is very different. I believe AIOSEO Elite offers the best value for agencies. It includes the AI Keyword Report and advanced client management for a much lower price than Rank Math’s top tier. AI Credits Pricing All in One SEO’s included AI credits are quite enough for most small businesses and blogs. You only need to pay if you have used up all your AI monthly credits and need to replenish them. Rank Math’s yearly plans don’t have a pay-as-you-go option. You get a set amount of credits each month, and if you have consumed them, you have to upgrade to a higher annual plan. Winner: All in One SEO Choosing the right SEO plugin is about future-proofing your business. Here is my final verdict. I recommend All in One SEO (AIOSEO) for business owners and agencies. It is the only WordPress SEO plugin that helps you gain visibility into AI search results. The Link Assistant and AI Keyword Report provide a massive Return on Investment. It saves you time and shows you data that Rank Math simply doesn’t have. I recommend Rank Math for hobbyists and smaller blogs or portfolio sites. It is a great tool if you enjoy micro-managing every single technical toggle. But for now, AIOSEO has captured the high ground. It is the smarter, more stable choice for the AI search era. In the rapidly changing world of AI search, you likely have specific concerns about how these tools impact your site’s performance and workflow. Here are my answers to those questions: Will I lose my current search rankings if I switch from Rank Math to AIOSEO? No, switching plugins does not hurt your rankings if done correctly. All in One SEO includes a built-in Setup Wizard that can import all your titles, descriptions, and schema settings from Rank Math in one click. This ensures a seamless transition without losing your SEO progress. Does AIOSEO’s content analysis work with page builders like Elementor or Divi? Yes, both plugins have deep integrations with popular page builders. In 2026, you can access the TruSEO score and AI insights directly within the Elementor or Divi editor sidebars, allowing you to optimize your design and content simultaneously. Do I need to buy my own OpenAI API key to use the AI features? No, you do not need a separate API key. Both plugins use their own secure connections to provide AI features. AIOSEO includes a generous amount of monthly credits with its plans, whereas Rank Math requires a separate recurring subscription for its Content AI tools. What is the benefit of the llms-full.txt file found in AIOSEO? The standard llms.txt is just a list of links, but llms-full.txt provides the actual content of your pages in a clean Markdown format. This is critical because it allows AI agents like ChatGPT and Claude to “ingest” your content much more accurately, increasing your chances of being cited as a source. Is Rank Math still the best free option for hobbyists? Rank Math remains a popular choice for users who want a lot of technical toggles for free. However, for business owners who need “Generative Engine Optimization” (GEO) features like AI Keyword tracking, the premium versions of AIOSEO have become the industry standard in 2026. Can I use both plugins at the same time? No, you should never run two SEO plugins simultaneously. This causes technical conflicts, slows down your site, and confuses search engine crawlers. It is best to choose one plugin that fits your business goals and stick with it.

Business LONDON/NEW YORK, ‌Jan 5 : Global stock markets, riding high on AI euphoria at the start of 2026 may be disregarding one of the biggest threats that could spoil the party: a surge in inflation driven partly by the tech investment boom. U.S. stock indexes, where seven tech groups contributed half of all market earnings this year, made double-digit gains in 2025 to hit record highs as exuberance about AI and monetary easing also propelled European and Asian equities to record peaks. Expectations for further rate cuts have buoyed bonds too, handing U.S. Treasury investors the best annual performance for five years as inflation retreated, although it remains above the Federal Reserve's average 2 per cent target. For 2026, waves of government stimulus in the U.S., Europe and Japan as well as the AI boom are expected to refuel global growth.

"You need a pin that pricks the bubble and it will probably ‌come through tighter money," said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management. He said that while he was holding on to big tech stocks for now he would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026. Tighter money would reduce investors' appetite for speculative tech, raise funding costs for AI projects and reduce tech groups' profits and share prices, Greetham said.The multi-trillion-dollar race by so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres was also an inflationary force, analysts said, because of the rate at which these projects are gobbling up energy and advanced chips."The costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs," Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets said.He said U.S. consumer price inflation would ‍stay above the Federal Reserve's 2 per cent target until the end of 2027 in part because of heavy corporate investment in AI.J.P.

Title: Is the AI boom a bubble waiting to pop? Here’s what history says

As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst. The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history. The S&P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the circular nature of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants. Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different. “At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?” Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles. One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett. By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gaining 130%. While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said. The S&P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who said in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks. Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said. Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins. “It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said. But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago. The potential for credit risk in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by Societe Generale. The S&P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, Cisco Systems Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today. Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said. Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade. This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises. “I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.”

Title: Xreal releases new AR glasses and power hub to transform work and entertainment

UPDATED 09:00 EST / JANUARY 04 2026 by Kyt Dotson Augmented reality device maker Xreal Inc. released the Xreal 1S today, a new premium pair of 3D spatial display glasses, and a compact power hub that combines a battery and video passthrough. The 1S joins the Xreal One Series, including the One and One Pro, providing a powerful foundation for wearable AR displays. The company said the 1S represents a new standard for AR displays and is a market replacement for the initial Xreal One, released in December 2024. 1S provides an immersive, cinema-grade experience with the ability to project a 171-inch spatial screen while building on core aspects of the One. It increases resolution from 1080p to 1200p FullHD, delivers brightness of 700 nits, and offers a larger field of view at 52 degrees. When moving between outdoors and indoors, the glasses can change their display settings using electrochromic dimming to adapt to lighting conditions. The glasses also feature Sound by Bose technology, eliminating the need for earbuds or headphones, and are capable of delivering high-fidelity audio directly near the ears. All of this is built into a lightweight 82-gram frame. Although this is heavier than the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which weigh 49-51 grams, the S1 packs in numerous productivity and entertainment features. The Ray-Ban smart glasses also only project onto one lens, so they do not provide a 3D augmented reality display like the S1. For comparison, some regular sunglasses weigh about 45 grams, making these glasses feel heavier on the face. Users can place floating screens in their vision that “anchor in place” and do not move when they move their head, or they can generate an ultra-large cinema screen that will stay in front of their vision at all times. For productivity, “side view” allows pinning a smaller screen to a corner of vision, such as the top-right or bottom-right, allowing users to multitask by watching content while seeing the real-world surroundings clearly. Available today, the Xreal 1S lowers the price from its predecessor, the Xreal One, from $499 to $449. That makes it more affordable for entry-level consumers. “Every Xreal One Series product has raised the bar for what wearable displays can achieve,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Chi Xu. “With Xreal 1S, we’re not only lowering the cost of entry, we’re doing so while boosting specs and performance, and improving optics.” In addition to the 1S, Xreal launched a power accessory called Neo, providing extended battery life for longer sessions. The Neo serves as a DisplayPort video hub with a 10,000 mAh power bank, eliminating the need for additional adapters or chargers. It supports 30-watt input and 20-watt output on battery and up to 45-watt output when connected to a wall charger. Beyond battery life, the Neo permits higher video performance gains when streaming from other devices. It also unlocks the ability to connect to the Nintendo Switch handheld, without the need for the previously required dock. Xreal 1S users can experience the Nintendo Inc. Switch’s onboard screen at 1080p resolutions. Valve Corp. SteamDeck owners can receive up to 1200p resolution. “Xreal 1S brings true cinema-quality spatial displays to more people than ever before, while Xreal Neo redefines what’s possible in portable AR by solving one of the industry’s biggest limitations – power and performance on the go,” said Xu.

I was about to write the similar comment. I had to click just to see what this is about. Since the clickbait worked, maybe it will start some garbled title trend. Boy Howdy! That’s 4 minutes of my life completely shot to hell… I don’t understand why UnHerd asked a Columbia University student to write a column. Pretty sure the pandas are AI. Here are some photos of real bears from National Geographic: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/giant-baby-panda-cubs-china-conservation I immediately had the same impression — AI-generated, or CGI. The page where this image originates is full of similarly-themed and obviously CGI/AI generated pictures, and the site hosting it, stockcake.com, touts “Millions of free AI stock photos”, and “Sign up to use AI-powered tools — Join 300,000+ creators • Free forever • No credit card required”. That term ‘creators’ is a bit of a stretch. All they did was to take other people’s work and used a computer to bodgy up their own version which puts the real, original creators out of work. And people wonder why I despise Silicon Valley culture. The hosting site is totally open about it. Witness: “Recreate this image — Sign up to generate variations — 50 free credits daily — Commercial license included — No credit card required” Respectively: “Apply stunning effects — Sign up to use AI tools on this image…” The well of artistic creation is truly and hopelessly poisoned. A post by a sort-of respected medical researcher on twitter had an AI-generated image and someone replied that it would be better to not use this stuff. The researcher (what a nerve) told the replier to make an image for him if they didn’t like the AI. Someone else replied “f off with your anti-AI propaganda”. Anti-AI propaganda? Where are people’s heads at, my god. Makes me wonder if the reply was generated by… wait for it….. an LLM AI Bot? I replaced the AI panda image with a real panda trio. Some pictures are too good to be true. The new photo is great, thanks. It’s a bear band lp cover photo. I think they play bluegrass. Thanks Haig. Much more pleasing to the eye <3 i watch broadcast TV via youtube. My suspicion is that 33 – 49% of youtube adverts are made via generative AI. Hollywood and NYC national broadcasters, as we know it, are dead men walking The handwriting has been on the wall since Max Headroom. “Live updates: Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela after Maduro capture” That’s going to be a neat trick. Does he plan on phoning in his orders? Will he send Venezuelan-Americans back in to run the country for him without the need for a messy election? Can’t be done without boots on the ground but is there an appetite to do so? Mark Sleboda on Danny Haiphong yesterday opined to the contrary, that the absence of defensive fire against dozens of helicopters and the orderly handover of Maduro by his guards to the Americans means the military was bought off in advance and in on the plot. He thinks there will be no problem maintaining order in the near term with threats and bribes. Haiphong also said the house of the defense minsiter was hit but he survived becuase he got to his bunker. The US took out a lot of the lights in Caracas before they went in and also hit airbases to take out air defenses. MANPADs require either initial visual targeting (the IR can then take over) or radar, so no lights would impede MANPAD use. More from the Financial Times: Experts in air assault said that the US air armada would have been able to suppress Venezuelan airspace defences using a variety of electronic and kinetic attacks, from spoofing GPS timing and jamming communications to turning off early warning and targeting radar. This meant that the Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters seen flying low over the skyline of Caracas were “in little danger until they reached the fortress”, said Andrew Turner, a former Royal Air Force helicopter pilot. “The ingress and egress from the Iwo Jima to the target would have been the easy part,” said Turner. “The most dangerous time is the 60-90 seconds as you are approaching and are on the target when you don’t have the full picture, bullets are going everywhere and you have yet to secure the area. That is where the danger is.” And Kutilya the Contemplator: It must be noted here that the fact that US helicopters entered Caracas, seized Maduro and exited without any significant resistance does not demonstrate Venezuelan military acquiescence or institutional weakness. It more plausibly reflects temporary denial of response at the apex of command – confusion, withheld authorization, selective stand-downs by a narrow set of gatekeepers or deliberate restraint to avoid catastrophic escalation against overwhelming US force. Modern, politicized militaries do not automatically fire under conditions of uncertainty. They calculate institutional survival. Thus, if inducements or coercion occurred, they needed only to neutralize air-defense commanders and presidential guard leadership, not the entire force. A clean extraction therefore signals elite fracture and risk aversion in the moment, not acceptance of foreign custodianship. Indeed, militaries humiliated without being destroyed often shift toward delayed, asymmetric and deniable resistance, making the absence of immediate kinetic response a warning sign rather than reassurance for Washington. https://chandragupta.substack.com/p/decapitation-without-destruction So this is not proven. People want tidy explanations when a lot is still not very well known. Yes. To be honest, this is what I would have expected from a military without recent combat experience, subject to an attack that was a complete tactical surprise, carefully prepared and with an overwhelming capability advantage. Against a large-scale conventional attack, they would probably have done quite a lot better, because they would have had more time, but you have to anticipate, plan for and train for a limited and targeted attack of this kind, which it’s clear the Venezuelans were not expecting. Any such attack achieves most of its effect from surprise and it seems surprise here was total. That said, it’s not clear to me that the US has gained a great deal except in PR terms. There is no reason to suppose that the new government (same as the old government, effectively) will do what the US wants, nor that the US is prepared to actually try to invade the country. to make it do so. I’ve been reading that Maduro was guarded by Wagner mercenaries, which makes me wonder. This would be a stain on their record if they got rolled with barely landing any punches of their own. I suspect they just provided his personal protection against assassinations, conventional kidnapping attempts etc: things like vehicle escort, manning security barriers, and the like.They would not have been expecting something like this, nor equipped to deal with it. Venezuela was up against the might of the western colonial empire. And in the fine British tradition of never believe anything until it has been officially denied, I would say the UK was definitely involved “British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country was not involved in the United States’ strikes on Venezuela” from Al-Jazeera. So this was probably US muscle + UK colonial rule tactics + Israeli electronic warfare. The US attack was not a bolt from the blue. Venezuela had been facing an obvious enemy buildup on their doorstep for many weeks. Everybody knows that “decapitation” is part of US and Israeli doctrine–virtually SOP. In any case, enemy attack on one’s command-and-control is always to be expected in war. Recent examples: Israelis killing Nasrallah. Russian SF tried to nab Zelensky at the beginning of the Ukraine war. Even if we disregard the risk of capture, Maduro should still have already been in a HQ bunker, or making frequent moves, simply because of the risk of an air strike, made by an enemy known to have stealth aircraft and advanced ECM. Now think about just how good the US intelligence had to be, to conduct the kidnap–how accurate, how timely the information they needed. On this basis alone, treachery would be a reasonable hypothesis. From the videos I’ve seen, some helicopters were plainly visible. Fair targets for old fashioned ack-ack, let alone MANPADS. Whatever details emerge, I assume Venezuela will take this as a wake up call, time to diversify small arms storage. The Grayzone podcast yesterday by Max Blumenthal and Anya Parampil was interesting on this issue. Both are very familiar with the Venezuela situation and have relevant contacts there and in DC. While they were careful in their comments, they strongly implied that there had been negotiations behind the scenes in the preceding weeks toward just this outcome. They didn’t say it quite this directly, but my interpretation was that Maduro was given the choice to leave voluntarily and would not, so the “choice” was made for him (actually Parampil did state this as a possible scenario). They did not directly accuse Delcy Rodríguez or others in Maduro’s administration of complicity, but they did point out that for some reason the Trump administration seems willing to deal with them, at least temporarily, and noted Trump’s rather brutal dismissal of Machado in his press conference. And while they kind of danced around this, they did raise questions about the relative ease with which the kidnapping took place. For those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTgkGSeJfhg Fwiw, there is something analogous between MAGAism and Bolivarianismo, in the sense of riling up disaffected masses against established elites. However, I doubt socio-cultural affinity probably doesn’t mean much to Trump (I personally thought Maduro was more a “jobber” than a real believer, which Rodriguez seemed to be–then again, that’d make her more like MTG whom Trumpuro hates…) I suspect that the reason that Trump dissed Machao was because she “took” his Nobel Peace Prize when clearly it should have belonged to him. From A Martyanov: “I know, it is going to be hurtful to many but they don’t call those countries banana republics for nothing, banana republic being a euphemism for corrupt regimes and toy armies. Some news (from there)–the chief of Maduro’s security detail as well as a number of others have been bought by the US. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you.” Polar Scientist was commenting yesterday that there was fire exchange and that US group left under fire. if wagner were anywhere near this fight you know we’d be seeing pix on US .mil social media of some roided-out JSOC beardo showing off his RUS ghanima. they either never existed or weren’t trusted by maduro not to be bought off (never trust a merc with your life) And another question: will the billion dollar a day fleet off the Venezuelan coast now go home? As to the question of whether Trump knows what he is doing we all know the answer. Antiwar site says that 40 people were killed from the raid’s bombing and some American troops may have been injured. MOA says among the bomb targets was Chavez’ mausoleum. Classy. At any rate the attack’s true purpose–throw a small country against the wall to show who’s boss– has likely been accomplished. That this brilliant idea never seems to work will be ignored by Trump as he builds his arch of triumph to himself in DC. No doubt it will include a bas relief of Maduro in handcuffs. I just saw Douglas Macgregor on Judge Napolitano. He thinks not, or at least not all of them. The US has ~15,000 tropps which he thinks will be committed, as Trump indicated (he talked about boots on the ground), presumably to do things like secure key government installations and protect oil assets. They will require logistical support. If Trump tries, those troops will be stretched thin. The accepted ration for an occupation is twenty troops for every 1,000 population. And Venezuela has a population of about 30 million. So will there be a Green Zone in Caracas then? I suspect, admittedly on very limited information, that if President Trump is foolish enough to send in only the 15,000, that they believe their own propaganda and/or that they have a deal with what they believe are the current ruling Venezuela elites. Kidnapping a country’s leader especially without a declaration of war under criminal charges that the attacking country’s leader could be indicted under seems like a good way to guarantee a hot war; there are always some angry men willing to take revenge. Getting troops in isn’t difficult compared to getting them out. Trump says US will ‘ruin’ Venezuela after Maduro capture”.

BTW, I blew it— those C F R links were January 2026. I am not with the New Year date. Interesting bit on Rodriguez from the AP: Strong ties with Wall Street A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodríguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. She and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro. Unlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. Among her past interlocutors were Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela. Fluent in English, Rodríguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated, market-friendly moderate in contrast to the military hard-liners who took up arms with Chávez against Venezuela’s democratically elected president in the 1990s. https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-trump-maduro-military-rodriguez-lead-c0bd39f98a79c18c5501bac939c640fe# “Trump admin sends tough private message to oil companies on Venezuela” I can understand the reluctance of the oil companies. Trump is expecting them to invest huge amounts of capital to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure as well as starting to convert plants in the US to once more handle the heavy crudes that they use to process. And this effort will effort will take many years and is assuming that there is no resistance in Venezuela to them pumping that oil to send to the US while paying Venezuela only a pittance. Say that it will take five years which may prove optimistic. What will this country be like by 2031? Which party will be running the US by then? Why is Trump not offering any guarantees but lumbering all the costs onto them? If I was running an oil company, I would be extremely lurky about getting too much involved and spending too much capital on such a dynamic situation. I certainly be not depending on a Trump promise. What a framing but, I think Trump is offering protection money/troops/mercs to the oil companies and a reimbusement to big oil investments through these government supports. Sort of like the old protection rackets — I am offering protection in exchange for some money…wouldn’t want anything bad to happen..if you know what I mean. the below quote could be used about Gaza and Venezuela “Venezuela would be a crown jewel if the above-ground risk is removed. I have companies saying let’s see where this lands,” said Derentz “above-ground risk is removed” pesky humans That kinda sounds like he wants to establish a “security zone” around those oil fields where there will be no people, towns or villages allowed. Kinda like the Israeli method. No doubt they will get some merc corporations to provide all the security in and around there with drones being used as well. Oil field workers may be forced to live in some sort of policed towns in this security zone and only allowed out on weekend leave or the like. If this is so, then they must be really worried about sabotage there. So would I. Well one thing we know for sure, whatever policy put in place by Trump-as it pertains to Venezuela-will be left as is should a Dem administration take over in 2028. Iraq being the Cheney Oily-Man symposium on , “We used to, and that’s why we don’t any more…” Also, given the global trend favoring renewables over fossil fuels as evidenced by shifting market shares (Our World in Data) favoring the former, this might give oil companies pause when it comes to costly, long term investments, and particularly so if the locals are hostile. ‘Science girl @sciencegirl A Shaolin kung fu master shows how it’s done.’ If it weren’t for the clothes that they were wearing, somebody should have told them to put their rulers away and zip up again. I have been staring at this comment for 5 minutes and I absolutely cannot figure out what idea you are trying to convey, rev. Is it obscure aussie slang or something? A measuring contest. The ruler is for measuring the size of their respective “members”. Maine company’s hoodie worn by captured Venezuelan leader Maduro, WMTW. The photo is interesting and I’m curious what other readers think. Madero is shown with hands cuffed in front giving two thumbs up while surrounded by DEA agents. That is an interesting photo that. Those DEA agents tried to make it a ‘trophy’ shot but Maduro giving both thumbs up spoiled the whole thing for them. Maduro was previously negotiating. Here are some what-ifs. He wanted safe passage to pick-a-country. He got some assurances about personal safety for his family. The next shoe to drop will be revelations about the Venezuelan role in election machines. They do have form. >The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife In his appeal, Noriega argued that his arrest violated international law under the head-of-state immunity doctrine. The district court rejected Noriega’s head-of-state immunity claim because the United States government never recognized Noriega as Panama’s legitimate ruler — an argument that will be made in the Maduro prosecution. Can China lawfully detain and try Taiwan’s president under Chinese law just because it doesn’t recognize his legitimacy? Seems to me that the arrest of a Taiwanese president under PRC law could be much easier argued as legal given that Taiwan is not actually officially recognized as an independent nation by the vast majority of the world. Netanyahu is an international criminal guilty of plausible genocide by the ICJ. Were he kidnapped and brought to the Hague, and imprisoned, or kidnapped by another country to stand trial, I doubt the US would tolerate it. As for Noriega, unlike Maduro, Noriega was an unelected dictator. The US charges against Maduro include drug smuggling and dealing in weapons, and if he were a US President doing these things as part of his office (which we know many have done) — if I read the recent SCOTUS decision correctly — he would be immune from prosecution. A US president may be immune from a US prosecution, but he is now subject to jurisdiction from just about anyone in the world under their laws who care not one bit about SCOTUS. Top 5 African countries with the best quality of life index at the start of 2026 Business Insider Africa This made me think of Gaddafi. Maybe this index is how the great USA chooses the African country that needs destruction the most. Unlike Libya, none of the five countries mentioned are particularly resource-rich, and all depend partly on tourism. Libya is a good example of the old rule that you can only bribe the population with resource revenues, up to a certain point, no matter how repressive your security apparatus is. It’s a story that’s played out many times in Africa and the Middle East, and will again, no doubt. I thought that list was kind of odd. I’ve been to West Africa more than a handful of times for both work and visiting friends and Senegal, Ivory Coast and at the limit, Guinea-Bissau, are livable countries with tons of potential. I’ve also been to South Africa plenty – though not in the last 10 years – and while it has higher levels of economic development at the very top, it seemed to me not a place for the kind of people who can’t deal with constant situational awareness. Egypt is the real outlier there. The cities need a heck of a lot of infrastructure care. When I was studying the Maghrebi dialect of Arabic (spoken in Morocco), all my teachers told me the king (the current king’s father) was not well loved. Gaddafi is also a good example of the old rule that you can only remain in power so long as you don’t threaten the economies of larger countries’ economies, imo. See his interest in selling oil for currencies other than US dollars. I don’t think those who rose up against him in 2011 were particularly worried about that. Little brown people who don’t speak English have agency too, you know. In any case Gaddafi was very popular internationally after 2004 as an ally in the War on Terror without the tiresome scruples of western states, and it was only when he was clearly going down that the West piled in, hoping to be on good terms with whoever replaced him. The CIA and M-I6 are very very good at… um… ‘guiding’ the people and events in foreign countries. See: color revolutions. See Hillary “we came, we saw, he died” Clinton. / ;) Pretty sure those “little brown people who don’t speak English” did not, for example, bomb their own county’s irrigation infrastructure all by themselves and very likely did not wish it to happen – https://theecologist.org/2015/may/14/war-crime-nato-deliberately-destroyed-libyas-water-infrastructure It’s funny how self-destructive behavior of little non-white non-English-speaking people perfectly matches neocolonial desires of bigwig white English-speaking gentlemen, not to mention military efforts of NATO countries. The Lord indeed works in mysterious ways. He was by no means “clearly going down” until after the west piled on. – ‘The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife’ – Jonathan Turley I commented on this yesterday, but as I re-read this I find I’m much more irritated today. Turley lays out the defense he thinks Maduro will use based on the earlier Manuel Noriega case . He defends the “legality” of the Trump administration’s kidnapping though some dubious Obama whataboutism (which I guess is “precedent” here), and explains why Maduro’s defense will fail as did Noriega’s. As he notes, much of this earlier failure, in a “legal” sense, was simply due to the State’s insistence that Noriega was not a legitimate head of state, just a common drug trafficker. The Court just accepted this bulls**t claim. Turley has the audacity to pretend that the preordained verdict was a matter of law! But then he goes further and says this in his conclusion: “Legally, Trump has the upper hand in this case. Maduro will replay the arguments from the Noriega case. However, he presents an even weaker case on the merits under the controlling precedent than did Noriega.” Noriega was a notorious drug trafficker whose actions were abetted by the US when he was helping us support the Contras against Nicaragua. But he knew where a lot of skeletons were buried (figuratively and literally) and so was legally “disappeared” when he became a little too “independent.” Maduro’s case was *nothing* like this, and whatever corruption took place during his regime (and I’m sure it was there, so there will be “evidence” of some kind), these charges are ridiculously “trumped” up. Everyone knows this. For Turley to pretend that The Law matters at all here simply reinforces the despicable administration framing. A YouTuber (Judge Nap?) said the case was filed under Trump 1.0 but not pursued under Biden because they could not prove it. Turley ignores the factual allegations, that it depicts Maduro as the head of some named cartel (forgive me for not searching for it) which Larry Johnson has repeatedly dismissed as a fabrication. Turley, the very self righteous law “absolutist,” has a flexible view when the law is bent by Republicans. He seemed refreshing when we were suffering under Biden and the opposite now that the supposedly victimized conservatives are back in charge. Meanwhile Simplicus suggests that the entire operation was theater in which Maduro cooperated since a deal has been worked out for him and his family to take a plea or be let go–another way of making him disappear. This is mere speculation of course. So how long until we just dismiss Turley as a right-wing shill? wasn’t that about twenty years ago? If so, and regardless, a lot of people, “little people” for sure, were killed and injured in the process. The operation is despicable. Nothing more to add.

The strong will do as they will and the weak suffer what they must.* Overthrow the strong. *solidarity Instead: How do the many bring the clever onto their side? And then overthrow Capital Given the present trajectory, I expect Capital to “overthrow” itself. By focusing narrowly and almost exclusively on its own ‘private’ profit, Capital starves the public sector of resources with which to run, let alone expand social services. This directly effects the ability of “society” in general to support the Capitalist class in its endeavours. Late stage Capitalism can be best described as a Doom Loop in progress. What many “True Believers” forget is that Capitalism is a Teran human construct. It is not a “Natural Law,” or an aspect of physics. Terran humans being fallible beings, then so too are their creations. Capitalism may not think about the Jackpot, but the Jackpot thinks about Capitalism. I wonder who will be the Maduros’ lawyers. I would suggest the same team that represents Luigi Mangione. Turley disingenuously ignores the blatant illegality of the Maduro ‘arrest’ under international law. There is a critical distinction between “prescriptive”jurisdiction, under which a state may criminalize conduct outside its borders which has domestic effects, and “enforcement” jurisdiction, which forbids a state from exercising law enforcement actions (such as arrests) in the territory of another country without that country’s consent. That is the whole point of having extradition treaties. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 432(2) (sorry can’t link due to paywall); Ghappour, “Searching Places Unknown,” 69 Stanford Law Review 1075, 1100 (2017). 1. International law is irrelevant in US courts 2. Lawyers can correct me, but I also believe illegal arrests are not a defense to prosecution in the US either. If cops or prosecutors get information impermissibly (search w/o a warrant or consent, for instance), that information cannot be used in a prosecution. But my having watched too many vids by civil rights attorneys says you need to be found innocent of the criminal charges, and only then can you file a civil rights claim over the illegal arrest. With all due respect, I am a lawyer and a retired federal judge. Your statement that international law is irrelevant in federal courts is way too glib. True, the issue is complicated and has been the subject of intense debate since the 1990s, but there is little doubt that for most of our history the “Law of Nations” was regarded as part of the Supreme Law of the Land. https://tlblog.org/international-law-in-american-courts/ I offer no prediction on whether the illegality of the arrest will prove to be a get out of jail card for Maduro in this particular instance. I do know it is possible to challenge an illegal extradition by filing a federal habeas corpus petition. I handled several such cases when I was on the bench. secular americans, especially those in the industry, cling so tightly to “legality” as though there is some divine arbiter to whom the wronged could appeal. obviously this whole thing is an illegal farce, and equally obviously team snatch&grab doesn’t give a damn. if (mirabile dictu) he’s found innocent, will he be repatriated and reinstated? c’mon. several decades of abusing and neglecting the rule of law (under both parties) have rendered it a crumbling edifice at best and a transparent joke at worst.

As far as I know, that precedent still stands — and it was reaffirmed during Bush 2’s portion of the GWOT.

For many years now a lot of States require people that are employed by them to sign contracts which include the proviso that they are not allowed to do stuff like boycott Israel. I personally would say that this was in direct contravention of the US First Amendment but State and Federal governments – of both parties – were cool with it so what do I know. Thing is, with the Trump regime in charge right now, Trump might decide that this is a fine idea that would please his buddy Bibi and start doing it. I’ve always thought those laws and contracts are unenforceable. If you don’t broadcast your reasons, who’s going to know that you’re not buying Israeli goods? It’s like the claim from fundies that students aren’t allowed to pray in school. Didn’t The Teacher say you’re not supposed to pray in public like the hypocrites? If you pray silently to your god(s), who’s going to know? Re cars as spybots–lest readers get too panicky about this I believe even Teslas require owner consent (perhaps it’s an opt out) for the car to continuously phone home to mother via cell towers. On ICE cars like mine you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call for help in case of as accident or emergency. The linked article says that cell supplied navigation services–on that dash screen– also give the car company continuous access to the computer inside your car. However the car is still recording data even if offline so if you take it to the dealer for service (or if right to repair advocates have their way any repair shop) then the record of your travels can be recovered. So I use my own GPS navigator (not smartphone based), don’t subscribe to the manufacturer’s services and have yet to take it to the dealer since I change my own oil. Some among the paranoid even disable the “head unit”–that center dash box that contains the various radios–to make sure the car isn’t talking to the spooks but that’s probably going too far. Simply refusing to cooperate in your own privacy invasion is probably enough. Happy to be informed otherwise by those more in the know. you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call I don’t think that’s as strong an argument as you think it is. If you can subscribe, that means the capability to do whatever is still there in the background. The subscription only means you’re paying for them to provide a service. If you were to subscribe, chances are almost certain that you wouldn’t have to take it in to the dealer to ‘turn it on’…. that would cost too much for them and be a very big negative effect on conversion rates. The car is talking to home, just not telling you. Back in the summer of ‘21 I was advised by my Sudbury dealer that my brand new Impreza would constantly be collecting driving data. He told me that this data would be used in a court of law were it necessary. This whether or not I subscribed to onstar. “Well, here’s another nice mess you’ve gotten me into!” Oliver Hardy to Stan Laurel.

You do refer to him as Donnie, not respectful. No, not respectful and here’s why. The snatch was neat and clean. Maybe the fix was in, but it plays well. What’s next? A plan or play it by ear? Based on past events my guess is play it by ear. Won’t cost us, he said. The oil will pay for it, he said. Wasn’t the oil going to pay for the Iraq invasion? Seems Venezuela is supposed to roll,over and submit. If not. what is your plan? Who protects the oil companies rebuilding the oil infrastructure? US troops? Mercenaries … those guys are expensive. You snatched Maduro. Two can play that game. Yeah, I know. The US is the big dog this close to home, but it is a “nice mess” until proven otherwise and I have no faith in that. https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2007485346913607836 💯👍 Thanks. Every usian should read this. She is still placing the blame on the other. Conservatives just are not capable of anything else. F#$% her. Sure, but presently she’s a critical part of the architecture attempting to split “America Firsters” from Trump’s support base, and push back on our “ironclad” support for ISR. Gut feeling is the, nonZio faction will be liquidated and with relative ease. I mean they are mocked online, but who is still in charge. Disagree with the easy part. Time will tell, one way or the other. I don’t think genZ is buying what bibi is selling. File under wild speculation…. / ;) Both Isr and Kingdom Saudi Arabia (KSA) share several interests. Both want the Yemeni military threats to their govts eliminated. Both want the Yemeni threat to the Gulf of Aden passage past the Horn of Africa* eliminated. (See the courting of Somalia Land by Isr.) Both have common enemies in Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. Both are currently interested in keeping the majority of the world’s oil reserves under the current arrangement of financial control of the US/West. Which brings me to Venezuela. Much has been made about Isr’s possible interest in the attack. Nothing has been said about KSA’s possible interest in seeing an oil competitor brought under control by the US. And… going way out here… nothing has been said about the T family’s immense financial dealings with KSA. Think of Jared Kushner managing the KSA sovereign wealth fund in the US. * map: http://www.geographicguide.net/africa/images/horn-africa.jpg / end wild speculations. / ;) Venezuela’s crude is a very different type of oil–heavy–and so not directly competitive with that from KSA. thanks. That’s motive, not innocence. To run a refinery requires a mix of crude. If you only have light crude like the Gulf, you cannot make heavier crack products…. I won’t even presume to know exactly what’s going on in Venezuela, especially with so much noise in the ether. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? But I think there’s one crucial question that I haven’t seen much reporting on: is the government mobilizing the popular militias or not? Besides Yves’ one report yesterday and an article on Telesur (but not at the top), I haven’t heard much either way. If there is a popular mobilization though and if Venezuela is analogous to the revolutionary trajectory of Iran, China, or Russia, then it’s possible Trump just unintentionally gave PSUV the opening to start a Cultural Revolution (which wouldn’t contradict a backroom deal to “purge” Maduro by American black helicopters). Like I’ve said before, I don’t claim to know Venezuela or South America as well as other countries, so I mainly fall back onto comparative methods. And I recognize it might not be any more precise or scientific than astrology. The collapse of Assad in Syria surprised me though partly because I didn’t take that approach so I’m just putting it out there. This former CIA says Venezuela is nothing like Cuba the revolutionary fervor is just not there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=helSwCCGwvQ CIA Analyst EXPOSES Plan A & B for Venezuela | Ron Aledo Neutrality Studies I’ll have to watch the video later, but again, another reason I bring up the comparative method is it challenges what may seem like the most natural model at first. For example, if there’s any validity to what I’m suggesting, the analogy isn’t Venezuela ~ Cuba, but more like Venezuela ~ China while Cuba ~ North Korea. Cuba has become a uniquely hardened society with an idiosyncratic system, even if it’s clearly an ally and the ideology is superficially like Venezuela’s. Venezuela OTOH has become more of a dynamic project, where factions are going to act out different trends over time. Again, it could all be woo-woo and pareidolia, but if there’s something to it and the initial analogy is sound, the clock would be somewhere around the Cultural Revolution in the Chinese context. Also the era of Basiji reactivation in Iran and Stalinist purges in the USSR. The main uncertainty is at what point do you start the clock from: Chavez’ first election, the 2009 referendum, or something else? Because that could mean it’s either at the beginning or the end; whether the popular militias stand down or rise up over the coming weeks and months sort of answers that. Either way, I could be wrong, but I currently don’t believe this represents a successful soft coup by the US. For one, all analysis and reporting from that angle starts from either taking everything Trump says as true or a sort of depressed “resistance is futile” worldview (which I’ve said before is just really a more resentful form of TINA). And if the analogy holds, even if some high-ranking officials or generals were bought, those are usually some of the very people that get purged in periods like this. Keep in mind that the Venezuelan people have been in a hyperinflationary economy for 42 years since Black Friday* in 1983, with the current rate of exchange something like 30,000 Bolivars to the buck. This is the same situation that we fell into with Ecuador when their economy was hyperinflating around the turn of the century and we jumped in and dollarized the place, along with all of its oil reserves. To put things in mad perspective, a 1964 or earlier silver Quarter has around $13 worth of silver in content at current rates, a similar coin, a 1965 Venezuela silver Bolivar is worth around 400,000,000 Bolivars after you go through all of the new and improved Bolivars that weren’t all that. That would be the easiest sell to the Venezuelan people, financial stability vis a vis a greenback economy. * my brother in law’s sister was an elementary school teacher in Atlanta in the late 1970’s and Venezuela offered her double what she was making in the states, and then Black Friday comes along and within a month she’s making 1/4 of what she could make in the states-exit stage north. I was there briefly before Chavez came to power 92-93. The poverty was gross to say the least. Literally people without lower limbs leading protests. If they start to revert to that i would assume that they will swing back more in the Bolivarian direction, but that will take time. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? It’s the same playbook we saw with the Israeli surprise attack on Iran, just straight up BS being spewed out by the Western media mouthpieces to sow confusion. It might even literally be the same people doing the co-ordinating, or however these “reporter” scum get their blob marching orders. The Israelification of America in real time. Some of the headlines I was reading yesterday were just straight unfiltered bullshit: Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say Thanks, Reuters! Really keeping their audience informed aren’t they? FOUR whole sources supposedly too. And then via Reuters you get the same crap spewed everywhere else, eg: Venezuelan Vice President May Be in Russia: Report Western English media reporting at this point is a sewer wherever one cares to look, eg: US and Israel ‘planted’ media leaks alleging tensions before Iran attack: Report re: ‘Remove the top’: Grok AI floods with sexualized images of women – The American Bazaar One little understood or appreciated reason for the incredible increases in computer video cards improvements in refresh speed, color rendering, animation, detail, etc was/is the demand from the online pron industry. (It wasn’t driven by online gaming nearly as much as by online pron back then.) People interested in that wanted better video cards for their home computers than one needed to display simple data charts, graphs, maps, home digital pictures, or playing Super Mario Brothers, etc. The money pouring into accelerating video development for the home computer came in large measure from the ‘naughty’ market user demands back in the day. I’m not at all surprised by this Grok AI story. / ;) Shorter: some people were willing to pay much higher prices for an improved video card to get the video quality they wanted. Those much higher prices paid for better cards drove development faster than it might otherwise have developed. I remember reading years ago that the initial “profit driver” for new communications technologies is usually “representations of people making the beast with two backs.” This applies to print, photography, electronic audio and video, film, etc. etc. Remember ‘bootleg’ vinyl records of “blue joke” comics? I had a Moms Mably record once until my Mom found it. Photo cards of “poses plastiques?” ‘Girly’ magazines would come in plain brown paper wrappers, etc. etc. The infamous remark that no one ever went bankrupt underestimating the intelligence of the public also applies to morals. The underlying evil of Po—graphy is that it directly enables the sexual exploitation of the weak and the desperate. Stay safe. A little more by writer who lives there. https://www.counterpunch.org/2026/01/03/report-from-caracas-the-us-kidnaps-president-nicolas-maduro-but-venezuela-fights-back-and-maintains-its-revolution/ This from smoothie story. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you. No Making Shit Up. The Counterpoint piece does not say that and you have no source for your last para. Martyanov just dropped his talk with Garland. I have yet to check. But usually Martyanov is not making up things like this one. It´s obviously an issue: How come this all happen with RU arms and above all personnel on the ground? The above Martyanov quote is on his page fwiw https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html For what it’s worth, Venezuelanalysis confirms from their sources that 15 members of Maduro’s security detachment died (“were assassinated”) during the invasion. The source, I believe, is Andrey Martyanov’s blog (smoothiex12.blogspot.com) – word for word. As Martyanov is both quite well connected and prone to some “patriotic over-excitement” more than a grain of salt is warranted and yet it may be true-ish… Beyond that quote Martyanov´s usual chauvinism – (thanks to Yves for bringing back into discussion that word which as of late has completely vanished from the spaces that I read mostly pushed away by that awful “toxic” term) – in lieu of genuine insight on Venezuela and South America is of rather little help. So as of now it seems Russian unit when rushing to protect Maduro ran into none other than Maduro´s own guards. There apparently was a stand-off. And when Russians had “finished off ” those they came in too late. Also S-300/400 apparently were turned off. (how that worked with RUs possibly in charge? I don´t know. That´d possibly be the scene in a movie…) To equal the Venezuelan blunder with Syria or Iraq is superficial and uninformed in a way he is informed about his very own field of expertise where he is – overaly “exact” – which I cherish because he is professional. But since to his own regret he is not only commenting on military affairs re: Russia but also geopolitics he might wanna step back from some comments. Since even geopolitics is no science there you do need knowledge. It´s not as if he didn´t point out his shortcomings stating several times, he is no specialist on South America at all – but then his boastful verbage is thwarting the admission the next moment. The fact that 3rd World countries are “structurally weak” is not due to their cultural peculiarities. Which is why comparing the surrender of the Iraqi Army with a Mossadegh or Venezuela now is totally out of place. Garland actually has the more interesting quips. Both agree that Venezuela as a new target is basically admitting defeat and signals eventual retreat of the US from Ukraine. Martyanov is also hinting at setting a precedent now might well again come back the way Serbia 1999 and Kosovo 2008 boomeranged in form of Crimea 2014 and SMO now. Despite the flaws I addressed worth the 45 minutes: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/garland-and-me.html Martyanov´s latest own podcast I have not yet watched: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html p.s. Again I feel reminded by all this of Conrad´s undervalued adventure novel “NOSTROMO”. Garland brings up a funny idea but the truth behind it is essential: If Trump were to seize control over Greenland would the Europeans oppose? Of course not. Because they´re powerless. On this note one could argue, Europe is lucky not to be very rich of natural resources the US really needs. Otherwise the insane things happening here would provide material for the next decade of Hollywood flicks and high-octane action-thriller streaming content. Like French and German troops fighting US forces. I would be more concerned about the Greenlanders and Denmark recognising a double coincidence of interests with Russia and China. Re: p. s.

We had those leather safety straps at first, the ones that were hard to work with cold fingers. I’m curious how the trial goes. In the assault with a deadly sandwich case and the Comey and Letitia James cases the Trump DOJ has hardly covered itself in glory. One big difference between Maduro and Noriega is that the latter was actually running drugs, even if for the CIA, I have yet to see any compelling evidence that Maduro was doing the same. My understanding is that while no friends of Maduro the Biden DOJ thought the indictment against him put out by the first Trump admin was very weak tea and were not interested in pursuing it. What happens if a jury finds Maduro and his wife not guilty? The Trump admin certainly has shown a penchant for going ready, fire, aim on policy. >The 2025 Housing Affordability Crisis in Charts: What Changed and What Didn’t Investopedia From the article: “Gen Zers and young families will feel the pinch of still-high costs, with many of them opting for nontraditional living situations to afford housing…” I vote for “nontraditional living situations” as The Euphemism of 2026. What an anodyne way to describe four people in a one-bedroom apartment, 30-year-olds in their parents’ basement, life in a camper van or RV or a tent in a park, a habitation under a bridge. Almost makes them sound desirable, an alternative to normal living: ‘Will that be traditional or non-traditional, sir?” “I’ll take the non-traditional. I’m a bohemian poet. Give me the garret on the sixth-floor.” I think most Gen Zers would describe their housing situation in words other than “nontraditional”. Like hopeless, depressing, humiliating. But this does not detract from the clever wording of the article which obscures the fact that most young people today, to put it in the plain words not used by the article, cannot find a decent place to live at a decent price.

I saw similar library closings and dumpsters full of bound journals and techical books when Bell Labs shut down their Whippany library. I did not see it but heard a similar closure and discarding of books and journals occurred when the Holmdel library was closed. Many of the books dated from the 1960s and almost all were nearly irreplaceable to say nothing of what they could cost. The Bell Labs Whippany library closure took place in the early 1990s and though there were many advances since the 1960s those 1990s advances built upon knowledge from before often best described and explained in the books from the 1960s, 1970s, and some books from the 1980s. Trump’s America is well on its way toward reviving a new know-nothing party to serve a country of know-nothings. It just hurts my heart to see what is happening to our country. I can’t understand how anyone would cheer for this. The people enabling this are basically stupid “smart” people. It is time for an American Cultural Revolution. (The damage is already being done to “ordinary” people. Now the task is to ‘share’ the pain with the so called “Upper Crust.”) That’s gunna put a big spanner into space research by people. Their suggestion is to look on the net or or use the inter-library loan service from other federal agencies – who will unlikely have such specialized books. Maybe they should ask Musk if he wants the books from that library as his people would be able to use them. but NASA is being gutted. Thanks for this. Link to NYT article of same Goddard closure: https://archive.ph/uBZ8g Hard agree with @ambrit ITT. Way overdue. Mighty big of Elon, he’s offering free Starlink to all Venezuelans until February 3rd. Another true son of the Empire doing his part. Ha. OpenAI was offering double usage credits for their Codex coding LLM for like 3 days as a new year’s gift or something ridiculous, lol. Interesting. True. No mention of COVID, though, and the nearly 1.3 million deaths directly attributed to it, and those indirectly, like my father’s, must be causing a great deal of grief as well. If only society acknowledges it, might we be able to contend with the cause of it. We Are All in a Constant State of Grief (NY Times op ed) I often start and end my day in my mother’s garden. She died almost three years ago, of stomach cancer. The garden was sacred to her. While she was alive, I saw it as just a place to read on a lounge chair or duck out to for a smoke when I came back home to visit. Since her death, I’ve found myself drawn there. I feel closer to her when I am in the garden. I cannot claim to know the names of all the plants, shrubs and bushes, but I do my best to take care of them. It feels like taking care of her, as I had tried to do, right up to her last breath. I first noticed the preponderance of lawyer billboards in Phoenix about a dozen years ago on the freeways in town, and Las Vegas had even more of them, but you didn’t see so many in California compared to those locales, but that was then and this is now, and on my drive down to San Diego they carpet bombed billboards with their pleas for fees. What does this say about us as a society, where slimy lawyers (and casinos-the other player) are held to a higher standard of about 25 feet up? why post that AI image of a pandas? Interesting information on Danny Haiphong’s YT channel w/ Diego Sequera live from Venezuela. A fairly concise unpacking with invested corporate interests and their political operatives over some decades. Highlights include McKinsey & Company, Hedge funds/asset mgmt, Marco Rubio [his long term agenda] his affiliation with María Corina Machado, AI techbro barons with a hint of Israel, and how some AI ex Executives are now full birds in the U.S. Military …. Topping it all of is a planned trip by a large group of investor types to Venezuela. Seeing how they can help with energy and infrastructure whilst spreading freedom and democracy to its peoples …. /s Rubio said it out loud … This is the Westren Hemisphere and WE don’t need nations that are not pro American by having/sharing trade et al with nations like China/Russia. As I noted yesterday in links Venezuela has a more conservative society than America, more family formation/value orientated. Good to see the currant batch of political operatives in DC being anti family – unless your wealthy and can donate. From another episode of America is trash, at an employer I know. For all those on the High Deductible plans, remember to always check your drug prices with GoodRX (or drug discount site of choice) and ask the pharmacy if they have any additional discounts. This 2 minute search each time can save you a significant amount of money at the register. Here is an example this morning for my daughter’s medications: * Her medication started at $316 for 30 days based on the Cigna Insurance deductible negotiated price. * Pulled up GoodRX while in line and without membership, it was $67 for 30 days. Showed this to the person at the checkout. They directed me to the consultation window. * At the consultation window, I showed them the GoodRX discount. They did a search and found that that medication has a CVS coupon for $51 for 30 days. * The pharmacist added the coupon to my daughter’s account and it will now apply for all future orders! Savings of $265 by doing a little research, asking questions, and waiting about 15 mins for them to reprocess the RX! Three things to note: 1. This discount dance has to be done for every prescription and for every dependent on your plan. 2. If there is no generic, there is typically a coupon at the manufacturers website. Do this in advance, as it sometimes requires doing a bit more information sharing and back and forth to get the discount codes. 3. This may effect the deductible amount depending on how it is processed and where you live. Fun times, yes? And we’ve learned from Pro Publica recently that our generic supply is potentially questionable, but the FDA doesn’t want to expose that, so we’re left in the dark about particular plants and particular drug manufacturing runs. I am so tired of having to play these games as my minimal prescriptions continue to rise in price regardless. fyi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusano Re: Venezeula Interesting statements from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PM Takaichi: https://x.com/NaokoScalise/status/2007794084212302157 MOFA says (as expected): Japan has consistently respected fundamental values such as freedom and democracy. We have also consistently emphasized respect for the principles of international law within the international community. Moving forward, based on this consistent stance, we will continue to work closely with relevant countries, including the G7 and regional nations, to ensure the utmost protection for Japanese nationals. We will also advance diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring democracy and stabilizing the situation in Venezuela. Takaichi repeats the same talking points, but omitting mention of international law and the international community. Commentary: The heads of both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court are Japanese. Wow, they’re erasing “international law” now. re: Craig Murray on Venezuela Craig Murray weighs in. He planned on going to Venezuela. This is not entirely off the table still. Important piece, although for those who followed events the last 25 years not new. https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2026/01/venezuela-and-truth/ “(…) By pure chance, on Friday I had texted Delcy Rodríguez about arrangements for travel and accreditation so I could go and report from Venezuela and bring you more of the truth from that country that the media is hiding from you. I made plain I was not asking for financial support. Things are obviously fluid at the moment, but it is still my intention to get there. (…)” Any comparison with other countries like Iran or Syria seems to make little sense. All these societies are unique. But much more important – Venezuela is a functioning and free country and society. And one needs to keep in mind the huge success Venezuela represents. As more than one commenter here has said: Once the “civilized nations” partook in or condoned the genocide in Gaza, everything became do-able. We are through the looking glass now. RIP “rules-based order” era. Hello, IRL Risk era. Guardian Live Blog: More on Donald Trump’s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One: the president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait. “We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said. Trump had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long”, Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership would be “hit hard” if protesters were killed, AFP reports. Trump earlier threatened that acting Venezuelan president Delcy Rodriguez would pay a “big price” if she did not cooperate with the US. Janta Ka Reporter Jan 5, 2026 YT channel video where Max Blumenthal interviews VP Delcy Rodríguez is a sight to behold. Points out the upside down human rights PR that Trump and Co project and how Nicolas Maduro and his wife are solid Christians. Your email address will not be published.
