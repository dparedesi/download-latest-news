A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 16, 2025 by Ben Carlson Michael and I were out in Las Vegas last week to put on a live Animal Spirits at the annual FPA conference. It was a fun trip. We ate some good food, had some fancy cocktails, played some blackjack and talked some artificial intelligence with a few hundred financial advisors. On stage we did a deep dive into what’s going on with the biggest companies in the world and their push for AI supremacy. You can listen to the audio from the podcast here: If you weren’t one of the lucky people in the MGM conference center that day I thought it would be useful to provide some of the slides we covered in our presentation. First up we talked about the shift from investing in intangible to tangible assets by the big tech firms using Meta’s new Hyperion data center as an example: These companies believe AI is worth the investment but this is a risk and a change to their business models. Spending from the hyperscalers continues to go up, up and away: How long will stock market investors allow this? The companies spending money are getting the benefit of the doubt that this will all pay off. I do wonder when the market will want to see a big ROI on this spend. The sheer size of these companies is astounding: The Mag 7 stocks are now as big as the bottom 449 stocks in the S&P 500 combined. It seems we’ve entered the new normal of stock market concentration: At least for now. One of the reasons for this is that fundamentals are matching the stock price gains: Nvidia is now the biggest company in the U.S. stock market but the fundamental growth has exceeded the price growth since the release of ChatGPT. Analysts expect the growth to continue: Is it possible for a $5 trillion company to grow at these insane levels for this long? We shall see. Here’s a real face-blower for you: Apple and Nvidia alone are now worth nearly as much as the health care and consumer staples sectors combined. Here’s another one for you — the market cap of the Mag 7 stocks is now the same size as the energy, materials, consumer staples, health care, financials, utilities and real estate sectors combined. There have been instances of stock market concentration in the past. But we’ve never had corporations this efficient before. If you take this efficiency into account by adjusting valuations for the changes in margins, the market doesn’t appear as expensive as you might think: One of the biggest questions of the AI boom is how much the other companies that aren’t making these investments will benefit. Outside of tech, the margins are much smaller: Will AI improve productivity enough for some of these other companies to increase their margins? That would be something. And finally — the question everyone wants to know — will this end badly for these huge companies? The Mag 7 is no stranger to crashes this decade: When the expectations get out of whack will we see some or all of these stocks crash? And what does a crash look like? A 20% decline is nothing. Meta is down more than 20% from the highs right now: Are we looking at a 40% crash? 50% or more? Would an AI bubble popping offer a wonderful buying opportunity because these companies are still better at what they do than everyone else? Or what if these companies see a payoff sooner than we think and the gigantic crash never comes? I have three words to sum up my conclusion on the matter: I. Don’t. Know. If anyone tells you they know how this will play out they have a horrible case of hubris or just want their investment stance to be proven right. I remain open to a wide range of outcomes on the matter.

Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.

Title: Should you worry about an AI bubble? Investment pros weigh in.

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 14, 2025 / 4:31 PM EST / CBS News Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust. The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. Thursday's stock market tumble — when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months — fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble. Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability. "The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it," Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called "Magnificent 7" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI. "No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped," Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email. Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is "roughly half" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s. "So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble," they noted. The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting. "This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said. "So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies." Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say. "We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains," Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News. For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a "4th industrial revolution" that could supercharge economic growth. "This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026," he wrote this week in a research note. "The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology," Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk New York City’s chief financial officer wrote to Spotify Thursday to press the company for details about the recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have been running on the platform in recent weeks. Comptroller Brad Lander, a recent mayoral candidate and notable supporter of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, wrote to Spotify “about recent developments that may violate Spotify’s advertising policies and impact long-term shareholder value.” Specifically, Lander wants to know about ICE recruitment ads on Spotify, which he wrote have “sparked widespread backlash and at least one major national organization is urging Spotify users to cancel their subscription,” a reference to Indivisible’s “Don’t Stream Fascism: Cancel Spotify” campaign. “In too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down,” says one version of the ad, which was recorded by a TikTok user and archived by fact-checking site Snopes. “Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst, with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now.” “From a fiduciary perspective,” Lander wrote, he is “concerned about the reputational risks these ads may create for the company, which could hamper long-term growth, and [wants] to better understand how the company assessed these ads against the company’s stated advertising policies.” Lander wrote that the pension funds “hold significant investments in Spotify.” A spokesperson for his office said that, taken together, the funds have 691,681 shares of Spotify, worth $482,793,542 as of Sept. 30. Spotify’s share price has fallen slightly since then. A Spotify spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement: “This ad itself is part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms, including television, streaming, and online channels. Users can help control their ad experience by liking or disliking an ad or by logging into their account via web browser and updating their ad preferences.” Lander’s letter asks Spotify how it assessed the ads’ against company policy prohibiting “systemic discrimination and marginalization,” and whether the company has assessed “the impact of this controversy on subscriber retention, artist relationships, or brand perception,” among other inquiries. “Hopefully what we’ll get is good answers to the questions we’re asking,” Lander told HuffPost in an interview Friday morning. He characterized the letter as an initial engagement between a representative of New York City employee pension funds — as comptroller, Lander is a trustee of each of the five funds — and a company in which those funds have an investment stake. If Spotify doesn’t have a satisfactory response to his questions, Lander said, the city’s funds could work with other investors to press Spotify for answers or consider a shareholder resolution to do so. “In some cases [in the past], where we have been unable to get answers we are looking for, or have a satisfactory engagement, we have divested from, or sold the stock of, particular companies or sectors,” he said. “We only do that after a lot of engagement. Our strong preference is to use our position as investors to reach resolution. We do this from a responsible fiduciary perspective, believing that what we’re doing is helping increase the value of the companies we’re invested in … we’re just starting here, this is the first letter we’re writing.” The comptroller said he is concerned with systemic discrimination in the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” agenda — “and that includes any ads,” he said. “The mass deportation effort involves a broadscale hiring effort to make ICE the largest law enforcement agency in American history.” Lander noted a trend of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being arrested by immigration agents. “Essentially every time, [it is] a person of color, without, so far as we can tell, lawful basis for many of the arrests,” he said. “If you are conducting arrests without lawful basis, and they are consistently of people of one ethnicity, that is a systemic civil rights violation — and I believe these ads are part of it,” he added. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, doesn’t advertise exclusively with Spotify. Recruitment ads to become an immigration agent have also appeared on platforms including X, YouTube, LinkedIn and Meta, and on cable television, The Independent noted. Separately, DHS has spent millions of dollars on advertising pressuring people to “self-deport.” Lander said Thursday’s letter was specifically regarding Spotify’s “quite strong anti-discrimination policy — and we’re asking for how they assess these ads against that.” Lander’s letter amounts to a shot across the bow for Spotify. As comptroller, he has a legal “fiduciary” obligation to act in the best financial interests of New York City’s pension funds. As well as trustee, the comptroller serves as an investment advisor and custodian for the five funds — one each for police, firefighters, educators, non-pedagogical educational workers, and other city workers. While he does not have unilateral control over the pension funds, he has influence over the funds’ administration. Lander noted that the five funds’ responsible investing program is staffed by the comptroller’s office and that “we do a letter like this in consultation with our boards.” Combined, the funds have over $300 billion in assets under management, making them the fourth largest public pension plan in the country, according to the comptroller’s office. Lander’s office shared the letter, which is addressed to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, with HuffPost. Lander himself has been arrested by federal agents twice in recent months at the immigration court in lower Manhattan, where agents have been systematically arresting migrants showing up for scheduled court check-ins — and where Lander frequently observes proceedings. “We owe it to the families of those detained — and every New Yorker impacted by Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine — to keep showing up and demanding accountability for the violence, cruelty, and lawless abduction of our neighbors,” he said last month after pressing DHS for answers about the return to duty of one particularly violent officer. Spotify isn’t only facing pressure over the ICE advertisements. Ek’s venture capital firm, Prima Materia, recently led a 600 million euro funding round for Helsing, a European military technology company, which led to an exodus of artists from the platform.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason! The venture capital playbook is broken. Not bent — broken. In the latest 20VC x SaaStr episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll dissect why even Sequoia is making dramatic leadership changes, why seed investing at $50M pre-money might not work anymore, and what it actually takes to build venture returns in the age of AI. This isn’t your typical venture conversation about “exciting trends.” This is three investors with $3+ billion in combined AUM telling you what’s actually working, what’s spectacularly failing, and why the old playbook from 2015-2022 is now a liability. On Venture Capital Evolution: On AI Investment Strategy: On Deal Dynamics: On Portfolio Construction: On Fundraising Process: On Market Dynamics: When Sequoia replaced Roelof Botha as managing partner after just three years with Pat Grady and Alfred Lin in a split leadership structure, the venture world noticed. But the reaction from our panel was telling: this wasn’t about interpersonal drama or normal succession planning. “Whenever you have a CEO change happening in venture, it’s because something isn’t working,” Rory stated bluntly. “This is dissatisfaction about how the firm is doing relative to the competition. They missed some rounds and some deals. They passed on some great companies.” But rather than viewing this as a Sequoia-specific challenge, the panel sees it as symptomatic of a broader industry issue. “More people should be stepping aside today,” Jason argues. “VCs, executives, founders. Most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” Rory adds context: “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” The meta-lesson? Even the best firms are struggling to keep pace with AI, which means everyone else should be asking themselves hard questions about whether they’re still the right people for this moment. And Sequoia gets credit for one thing: ruthless decisiveness. “They did not do that fatal error of saying it’s someone’s turn so we’ll leave him in,” Rory notes. “They ruthlessly said, if we’re going to compete, we need these people, not those people.” Michael Burry made headlines (again) by shorting Nvidia and Palantir to the tune of $1.1 billion. Unlike most pundits who just discussed whether he’d be right, Jason actually did the math on what it takes to make money on these bets. “It brings home how hard a business it is to bet against AI capex,” Jason concludes. “You not just got to be right, but you got to be right on timing.” Rory’s take: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” The counterpoint to all this short-selling cynicism? The revenue is actually showing up. OpenAI is projected to hit $20B ARR this year, while Anthropic projects $70B ARR by 2028. The growth rates aren’t just holding — they’re accelerating. Harry drives this home: “Are we being overly British? Are we looking for a problem that’s not there? The revenue is showing up in billions.” The lesson: It’s intellectually easy to be a skeptic about AI valuations. It’s financially hard to make money being that skeptic. And meanwhile, the actual revenue keeps proving the bulls right. Few stories capture the AI revenue opportunity better than Gamma’s latest round. The company raised $100M at a $2.1B valuation, having hit $100M in revenue with just 50 people and 2 million users. Harry, Jason, and Rory are such a great combo. One of the top shows every single week. https://t.co/NB29EhA02T — Grant Lee (@thisisgrantlee) November 13, 2025 Jason and Team SaaStr are super-users and he walks through exactly how they use it at SaaStr: “Instead of sending sponsors the same dated prospectus, Gamma automatically pulls all of our data from Salesforce and our marketing automation system. It knows the exact number of leads and ROI. It knows who their competitors are and makes a fully dynamic piece of collateral in about 10 minutes.” Here’s the math that’s important: SaaStr pays $100/month for Gamma — $1,200 per year. That’s stealth TAM expansion. “How much do we spend for Google Slides? Zero. It’s built in. How much do we spend on PowerPoint? I don’t even know where my key is to Microsoft Office. So it is a stealth TAM expansion.” But Jason’s most important insight is about what’s coming next: “The lame thing about co-pilots is they were just tools. When the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk, the amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” He distinguishes between AI as a tool versus AI as a team member: “It is sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. The level of autonomy and capability — Gamma, go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, review once, and distribute to the team.” But there’s a warning embedded in Gamma’s story too. Canva now has a Gamma clone that’s “pretty good.” The competitive response time has collapsed from years to months or even weeks. This leads to one of the episode’s most important debates… This might be the single most important strategic question facing every seed and Series A investor right now. And the panel doesn’t fully agree on the answer. Jason frames the problem: “The quality of clones is only going up. I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader. The ability of AI to enable us to clone better stuff faster — Canva is borderline competitive with Gamma and wasn’t when Cliff was on the show. What does seed investing mean when you might see 10 better versions in 30 days?” Rory’s response: “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale. Once you become the anointed winner, once a market coalesces and there’s two or three people, you know, it’s yours to lose.” But Rory pushes back on the idea that this makes seed investing impossible: “You just have to internalize the game you’re in. Awesome team, run fast, be superlative on technology, get your distribution early, and then rely on that. You can’t be anointed the winner up front. Get over it everybody.” Jason’s concern is economic: “Is that okay at 50 post for a seed round? Do the outcomes justify it? If I’ve got to spread $5 million checks around at 50 post, it’s tougher.” Harry asks the critical question: “Are we getting paid for the risk?” He notes that even at the Series B stage, it’s unclear who will win in many categories. Looking at customer support AI companies that have raised Series B rounds: “I got no idea who the winner is in that category and I don’t think anyone does to be honest.” The debate crystallizes around whether you can know enough at the B to justify the valuation: Rory’s view: By the Series B, you can see rank order. “Once the horses are running and once they round the first furlong, you can actually see the rank order of where they’re running in a way you can’t at the early A.” Harry’s counter: Looking at codegen — even with clear leaders like Cursor emerging, you have Codex making incredible ground, Claude Code advancing, and Replit and Lovable coming from different angles. “I think that’s still entirely up for grabs.” The practical implication: This uncertainty means one of two things: Jason’s conclusion: “Maybe you need 40 deals at $5M. That’s $200M for first checks. $200M for reserves. That’s $400M. $100M for fees and backup. I need at least $500M for my little seed fund to make the math work.” Amid all the complexity, the panel crystalizes a simple framework for what actually works in AI investing right now. DataDog crushed earnings, with stock up 23% and $15M+ in AI-native customers. Why? They’re selling to the people making AI, and as those companies grow, DataDog sells more too. Jason: “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies. They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the Replit story — Jason deployed 20+ AI agents that generate significant revenue while requiring substantial daily management but far less human headcount than traditional approaches. The key distinction: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story. But when it’s real, when the AI agent is sufficiently autonomous to complete material high-value tasks, that’s when you’re actually part of the team, not just a tool.” “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly. I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” But he’s skeptical this is as compelling as the first two: “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” If you’re not doing one of these three things, you’re probably not going to see explosive growth. Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage. One of the most tactically useful segments came when Harry shared a founder interaction that frustrated him: the company said they wanted to “run a process” despite Harry offering terms they’d stated they wanted. Harry’s reaction: “I said, listen, if you’re running a process, you’re either optimizing for price or partner selection. I’m giving you a great price today that you said you wanted, which means you’re not optimizing for price. Which is just saying you think you can get better than me. In which case, just tell me straight.” Rory sees both sides: “From the founder’s side, they’re correct. I see more failed financings because they didn’t run a process than because they did.” But then he makes a critical distinction: “What typically happens when people ‘don’t run a process’ is someone comes in, says they’re interested, and the founder shares information serially to someone not yet ready to commit. That’s a mistake. That’s running an accidental process.” Jason has the most nuanced take on optimal strategy: “The best founders cultivate enough interest with enough good VCs that if they hit the number, they just send an email. Harry, I’m thinking about raising around before the end of the year. And Harry could say, I’ll give you a term sheet today. And the right answer is: ‘I love you, Harry. I’m not ready today. I will be ready at the end of the year.'” The key insight: “The optimal way to run it is for everyone already to want to invest for real without games before you open your data room. The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” Rory synthesizes: “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are. If a founder is smartly nurturing relationships, keeping people broadly informed, then tries to time the interest such that when they’re ready to put their hand up, there’s three people who are primed and ready to go — that is perfection itself.” But here’s the brutal caveat: Jason points out that this only works if you have stellar numbers. “You’re either YC, Neo, South Park Commons, got something, get funded — or who the hell is going to find you? You better be hot AI-native with top-quartile venture growth or you ain’t getting funded.” Harry shares a data point that proves this: A company that grew from $400K to $3M ARR (classic enterprise SaaS, 10x growth) had 120 meetings and got one term sheet at $10M on $40M post. That’s 12x revenue for a 10x grower — which five years ago would have generated five term sheets from top firms. “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason concludes. “You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” While DataDog surged 23%, Duolingo crashed 25% in the same week. The contrast illustrates everything about what’s working and what’s not in AI. Jason’s diagnosis: “Duolingo has the ‘wrong’ kind of AI. Duolingo is using AI to make its product better. Hooray. Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” Rory pushes back slightly on behalf of consumer apps: “If you’re an infrastructure company, you can co-attach to compute. If you’re a new AI apps company, you are using that compute. But if you’re like Duolingo — preexisting — what you can do is co-adopt the technology.” But Jason sees a bigger problem: “Duolingo took money from Berlitz and all these language schools. Hooray, you did that. Now, where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory makes an interesting point about where the AI opportunity in education actually is: LLM learning is equivalent to one-on-one human tutoring. What AI should enable in education is allowing everyone to get one-on-one learning instead of group-based learning. But there’s no budget in K-12 to give every kid a customized tutor. The market is adults wanting to learn a second language for business who would pay for a one-on-one coach — a niche market. Jason’s framework applies here too: “If you’re not removing humans from the equation, you’re going to be heavily discounted. You’re either getting money from compute or you’re getting money because you’re using AI to replace humans. Otherwise, congratulations on your 14% growth.” One exchange revealed how different the panel’s approaches are to portfolio construction — and why both can work. Harry revealed his team’s meeting load: “With my four investing partners, we have 80 net new companies that we meet in person per week.” Jason’s response: “I would resign. I would give you all my carry back. I sold my companies because I didn’t want to spend my life in meetings. I’ll do one a week, two max.” But Jason’s critique cuts deeper than meeting volume: “When you do 200 deals between your team, you got to meet 500, 600, 700 founders a year. I don’t want to meet 500 founders a year. Unless you’re great, you’re going to blow my mind. But if you’re not, I’m gonna start yawning about 15 minutes into this meeting.” Rory defends the high-volume approach: “Even on an okay deal, you learn nuances about a specific market from the one-on-one that you wouldn’t get from the presentation. The person inside living it every day has a crucial kernel of knowledge that you just can’t access any other way.” But the conversation reveals a deeper truth about fund construction: The Small Fund, High Multiple Approach (Hummingbird-style): The Large Fund, Maintained Ownership Approach (Lightspeed-style): Rory’s key insight: “Both are great outcomes. They’re just different ways to play the game. The interesting thing is both outcomes have great outcomes for the GP. But if you only have $1 to play with as an LP, you want the small fund 10x. If you have to deploy $100M, you have to do the big fund. The high small fund accept the follow-on dilution but make a marvelous return is the compelling product for the marginal dollar.” Speaking of Hummingbird, their Billion to One investment deserves its own section because it represents what’s possible when everything goes right. Hummingbird did their first bio deal in Billion to One and now has an $800M position on the IPO — likely representing an 800x+ return on their initial investment from a sub-$100M fund. Harry marvels: “You want freaking great venture returns? Credit due. Amazing.” But Jason asks the tactical question every seed investor should be asking: “How did they collect the capital as a seed manager to deploy enough to maintain the ownership? I don’t see how I’ll ever own 18% of something at IPO ever again.” The answers are telling: Rory makes the crucial point: “You can accept some dilution and optimize for multiple rather than ownership. If you put in $4M and get diluted from 20% to 12% but it’s a $5B exit, you’re a hero.” Jason counters with what’s exciting about capital efficient outcomes: “Navan at $4.5B, Billion to One at $5B — the power of capital efficiency and running lean delivers superior investor returns despite smaller headline valuations.” The lesson: Small funds generating 10x+ returns by accepting dilution but betting on capital-efficient companies may be the optimal strategy for seed investors who don’t have the deployment capacity of mega-funds. Pulling all these threads together reveals several uncomfortable truths: 1. The Middle Class of Fundable Companies is Gone “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason states flatly. The classic SaaS triple-triple-double-double company? A company growing from $400K to $3M ARR would have had five term sheets from good firms. Now: 120 meetings, one term sheet. 2. Most People from the Last Decade Should Step Aside This isn’t ageism — it’s pace of change. “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade,” Jason argues. “I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today. We don’t even need half the VCs we have today for the AI world.” 3. Diversification Matters More, Not Less With increased variance in outcomes and compressed time to clone, the math says diversification is critical. But diversification at seed prices requires massive funds or acceptance of lower ownership. 4. There Are Only Three Ways to Win Attach to compute budgets, replace human headcount, or massively displace incumbents. If you’re not doing one of those three things, you’re probably building a slow-growth SaaS company in a world that doesn’t want those anymore. 5. Capital Efficiency Delivers Superior Returns Billion to One at $5B and Navan at $4.5B generated better investor returns than most $20B+ outcomes because they raised less capital. The lesson: optimize for investor returns, not headline valuations. 6. The Best Fundraises Don’t Feel Like Processes Cultivate relationships over months. Have 3-4 investors ready to commit before you formally raise. Send one email and get multiple term sheets. That’s the optimal path. 7. If You’re Not Excited, You Should Retire Jason’s most important point: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” The panel is clear about what’s coming: “This year was AI works. Next year is AI is part of your team.” That transition — from AI as a tool making you more efficient to AI as an actual member of your team with autonomy, knowledge, and capability — is where the revenue explosion happens. Jason’s final thought captures the optimism underlying all the tough talk: “If you’re not incredibly excited right now, if this isn’t one of the most exciting and stressful times simultaneously, you’re missing it. This is a great enormous mega trend. It’s the biggest mega trend maybe since the early days of the internet. Leaning into it is the only sensible thing to do, and playing against it is dumb as rocks.” The old playbook is broken. The new playbook is being written in real-time. And the investors who figure it out — whether through small concentrated funds like Hummingbird or large diversified portfolios like Harry’s approach — will capture the extraordinary returns available in this moment. Everyone else? Maybe it’s time to buy that beach house. On Venture Evolution: “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade.

The amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” — Jason Lemkin “Sell to the people who are making AI and if they grow, you’ll sell more too.” — Jason Lemkin On Defensibility: “You just can’t take that early first month explosion as seriously as you used to. It’s not as defensible.” — Harry Stebbings “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Market Timing: “It’s easy to be roughly right.

Title: Stock Futures Slide As Tech Selloff Continues—Bitcoin Slips To Six-Month Low

BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff andTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Nvidia and Tesla headlined broader gains across tech stocks on Friday afternoon, leading a rebound for major indexes a day after markets posted their worst declines in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped roughly 100 points (0.2%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq added 0.7% as of Friday afternoon, after each index fell more than 1% earlier in the day and dropped 1.6%, 1.6% and 2.2% on Thursday, respectively, in their largest single-day losses since October. Stocks recovered on Friday following a widespread rout on Thursday, during which investors dumped AI stocks amid general economic uncertainty, after the U.S. ended the longest government shutdown in history, with added concerns the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates next month. Markets also appeared to react to the White House announcing that employment and inflation data for October and September would be at least partially released, after previously the data would “likely never” be published, as economists projected inflation to remain high while the labor market likely deteriorated further. Nvidia rose 1.5% to around $189, adding to a 1.6% increase for Tesla, after both megacap stocks slumped 0.4% and 2.4% earlier in the day, respectively. Other stocks turned positive by Friday afternoon, including AMD (up 1.5%), Palantir (1.9%), Broadcom (0.9%), Apple (0.8%), Microsoft (1.1%) and Intel (0.1%), among others, while Amazon (down 0.3%) and Alphabet (0.4%) remained in the negative. UnitedHealth Group headlined losses across the Dow as shares traded down 3%, followed by Nike (2.5%), American Express (1.7%) and Walt Disney (1.7%). The cryptocurrency market was also hit by a selloff, with the price of bitcoin dropping below $96,000 for the first time in six months before paring back earlier losses. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to around $96,031 after earlier falling to as low as $94,592, the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency since May. Ether, the token with the second-largest market cap, dropped to $3,130, down more than 10.3% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana’s SOL and Binance’s BNB, are down 8.8%, 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. Crypto-linked stocks similarly declined, including Strategy (down 3.9%) and Coinbase (1.3%). It appears the broader crypto market is reeling from traders lowering odds of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, as key economic data remains delayed, leading to investors pressuring riskier assets, according to Bloomberg. Liquidity has also plummeted: Exchange-traded funds investing in bitcoin reported new outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest withdrawal since they were introduced in January 2024, according to CoinGlass

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. CNET's top budget virtual reality headset is even cheaper right now, with some retailers offering instant credit, too. Get it while you can. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. Black Friday is coming up fast and it's an excellent chance to pick up all sorts of tech. While it's great to stock up on essentials when they're on sale, we always like to peek at a few luxuries, too. They're just easier to justify when the price is right. Right now, that means it's a great time to think about getting a good virtual reality headset. The Meta Quest 3S, which is already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Best Buy and Amazon. You can get the 128GB model with a game included for just $249 at Best Buy. If you want the 256GB model, the headset on its own is down to $330 plus a $50 credit thrown in at both of those retailers. This deal ends Sunday at Best Buy and we assume Amazon will follow, so you'll need to be quick if you want it. If you shop at Amazon, you won't get a discount on the 128GB model, nor does it come with any credit. However, the 256GB option includes Batman and it's $70 off, bringing it down to $330. Amazon is also throwing in a $50 credit that you can spend on anything at Amazon. If you're heading to Best Buy instead, you can save $50 on the 128GB model, plus it comes with The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners game. And best of all, Best Buy is throwing in a $50 gift card that you can spend in-store or online. Best Buy has the same $70 off offer on the 256GB model and is also throwing in the $50 gift card with this model, too. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. The Meta Quest 3S has improved CPU and graphics, which makes it great for gamers. It also has a noticeably lighter design compared to the previous Quest 2 and it has approximately 3 hours of battery life. It's the budget version of the Quest 3 headset but it's like comparing the iPhone 17 to the iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro version comes with added benefits but the basic version should serve all of your needs without breaking a virtual sweat. CNET's Scott Stein, VR expert, said in his review, "If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed-reality evolution in the years to come. And if you're thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy, and you're not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be." Stein also labeled it as "by far the best value in VR," in his review. Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving but it's rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don't pop up every day. If you've been wanting to invest in one of Meta's headsets, you should do it now while it's available at a lower-than-usual price.

Title: In the age of AI, CEOs quietly signal that layoffs are a badge of honor

Time Published: 2025-11-14T09:42:03Z

Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation. No silver bullet for New York In the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich tells Diane Brady and Kristin Stoller that most global cities are grappling with affordability issues. "New York is a global capital, but it comes at a price,” he said, citing Vienna as a city that’s doing well but weaponizing affordability as a political tool while London is “dark and it’s not lively anymore” because too many wealthy buyers have bought second, third and fourth homes in the city center. AI bubble fear hurts stock markets Stocks markets fell dramatically yesterday—and the selling looks set to continue today, according to the futures markets—led by investors expressing their disapproval over spending on AI. Oracle shares are down almost 30% over the last month as investors flee Larry Ellison’s debt-fuelled pivot to AI. “The Big Short” investor closes investment firm, maintains AI bubble stance Investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 housing bubble and dramatized in the film “The Big Short,” closed his investment firm on Wednesday and quickly took to X to continue his warnings about an AI bubble. Burry, who has already bet $1 billion against an AI bubble, explained how companies like Meta and Oracle are understating the depreciation of their AI investments to inflate profits and play down their massive capital expenditure programs. Microsoft and Amazon want restrictions on Nvidia sales to China The two AI hyperscalers have been lobbying for a change in the law that would keep Nvidia’s best chips in the U.S. market and curb its access to Chinese customers. Delta CEO criticizes government shutdown Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the U.S. government for expecting employees to work without pay during the government shutdown, which he described as “disruptive both for his business and its customers. “It was completely unnecessary,” Bastian said in conversation with YahooFinance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, and customers had to “bear the brunt of the dysfunction.” OnlyFans CEO has no middle management at her company OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair decried “that squidgy layer of middle management in the middle” during an appearance at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday, arguing that “nobody’s ever had a really good middle manager in my experience.” Instead, at her company, they hire only “incredibly senior talent” and “incredibly hungry junior talent.” S&P 500 futures are down 0.21% this morning. The last session closed down 1.66%. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.79% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 1.18% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.77%.

Title: Exowatt has a rock-solid plan to provide cheap, abundant energy for AI data centers
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/13/exowatt-rock-solid-plan-provide-cheap-abundant-energy-ai-data-centers/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T02:32:44Z

UPDATED 21:32 EST / NOVEMBER 13 2025 by Mike Wheatley Exowatt Inc., a solar-thermal energy startup backed by OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and other high-profile investors, wants to solve the artificial intelligence energy crisis with millions of hot rocks. To do that, it has raised millions of dollars – $50 million in fact, led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries. Today’s round also saw participation from other investors that included Atomic, Bridge Bay Ventures, the Florida Opportunity Fund, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global and Massive VC. The round is described as an extension of the company’s original $70 million Series A, which closed in April. Altman’s involvement stems from its original seed funding round in 2024, where he was one of several angel investors. Exowatt says its thermal battery technology, powered by solar energy, has the potential to provide enormous AI data centers with electricity at rates as low as one cent per kilowatt-hour, which would make it around 90% cheaper than the average U.S. grid rate. If it can do this, it’s sure to be of enormous interest to AI data center operators such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Oracle Corp., which are all desperate for energy as they scramble to build out their infrastructure. With data centers springing up across the country, operators are desperate to secure a power source for them, but grid queues in some locations can stretch for years. As a result, data centers are being built faster than power suppliers can keep up. Exowatt is pitching a somewhat unconventional solution to this looming crisis, with millions of superheated rocks held in storage that can provide energy around the clock. The company’s solar-thermal energy works by using concentrated solar power to heat up special ceramic or rock-based materials to temperatures as high as 1,200°C when the sun is shining. These materials act as thermal batteries, releasing the stored heat to power steam turbines that generate electricity, even when the sun goes down. It transforms rocks into a power source, and once the system is set up and in place, it can provide electricity much more cheaply than through conventional means, which typically cost from eight to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The math is compelling, especially when considering the future energy requirements of data centers. Today, these facilities consume about 1% of the world’s electricity, but the demand for AI is forecast to push that up to around 3% to 4% by the end of the decade, Exowatt says. Exowatt’s challenge is that it needs to gear up its manufacturing operation to produce 1 million thermal battery units per year. It said this target is necessary for it to deliver on its penny-per-kWh promise through economies of scale. Doing so is easier said than done, though, considering that Exowatt has only built a handful of batteries so far. Still, it has gotten enough backing to at least attempt to reach that goal. Altman is one of a number of voices in the AI industry who has been quite vocal about the need to solve the looming power bottleneck, and many of his rivals are pursuing different ideas. For instance, Meta Platforms Inc. is exploring nuclear energy, particularly the use of small modular reactors that can be located close to its data centers. Google LLC has also invested in a number of nuclear energy startups, as has Amazon. Aside from exploiting more fossil fuels, renewable energy is really the main alternative to nuclear power, and it is certainly popular with environmentalists, but the problem is that solar- and wind-farms require affordable and reliable storage solutions to be able to meet AI’s power demands 24/7. Most existing energy storage systems use lithium-ion batteries, but they’re very expensive and there are concerns around the availability of the rare earth elements needed in their construction. Thermal storage provides some advantages. The rocks and ceramics are much cheaper, and they’re also more durable. Exowatt says its rock-based storage systems can maintain heat for about five days and they never degrade – unlike lithium-ion batteries, which gradually lose capacity over the endless charging cycles they have to endure. That said, there are questions about the real-world performance of Exowatt’s system, which has never been attempted at such a large scale, as well as grid integration. Previous solar-thermal energy projects have suffered with efficiency problems and unforeseen maintenance costs, and Exowatt will have to show that its batteries can deliver on its cost promises and operate in diverse climates. That may be why the company hasn’t yet announced a specific timeline for deploying its technology, nor any major customers. Even so, Exowatt has the capital, the demand and timing on its side, and if it can scale up its technology to achieve its ambitious price targets, it might just become the rock on which the future AI industry is built.

Title: ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry deregisters Scion hedge fund amid bets against AI titans

Full Content:
Michael Burry, the investor whose successful bets against the US housing market in 2008 were recounted in the movie “The Big Short,” is closing his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management. In a letter to investors dated Oct. 27, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Burry said he would liquidate the funds and return capital, “but for a small audit/tax holdback” by the end of the year. A person directly familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the letter. “My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets,” Burry said in the letter. Burry could not be immediately reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s database showed Scion’s registration status as “terminated” as of Nov. 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state. Investment funds that manage more than $100 million of capital are required to register with the SEC. Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth. In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, “On to much better things Nov 25th.” Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burry, who was famously featured in the book and movie ‘The Big Short’, has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments. In his post on X, Burry said he spent about $9.2 million buying up about 50,000 put options on Palantir, saying that the options would allow him to sell the stock at $50 apiece in 2027. The put options convey the right to sell shares at a set price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view. Palantir’s shares were trading at $178.29 on Thursday, giving the company a market value of $422.36 billion. So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD Last month, Burry posted an image of his character from ‘The Big Short’ movie and warned of bubbles, saying that, “Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.” “Burry’s decision feels less like ‘calling it quits’ and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Burry, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated. AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of the S&P 500 index’s returns since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, JPMorgan Asset Management wrote in September. “Don’t count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital,” said Schneller. The investor’s short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Big Short,” and its film adaptation. His profile on X, titled “Cassandra Unchained,” is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe. Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation. Burry’s Scion ended last year with shares in American Coastal, Bruker, Canada Goose, HCA Healthcare, Magnera, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health and VF Corp, but the firm ended those bets earlier this year. During the quarter ended June 30, Burry’s Scion Asset Management was more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs. Burry, who launched Scion Asset Management in 2013, joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors. Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India’s Adani Group and electric-truck maker Nikola. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company’s bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor’s bitcoin holding company Strategy. Chanos has argued that Strategy’s valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor. Advertisement

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And we’ve found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to our forecasting approach.Iteration by iteration, my skepticism has turned to light distrust, and then into actually getting value out of our company forecasts. Like most AI companies, we draw from improvements against our LLM-agent benchmarks, Deep Research Bench and Bench to the Future.But at the end of the day, to evaluate it, I think it’s best to follow Charlie Munger’s advice: try to disprove what Stockfisher says. Now, even after an hour of carefully reading through a stock, I generally can’t find any major flaws, and I hear the same from other serious investors.And, since it’s software, not human analysis, we applied it at scale. We have long-term forecasts for revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500.We do a Buffett-style intrinsic valuation, that doesn’t take the stock price into account. This means you can sort by the difference between what the stock market says, and what Stockfisher says. Some very interesting neglected companies rise to the top, and we’re starting to process the mid-caps and small-caps too.Stockfisher is live at https://platform.stockfisher.app, no sign in required, to see what we have on the top stocks. (I was happy to see Alphabet comes out well. Meta looks good too, but Amazon and Apple do not.) I would love for you to judge for yourself if the quality of analysis is up to your standards.

But they do get certain things right. And if you figure out the patterns of what types of manager promises tend to play out, and assess them individually for their reliability, you can reason about these business model changes decently well. reply reply The most interesting aspect of this is backtesting. Quant models get run on past data to see if their predictions work.When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world. And then there's the fact that they do their research on the open internet. It makes backtesting hard - but not impossible.We wrote about how we do our pastcasting validation here: https://stockfisher.app/backtesting-forecasts-that-use-llms When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world.

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Treasuries

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3,136.50, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$135.99, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock. A DAT’s share price reflects not just the value of its crypto treasury but also investor sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Advisors should review three things: Advisors can then reframe client enthusiasm around fundamentals. Is the goal diversified exposure or speculation on a premium? That distinction determines whether a DAT belongs anywhere near a client’s portfolio. Q: What should advisors be ready to explain when clients compare DATs to spot ETFs? A: This will be the most common question. The answer is that spot ETFs hold the digital asset directly, trade close to net asset value, and operate under clear regulation. DATs, on the other hand, are companies using corporate balance sheets to hold those same assets and sometimes using debt to do it. That means the potential upside can look exciting, but the risk profile is closer to a leveraged stock than an ETF. Advisors should prepare to discuss taxation, concentration risk, and how DATs might react differently from the underlying crypto. Helping clients see that difference turns a speculative headline into a teachable moment about structure, liquidity, and risk tolerance. - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You CoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Internet Computer Drops 13.2%, Leading Index Lower Cronos (CRO) joined Internet Computer (ICP) as an underperformer, falling 5.8% over the weekend.
