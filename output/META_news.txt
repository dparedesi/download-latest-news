Title: The AI-Driven Stock Runup May Not Be As Good As Many Assume

ByErik Sherman, Senior Contributor. The witching hour. Is this about All Hallow’s Eve? No, it’s about tech companies — AI-focused in particular. Promise, hype, and intra-sector cross-investment has created an interesting dynamic of economic concentration and risk. By no means is this to say that tech companies and their stocks are bad. It also isn’t to say they will be good at all times and past performance is a guarantee of future returns. Technology stocks have shown strong returns, as they have in 2023 and 2024, according to U.S. Bank. The information technology sector gained 23% year-to-date on October 21, 2025. The tech-focused communication services sector gained 25%. In contrast, the S&P 500 increased by 15% and the return for the Nasdaq composite was 19%. More specifically, the so-called Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — comprise 36.6% of the S&P 500 as of October 2025, up from 12.3% in 2015, according to The Motley Fool. In year-to-date performance, the Magnificent Seven had returns of 18.6% compared to 14.5% of the S&P 500. A big reason is due to artificial intelligence growth. Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group calculated that corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024. Year-over-year private investment was up 44.5% and mergers and acquisitions, up 12.1%. The current AI and tech success, though, creates some structural issues. “The S&P 500 is built on a ‘survivor bias’ basis, with companies having the most success making up the largest weightings,” Vince Stanzione, former currency trader and CEO of financial publisher First Information, says. The higher the market capitalization of the company, the higher its standing in the S&P 500. Stanzione compared two S&P 500-related exchange-traded funds: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight EFT (RSP) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). “If you compare the equal-weighted RSP to SPY, you will see the equal-weighted is doing poorly, only up around 8% [year-to-date] compared to 17%.” The reason SPY did better is that it includes larger shares of top technology stocks. “It is somewhat worrying to have such high exposure in the S&P 500, and at some stage the sector will correct,” he adds. “For my own trading and clients, we have also had large exposure to mining stocks — which are hardly represented in the SPY — and, even after the recent pullback, this is up 113% YTD and on a far lower [price-earnings ratio] multiple than tech stocks, so there are still opportunities in other sectors. But for those just passively tracking the S&P 500, they remain tech-heavy and will keep dancing until the music stops.” The market excitement over AI is fueled by investor belief on its future. But the concentration of tech acts in a way like leverage in investing. The expectations can pile on atop the other. An example The Motley Fool gave was Nvidia. Since the end of 2015, the company has added trillions to its market cap, moving from the smallest contributor to the Magnificent Seven to the largest. That was a jump from 0.8% of the combined value to the largest at 21.2%. If you have ever seen a juggler balancing a spinning plate on a pole, then you know the plates must keep rotating to maintain their stability. “The current market continues to consolidate with outperformance limited to fewer and fewer stocks, mostly based on the promise of AI and, perhaps more compelling, spending on AI infrastructure,” says Geoff Strotman of investment consulting firm Segal Marco Advisors. “Many of these stocks happen to be the largest stocks in the US stock market (and the largest in history), which is quickly driving performance and valuations higher.” Strotman notes that while the S&P 500 is at “historically high valuation,” there are many other areas of the global stock market — US small caps and non-US stocks — that remain at average valuations. That can mean good returns with lower investment amounts. He adds that emerging markets are having a strong year, up almost 30% year-to-date. “The emerging markets outperformance is also a reminder for institutional investors to remain diversified and rebalance into underperforming asset classes in order to take advantage of return divergence and opportunities as Emerging Markets was just about left for dead at the beginning of the year,” Strotman says. However, concerns about risk from tech, or any other type of stock type, can create its own problems. “The debate over whether AI is a 'boom' or a 'bubble' is interesting, but in reality, it’s a distraction to everyday investors focused on long-term wealth,” says Alex Michalka, head of investments at Weatlthfront. “No one can know the answer for sure, and attempting to adjust your strategy based on a guess is a form of market timing, which historically is not a wise approach. Instead, you’re better off focusing on ensuring you have a well-diversified portfolio that includes the level of risk you’re comfortable with based on your situation and time horizon.” In other words, if technology is an area where you find heightened risk, you don’t need to run away from it. A diversified portfolio is an intelligent investment tool. Michalka mentioned direct indexing, in which you buy individual stocks to imitate an existing stock index like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. You can look for areas of tech that gives some of the upside without being married to it.

Amazon led the stock market on Friday, with shares jumping 9.6%, to the finish of another winning week and month. The Dow rose 40.75 points, or 0.1%, to 47,562.87, finishing the week up 0.8%. The S&P 500 rose 17.86 points, or 0.3%, to 6,840.20, ending the week with a 0.7% increase. The Nasdaq rose 143.81 points, or 0.6%, to 23,724.96, climbing 2.2% for the week. The online retailer was by far the strongest upward force on the market reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations, per the AP. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for Amazon's cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace not seen since 2022. The company's size, roughly $2.4 trillion, means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without Amazon, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Apple had less effect on the market even though it's bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Tim Cook said Apple benefited from strong revenue for its iPhones and its services offerings, which include its app store.

Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 2.7% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, giving nine shares to investors for each one they own. They helped offset a drop for AbbVie, which fell 4.5% even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit than expected. Additional drops on Friday of 1.5% for Microsoft and 2.7% for Meta were the heaviest weights on the US market.

Title: AI Didn’t Layoff 14,000 People. Amazon Did.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2025/10/31/ai-didnt-layoff-14000-people-amazon-did/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T20:11:34Z

ByAnn Kowal Smith, Contributor. Amazon cut 14,000 jobs this week, citing, in part, efficiency gains from AI. But blaming AI for layoffs is like blaming the thermometer for the fever. AI didn’t eliminate these jobs. Amazon did. Its leaders did. And they’re not alone. Across the tech giants, AI isn’t making these decisions—it’s masking them. Efficiency has become the new moral alibi—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and many others have all cited AI as justification for thousands of cuts. Every time leaders make a human decision and hide behind a technical one, they erode something far more valuable than headcount. They erode trust. The language of “AI gains” has become a convenient disguise for an old reflex: cut now, justify later. Leaders once blamed “the market.” They blamed Wall Street. Then automation. Today they blame AI. We’ve found the perfect scapegoat—one that never talks back. And efficiency becomes the virtue that absolves the decision. The further leaders move from the people affected by their decisions, the easier it becomes to treat humans as inputs rather than individuals. Data becomes a shield against empathy. AI doesn’t make these choices, but it makes it easier to hide from them. That’s the new face of moral outsourcing—not machines taking over judgment, but humans abdicating it. Here’s the irony: the productivity miracle AI promised hasn’t yet arrived. A recent MIT study found that despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment in generative AI, 95 percent of companies have seen no measurable return. Only five percent of pilots are delivering meaningful financial impact. If the payoff isn’t here, what exactly are we optimizing? The truth is, companies aren’t chasing performance, they’re shifting their bets. As GlobalData’s Neil Saunders observed, “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The story isn’t about productivity. It’s about where investment is flowing and what’s being left behind. Amazon’s own numbers tell the story clearly. The company isn’t shrinking because AI made it leaner. It’s shrinking to pay for AI. Net sales are up double digits year over year, and operating income topped $18 billion last quarter. Yet free cash flow has fallen from $53 billion to $18 billion in a year, driven largely by record spending on data centers, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure. Amazon is cutting costs today to fund the AI infrastructure that might, someday, deliver results tomorrow. Efficiency, pursued for its own sake, stops serving people and starts consuming them. From Microsoft to Meta, Google to Dell, the same logic echoes: cut people now to finance the systems to eventually replace them. The question isn’t whether AI will make us more productive. It’s what we’ll have sacrificed by the time it does. Each algorithmic layoff widens the distance between leaders and the people they lead. It doesn’t just trim headcount. It thins the thread of trust that holds organizations together. The stock market is booming. Yet, in the U.S. alone, nearly 700,000 job cuts were announced in the first half of 2025, up 80% over the same period last year. Every time an organization maximizes profits and machines over people, the social contract that binds workplaces together is collateral damage. It used to be that if you were smart, worked hard, and loyal to your company, they were loyal to you. Those days are disappearing. Now we ask laid off workers to pay the price for oversized payrolls, while the leaders move forward unaffected. It’s unrealistic to suggest that a company can never downsize, that it can’t restructure itself to meet the needs of a disruptive technology. But when people are involved, the “how” matters. When an automotive supplier found itself in a similar pickle, needing to reduce its workforce by 30% to stay afloat, its leaders charted a different path. Instead of mass layoffs, they offered voluntary retirement plans, each with generous severance, and met their reduction needs organically. Preserving everyone’s dignity, those who left and those who stayed remained deeply committed to the company and its success. You can’t innovate in a climate of fear. And more than half of workers now fear losing their jobs in the next year. People stop taking risks. They comply. They play it safe. Ironically, at the dawn of the AI era, we’re engineering the conditions least conducive to innovation. At its highest and best use, AI could help us cure cancer, rebuild infrastructure, even reverse climate damage. But we may throw that future away. Not because machines failed us, but because we did. It doesn’t have to be this way. AI isn’t inherently dehumanizing. It’s a mirror, reflecting the values of those who build and wield it. LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman envisions a new “relationship economy,” one where social intelligence sits at the center of work. “Human ideas are the new code,” he says. “Human energy is the new data center. And a new world of work anchored on the human brain is about to emerge.” It’s an inspiring vision—one we could realize, or ruin—depending on how we use the power in our hands. Octavia Butler captured this paradox decades ago in her evocative short story, The Book of Martha, where God asks a woman to redesign humanity to save the world. Every solution she imagines creates a new harm. The story ends not with certainty, but humility. That’s the leadership lesson AI demands: every “efficiency” we celebrate carries consequences we can’t yet see. Every act of progress leaves a shadow, and real wisdom lies in seeing both. As AI moves closer to the center of decision-making, leadership’s job is to keep accountability in human hands. The future of work won’t be written by bots. It will be written in the daily decisions leaders make about people. Taking responsibility begins with owning those choices. Leaders should state plainly what was decided, why it was decided, and who is accountable. Transparency is the first antidote to moral outsourcing. It also requires re-humanizing the data. Every data point represents a person, a livelihood, a story. Before optimizing, leaders should ask who is affected, what relationships might be broken, and what trust might be lost. Data without dialogue degrades judgment. And finally, responsibility means measuring what truly matters. Not just productivity or profit, but belonging, learning, and creativity—the conditions that make innovation possible. In an age obsessed with speed, these are the slow variables that determine whether progress endures. If we want AI to serve humanity, we must first take responsibility for the humans we lead. Committed employees need a committed employer. It’s a social contract grounded in mutual trust. Amazon’s layoffs aren’t just another round of cost-cutting—they’re a warning to every company chasing the same playbook. When the world’s most powerful firms reduce people simply to expand their AI budgets, they send a clear signal about the future of work: speed over stewardship, profits over people, efficiency over empathy. The short-term gain is easy to count; the long-term cost isn’t. It won’t appear on a balance sheet. It will surface later, in the trust we squander, the talent we silence, and the future we forfeit. The danger isn’t artificial intelligence. It’s artificial leadership.

As CNBC reports, Meta shares dropped more than 11% on Thursday and have thus far dropped another 1.3% so far today, as of writing. At its bottom yesterday, October 30, Meta’s share price reached its lowest point in three years. Meta, like many tech companies, is frantically racing to improve its AI technology and tools. The stock market fears that Meta’s aggressive capital expenditures on AI are perhaps too aggressive and are arguably unlikely to pay off. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company’s AI spending, which is a huge chunk of overall annual capital expenditures nearing $72 billion. “It’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business. That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting,” Zuckerberg said during the call. Meta is far from alone in its massive AI spending. CNBC notes that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, increased its projected expenditures to $93 billion, while Microsoft indicated that it also expects to spend more this year than in 2024. Although Meta had a disastrous day yesterday, its stock value is still up over 9.5% so far in 2025. Nonetheless, as MarketWatch wrote yesterday, “There’s an AI bubble.” There are many failed AI startups, and spending is unsustainable. However, MarketWatch argues that the biggest players, including Meta, are “essentially unassailable.” The economics publication claims that these companies are so big, and their core businesses so successful, that even “extended periods of disappointing AI returns” won’t sink the ships. This aligns, at least in part, with what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week. As reported by Fortune, Powell claims that most of the AI-related spending is being done by successful companies with actual earnings, rather than speculative spenders. Powell says the AI bubble, if there is one, is not like the dot-com bubble. But massive companies have failed before, sometimes in catastrophic fashion. Whether investors’ worst fears may be realized, there is clearly a general uneasiness about how at least some companies, including massive ones, are approaching AI.

Title: Amazon laid off over 14,000 people this week—but Wall Street is loving it anyway

The mighty heft of Amazon is hoisting the U.S. stock market higher on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, erasing much of its slump from the day before and nearing its all-time high set on Tuesday. The index is on track to close a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, which would be its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher. Amazon led the way after jumping 11.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming huge cloud-computing business has reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Apple also helped lift the market after its stock added 0.3%. It likewise delivered a better profit report than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. The two Big Tech profit reports were the among most important on Wall Street Friday because Amazon, worth roughly $2.4 trillion, and Apple, at over $4 trillion, are two of the biggest companies in the market. They alone account for 10.6% of the S&P 500’s total value, even though they make up just 0.4% of its membership. That means their stock movements can carry more weight on the S&P 500 index, which sits at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, than hundreds of other stocks. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 14.7% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 3.2% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 1.9% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to every investor with one. They helped offset a 3.7% drop for AbbVie, even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits to help justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the stock market has become too expensive. Friday’s overall gains helped Wall Street recover from Thursday’s slump, when the S&P 500 fell 1%. Investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as the investment spree related to artificial-intelligence technology keeps gushing. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia Friday. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month and at the fastest pace in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record index after a report showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased a bit after their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned markets that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.08% from 4.11% late Thursday, but it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. ___ AP Business Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon hoists Wall Street toward another winning week and month

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Amazon’s massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company’s. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Another highly influential stock, Apple, had less of an effect on the market even though it’s bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 7.5% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 4.6% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 2.7% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to investors for each they own. They helped offset a drop for AbbVie, which fell 4.5% even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie’s stock came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies broadly to deliver big growth in profits to justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive. A day earlier, the S&P 500 slumped 1% as investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as part of the investment spree underway in artificial-intelligence technology. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. Additional drops on Friday of 1.5% for Microsoft and 2.7% for Meta were the two heaviest weights on the U.S. market. All told, the S&P 500 rose 17.86 points to 6,840.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40.75 to 47,562.87, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 143.81 to 23,724.96. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record after a report showed industrial production rose more in September than expected. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased following their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.09% from 4.11% late Thursday, though it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. Other central banks have halted cuts to rates or hinted at pauses recently, and “it seems this is it for the 2025 easing season in developed economies,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report.

Title: Amazon and Apple Set the Pace

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Tech gets a confidence boost -Some sector rotation is happening -Market still digesting Fed meeting Amazon.com and Apple are going to kick us off in a big way today as the market continues to drive higher. It is very encouraging to see two of the stalwarts of the market be the further drivers of the rally. In fact, Amazon.com crushed earnings as the closely watch AWS end of the company beat and helped round out a very solid earnings report. In the case of Apple, they beat on iPhone sales and gives great confidence to the overall market, but to the tech sector in particular. We will talk about earnings more in a bit. Let’s take a look at what happened in yesterday’s session. We saw the market stumble a bit yesterday as the tech stocks gave a much cloudier picture. Yesterday was a tale of two cities as Alphabet had a 2.5% gain on the day with a strong quarterly report. Much of this was driven by advertising and cloud businesses. These were two very widely followed areas by analysts and they certainly were happy with what they saw. When you put up $100 Billion in Quarterly Earnings that sends a large message. META Platforms, however, were the other end of the spectrum. The stock was down over 11% on the day. This was primarily due to concern over expenses rising faster than expected and a one-time tax charge of $16 Billion. One other stock that stumbled of note yesterday was Chipotle Mexican Grill which was down 18,2%, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500. The company reported a struggle with the 25–34-year-old cohort of customers (worth watching) and with that missed on the Quarter and lowered yearly outlook As we head to todays Halloween trading action, as mentioned Apple and Amazon have us off to a great start on the day. Some of the other earnings we wanted to mention are from the Energy Sector. Exxon Mobil Corporation reported earnings that slightly missed expectations and continued the lower year-over-year trend. Much of that is due to the lower price of Crude Oil and the stock is down slightly. Chevron Corporation is mostly unchanged as the earnings also fell year over year, but they did top estimates The other things to watch all revolve around the rotating of Investor expectations. That is one of the things that many have pointed out is a seeming rotation by some of the large firms from an incredibly strong weighted tech sector to the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors. We also have a seeming “trade truce” between the US and China. We know that this is a fragile partnership and one that has the investing community nervous. The last one to keep in mind is the constantly changing probabilities of a December rate cut after the Fed comments on Wednesday. This will be a constant subject for us to visit over the next few weeks as Investors try to digest what this means. As always stay with your long-term Investment goals and stick with your trading plan Have a Happy and Safe Halloween!

Title: How AMZN Stock Rises To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/31/how-amzn-stock-rises-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:31:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Following Amazon’s exceptional Q3 2025 earnings disclosed on October 30th, which saw the stock rise 12% in after-hours trading, the crucial question is: Is this the start of a significant surge that could elevate AMZN stock to $500 or more? It's certainly a possibility. Amazon announced earnings per share of $1.95, exceeding the expected $1.57—a 25% surprise that caught Wall Street completely off guard. Revenue reached $180.2 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, surpassing the $177.8 billion consensus forecast. But here’s the real highlight: AWS revenue skyrocketed 20% to $33 billion, representing the strongest growth since 2022 and outpacing analyst predictions of $32.4 billion. This isn’t just about exceeding expectations—it’s about AWS demonstrating that it can compete with Microsoft Azure’s 40% growth and Google Cloud’s 34% growth in the AI era. Why is this significant for the stock price? Because it directly tackles the primary issue hindering Amazon’s valuation. Before the earnings release, AMZN had only increased by 2.2% year-to-date while the S&P 500 gained 16%. Investors were concerned that Amazon was falling behind in the AI competition. These results show a different story. In the following sections, we will explore how AMZN stock could potentially double from this point. However, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding individual stocks like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns over 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? In general, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. How is Amazon's AI strategy structured? Unlike competitors who rely on partnerships, Amazon is developing its own infrastructure empire. The company has just launched Project Rainier—an $11 billion AI data center in Indiana equipped with more than 500,000 Trainium 2 chips specifically intended for training Anthropic’s Claude models. What differentiates this from Microsoft or Google’s strategies? Amazon is not just hosting AI—it is also manufacturing the hardware. AWS CEO Matt Garman indicated that the company spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures in the past 12 months. This vertical integration grants Amazon pricing power and margin growth that competitors find difficult to match. Can AWS maintain growth of 20% or more? The evidence suggests it can. Demand for AI computing from enterprises is escalating more quickly than supply. Amazon has increased its data center capacity by 3.8 gigawatts in a year—more than any other cloud provider. With Anthropic set to utilize 1 million Amazon chips by the end of 2025, AWS has secured significant revenue predictability. What is fueling Amazon's advertising growth? The figures present a compelling narrative. Ad revenue reached $17.7 billion in Q3 2025, reflecting a 22% year-over-year increase, building on the $56.2 billion annual run rate established in 2024. Amazon's distinctive role as both a retailer and a media platform offers unrivaled targeting capabilities that command premium pricing. How does this stack up against other high-growth sectors? While AWS receives much of the attention, advertising serves as Amazon’s hidden growth driver. The introduction of ads on Prime Video broadened inventory while retaining the valuable e-commerce data that boosts the effectiveness of Amazon's ads. This dual revenue stream strategy resembles successful technology giants like Google. For more, see – Amazon’s segment financials. And what about the main retail segment? Don't underestimate the foundation. Amazon's online store generated $247 billion in 2024, and $67.4 billion in Q3 2025, accounting for 37% of total revenue. This segment isn't declining—its consistent cash flow is fueling the high-margin AWS and advertising growth that elevates valuation metrics. What needs to occur for Amazon to reach $500? Let’s analyze the scenarios. At the current price around $251 (post-earnings), Amazon is trading at approximately 35x trailing earnings. For the stock to double, we need either earnings growth, multiple expansion, or a combination of both. Can earnings double within 2-3 years? The trajectory indicates it is plausible. With AWS growing at over 20% alongside improving margins, advertising revenue potentially approaching $90-100 billion, and AI efficiencies enhancing operations, there is a pathway to over $11 per share in earnings—double the 2024 figures. Will the market accept premium multiples? This is where it becomes intriguing. If Amazon maintains its current 35x multiple on $11 earnings, that alone would elevate the stock to $385. However, companies driven by AI growth often command multiples of 40-50x. Applying a 45x multiple to $11 earnings would suggest a valuation of $495. What about the revenue growth narrative? Amazon’s guidance for Q4 2025 of $206-213 billion in revenue indicates that the company is on track for $900 billion in annual revenue within three years. This level of scale, combined with margin expansion due to AI investments, underpins premium valuations. Consider that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presented an adaptable approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon’s Q3 2025 earnings signify a potential turning point. The combination of accelerating AWS growth, booming advertising revenue, and substantial AI infrastructure investments creates multiple avenues for significant stock appreciation. The calculations supporting a rise to over $500 aren’t speculative—they're based on sound business fundamentals. With AWS sustaining over 20% growth, advertising potentially reaching $100 billion, and AI fostering margin expansion across all sectors, Amazon possesses the revenue growth and profitability trajectory to justify premium valuations. The primary catalyst is investor recognition that Amazon isn’t falling behind in the AI race—it’s constructing the infrastructure necessary to lead it. Project Rainier and the Trainium chip initiative provide distinctive advantages that competitors cannot easily replicate. For investors with a 2-3 year horizon, valuations in the range of $400-500 seem achievable.

It sounds like a cool sort of buzzword from the now generation but you have the phrase ‘at sixes and sevens’ that goes back many, many centuries so this is just a new variation of a very old phrase- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sixes_and_sevens One of my favorite authors titled one of his works of amazing short stories: ‘Sixes and Sevens’ Enjoy some timeless tales of O. Henry therein: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2851/2851-h/2851-h.htm Another recent thing kids said, skibidi, also sounded very like a certain type of old time comedy – Ish Kabibble, for instance. Vaudevillians and hep cats never made it to the dictionary. Copacetic being a rare exception. Then a long gap until enbiggens and cromulent. Now these stunts. I don’t really care. In my elementy school, we used an otherwise perfectly normal word in a similar way for a couple of years. I’d imagine we were not unique among fourth and fifth graders. It was kind of like the soup time meme kids were doing a few years ago. If anyone is interested in origins fo skibidi. LITTLE BIG – SKIBIDI (2018) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDFBTdToRmw skibidi toilet – season 1 (2023) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrlkXOxlvCk Joke from my childhood: Why is six scared of seven? Because seven ate nine, of course. oops, I should have read the comments first but I became over excited… That said, How do you catch a squirrel? Climb a tree and act like a nut! This is $1MM of free advertising given to dictionary dot com during a slow news day. 1. pick a “word” that is polarizing; 2. use your “credentialed” PR staff to kick up the dirt; 3. profit? cuz a 15 or 55 y.o. is going to immediately start using dictionary-dot-com, lmao. Speaking as somebody who bleeds Dodger Blue… Hoping we win games 6-7 Speaking as a Jays fan of forty years… I’m hoping the Dodgers are deep-sixed. The middle school teachers at my daughter’s school all showed up dressed as the number 7, and fake coughed/sneezed throughout the day. Sick sevens. National Guard in each state is ordered to create ‘quick reaction forces’ trained in civil unrest AP Border Patrol takes lead role in Trump administration’s Chicago crackdown, carrying out more arrests than ICE CBS News ICE Is Now Wandering the Streets, Scanning People’s Faces to Check If They’re Citizens Futurism ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Everything is going down in lefty Big Smokes, feel pretty safe here in Tiny Town where we are politically right smack dab down the middle and surrounded by a sea of red down in Godzone. A local wag calls us ‘Caucasian Island’ as Haoles make up 91% of the population. That said, i’m reading reports in regards to ICE/NG being seen on the streets in nearby Woodlake, which has about 10k people and is 87% Hispanic. I drive by orchards all the time, and how can you tell in a drive-by how the workers are feeling, but it doesn’t seem any different-the way they go about doing things, there’s about 25 cars parked in front of the orchard, a few port-a-potties, a couple of 10×10 popup shade structures and a mess of ladders to be able to pick oranges on high. It’d be so easy to round them up~ Trump has got over three more years in office. Plenty of time for ICE to eventually get around to smaller places like those orchards near you unfortunately. Once you create a monster organization like ICE you cannot keep them idle but must be always be sending them off to new areas to harass. They had a veteran’s parade yesterday in Fayetteville NC. “All the forces were represented”. Well no. there were no face covering ICE agents waving from the floats. That little detail escaped the TV coverage…. So no future ‘Thank you for you service’ coming anytime soon? The 97 year old owner of a cabin near me passed on last year and his 30 something grandson inherited it from him, and over the summer he’s been up half a dozen times, and each sojourn he tells me that he’s a military combat veteran about 4 or 5 times. On one side 99% of the population has nothing to do in terms of being in the military, and on the other side the 1% never lets you forget it. “Thank me for my service” Thank him for letting himself be used. losing the use of his legs(t-7, i think) by being used for bullshit geopolitical shenanigans is what rumbled my stepdad Don’s stomach ever after. he was the biggest antiwar person i have ever known…and when my boys played whatever that combat vidgame was and started talking about joining the marines, because it would be awesome, i sat them down on his front porch with him for an afternoon…and all that nonsense just kinda went away. My army service began 1959. I never left the United States. Yes, I served but then the draft said I had no choice. I was not an enthusiastic soldier, but I did my duty. No pats on the back required. I considered myself fortunate to have been too young for Korea and too married and a father for Vietnam. Many many years later in circumstances that escape me, I was asked if I have served in the military. I said yes. This bright eyed young person said, “Thank you for your service.” Inwardly, I recoiled. It felt the same to me as hearing, “Have a nice day.” I did what I was asked to do and required to do. Leave it at that. Wondering if the airlines will include announcements for ICE & CBP in their preboarding of :Active Duty US military “ More likely that sooner or later that Trump will declare a national ICE Day so they know that they are appreciated. That one is worthy of starting a pool !! Vegas Book—What day/ year will the holiday be created? I’m thinking Labor Day will be repurposed too, and any expectant mother that delivers on that day, gets a $100 gift card from Amazon. ICE really needs dress uniforms! Something inspired by Hugo Boss from the 30’s, in black. With the Nike Swoosh on the collar instead of lightning bolts. And medals, too. Lotsa medals. methinks those red or black Sith robes would be more apropos… Oh no! Roundup Ready braceros! A new wonder tool for Big Ag. It is widely known that more people die from cold than heat. According to ScienceDirect, “In most epidemiological studies, excess cold deaths far outnumber heat deaths.” https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519625000543 Thus, the report from BioScience which mentions rising temperatures will be harder to convince those who are more comfortable as temps rise, to do something now, only for it to be too late to do much when extreme temperatures arrive in the future. ” Historic U.S. Civil War Ship Decaying Due to Fungal Invasion ” I think that there is only one real long term solution here. Remove the old planking and arrest any fungi, perhaps by having those planks frozen for future research. Then replace those removed planks with hardy timber treated to resist any future fungi infestations. Of course eventually that may leave you with the Ship of Theseus quandary- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus Remember too that this ship was built during the US Civil War as a temporary class of ships and would normally have been scrapped after war’s end- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cairo The scientists working on the restoration might want to look into using Chlorine Dioxide as a fumigant. A ship is sort of a building, sort of. / ‘) Effect of Chlorine Dioxide Gas on Fungi and Mycotoxins Associated with Sick Building Syndrome https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1214660/ thanks, Flora! not sure how i could apply such a gas to my house, tho…the july 4th rain event left me with mold, galore. ive sprayed 3 times with a diluted pinesol in a hand pump sprayer. my poor roofing skills are generally tolerable, save for such events(30+” in 36 hours or so) it is a whole world away from where it was right after the event when the sun came out, though… i dont wake up as a snot monster when i stay in the hammock out here at the wilderness bar. I think that is what is being done with the USS Constitution–thete’s a grove maintained by the Navy to supply timber for maintaining the ship, too. So the relevant skills and resources are not lacking. i hafta say, maintaining a grove for such things is rather cool. i support such uses of my tax dollars. Add to that the Navy Experimental Hemp Plantation to the north of Meridian, Mississippi. As the boys down at the supply house like to say: “Your tax dollars at rest.” This reminds me of a story from Gregory Bateson that I read several decades ago in either a Whole Earth Catalog or a CoEvolution Quarterly Magazine article. And I find an online article making a referrence to that story and then offering some background and context around it. It is titled: ” Oak Beams, New College Oxford The beams of the New College, Oxford dining hall come with an amazing story. ” Here is the link. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oak-beams-new-college-oxford As a person who lives very close to the border in Imperial County CA and has regular interactions with the Border Patrol agents, I can tell you that we are all happy to see these a–holes going somewhere else. I am sorry for the people inland who they harass, but at least they are not here in the constitution free zone causing traffic accidents (they drive like maniacs) and annoying the locals, many of whom have family on both sides of the wall. The BP here are overstaffed, no one is crossing in this area, so the agents mostly sit in their cars where there is a signal and watch porn. Occasionally they get restless and go forth to bother whoever they can. God protect us from bored cops. Please see: https://jennbudd.substack.com/p/border-patrol-achieves-its-goal-of Where Is the West Heading? Valdai Discussion Club ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As a charter member in The Pyrite Billion, you can sense the fools goal is to effectively put an end to 500 years of being all that. What would an isolated America look like that has 800 military bases within the country to hold the people in check? The Liberfascistarian Republic of North Koreamerica. “Losing the Swing States” Would that everything the authors dread come to pass — a consummation devoutly to be wished … Interesting headline on this Axios article, paywalled. Democrats’ rift with unions erupts as shutdown pain worsens https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/democrats-unions-labor-trump-shutdown-airlines Teamsters, too, once true-blue. Um, the “Swing States” in today’s link featuring that title are members of the BRICs So these unions are happy to see a hundred million other Americans lose their health care due to sudden unafordability at every level so they can get back on the federal job sooner. Just as the teamsters and others are happy to double or triple the speed of global warming for everyone else so they can have “good jobs at good wages” in the meantime. The solidarity candle burns at both ends. Is the Democrat leadership continuing the shutdown because they fear that the huge premium hikes on voters’ health insurance will lead the voters to abandon Obamacare in favor of Medicare for all? The Democratic leadership is not leading the shutdown. The Total-Three-Branches ownership-and-control Republican leadership is leading the shutdown, to prevent swearing Grijalva in so as to keep putting off the discharge petition to get the Epstein Files released so as to keep protecting our Pedophile President Donald ” The Groomer” Trump. Democrats’ insisting on extending the Obamacare subsidies is just Grindr Mike’s pretext and excuse. South Korea’s 30-year quest for nuclear subs pays off. What comes next? Breaking Defense South Korea needs nuclear subs even less than Australia. Have you asked the South Koreans why they want these submarines? Do you think you can manage to convince them that you are right and they are wrong? the waters around the Korean peninsula are not deep. (electro-diesel subs can achieve the same goals for a lot less money) If looking through the prism of purely Korean defense, nuclear-powered attack subs are a ego-driven boondoggle—just like their Establishment’s drive a few years back to have a blue-water carrier strike group like France or the UK. Western Europe might have grown tired of being a US vassal—not the Korean establishment. Even their “left-wing” current president is as fervent pro-vassal as his right-wing predecessor. Not necessarily – the Chinese appear to be investing in relatively small shallow water nuclear attack submarines to replace their Kilo class subs. Its not clear what their purpose is, but it may be that they see value in having them hide in the canyons of the South China Sea for longer periods than is possible for AIP. The Koreans may have similar ideas. Their most recent subs are capable of launching medium range ballistic missiles such as the Hyumoo 4 – the thinking seems to be to ensure that they can sit off shore North Korea (or unnamed other local adversaries) to maintain the ability to carry out rapid decapitation strikes. A key element of RSK strategic thinking appears to be a focus on a very rapid and precise counter-strike on key underground bunkers in the event of an attack. And South Korea is nowhere near a vassal. They have proven very adept at using the US defence umbrella to follow their own strategic objectives in both politics and economics. This move is highly likely to be part of an overall policy of becoming a key defence supplier to the US (i.e. making the US dependent on them as a supplier). Nothing says “nowhere near a vassal” like jumping on the Ukrainian bandwagon, and pushing North Korea right into the arms of Mother Russia. Some might consider it the best gift Kim Jong Un could wish for (and one of acts of self harm that US vassals are ritually engaging in), though it must be a sly 4D chess move by totaly-not-a-vassal, and a part of some convoluted South Korean gambit. Launching rapid decapitation strike is where it’s at, expecially when you know for sure that nukes will be boomin’ back atcha. Who’s the enemy for the S Koreeans? An enemy that necessitates nuclear subs? The depth of the water is completely irrelevant to what power plant a sub uses…. No one asks South Koreans what they want. That’s the whole problem with being a vassal. As far as convincing goes, wise man say that it’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. I do think that South Koreans are smarter than Ukrainians, and that they might figure things out by themselves before they run out of people. Who cares what yankee slaves want? They’re standing in opposition to the legitimate government of the Korean people. Long live the Democratic People’s Republic. I have. Then I realized I am not a Korean any more. The Rev Kev is needed here, so that we can make a final judgment on who needs nuclear subs more. South Korea’s nuclear subs are a commodity — Canada, which needs nuclear subs even less than just about anyone, wants to appease Trump by spending an absurd 5% of GDP on defence, but doesn’t want to be seen as rewarding the US for its blackmail, is looking to buy some. And it probably makes sense to buy something that likely will actually work. Well, Canada used to need to patrol it’s ice covered Northern coast. Now, by the time the new boats are built, there may not be any ice left…. re: Yes, Everything Crashed–Just Not For You Charles Hugh Smith An American physician with nearly 50 years of experience brought me up short when he reported that for many Americans, the healthcare they receive is equivalent to what third-world residents receive. The algorithm serves me up quite a lot of videos of Americans who have moved overseas to so-call third world countries (mostly in Central America) and the medical care they describe sounds dreamy compared to the US. It’s cheap, with lots of face time with actual doctors, and with a dearth of paperwork. Daniel Swain is a weatherman’s weatherman, there is really nobody like him, truly a climate savant (and I mean that in the nicest way) and so widely respected. Any kind of weather related event happens on the left coast, and he’s always quoted-as he’s the expert. Now aside from nabbing an operating system and calling it his own, what does Gates know about the climate in order to make such a declaration? Gates seems to know his own mortality. Just can’t get ‘enough’…? Re; New Not-So-Cold War/War? Don’t do it “In reality, it is neither Westerners nor Putin who are primarily responsible for the hold of “anti-Russians” over Kiev.” Umm… NED efforts since 1990s? “Yats is our guy”? (Nuland) That antidote looks suspiciously like a Lyle Lovett tune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4evzpIVnMVs It looks like a horse that’s into Water polo. When I first saw it I thought the motor on the back was actually a vulture!! That’s how dark my thinking was after just reading the headlines for today AI layoffs to backfire: Half quietly rehired at lower pay The Register Uh…what do you mean “backfire”? Literally this. Far from the worst-case scenario, this is pretty much the next best thing. I just re-read Immanuel Wallerstein’s World System Analysis. How do capitalists increase profit ? Externalize costs. Cut taxes. Reduce wages. The bottom 90%’s share has steadily declined since the 1970s. Tax cutting has been relentless. The EPA is under attack. That said, fire and rehire at lower wages is just part of the program. re: “Mass hunger approaching” and “National Guard in each state”…. Seems like I’m watching an orchestrated effort – by both parties – to run the Cloward-Piven strategy. The poor will be hurt…. again. The political question or calculation is: which party will be blamed for the pain and failure? Is this all about next year’s midterm elections? A game of political chicken? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward%E2%80%93Piven_strategy At some point, after then Dem Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill worked with Reagan to raise the SS retirement age to ‘pay for’ Reagan’s tax breaks to wealthier citizens, after Bill C ended “welfare as we know it” which increased poverty, and after Obama traded away an extension of unemployment benefits during the GFC to get a win on another issue, I began to think the Dem party no longer gives a toss about the poor, the unfortunate, or the mistreated. Scary interpretation is to brace for more horrible revelations about Dem spying, scandals, Biden dementia denial, self-dealing and so many other festering sores will lead to pitchforks and torches. The do-nothings just talk and line their pockets, like head grifter Pelosi, while constituents worry about getting food. You don’t hate all politicians enough. The investigation into Biden’s use of the auto-pen, and a cover-up of his mental deterioration can be found at 23:48 of this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/A5_f-0yEYOE Unbiased Politics with Jordan Berman Right there with you, Flora. The Executive seems to be making the case that you don’t need good government, so you don’t need Congress, so you don’t need elections. And the People have gone from citizens to consumers to monetizable assets. And if not Rule#1, then Rule#2. “monetizable assets” aka property. Re: With mass hunger approaching as food stamps expire Saturday, huge price increases revealed for Obamacare healthcare plans Looks like family member’s plan has 50% increase in premium and the deductible doubled!!! awful — how is this cluster(care) not befouling Saint Obama’s image? rhetorical ? smh The rhetoric is calling the ACA ‘Obama Care’ where it is used as a smear to the democratic party alone, despite the fact that he signed into law – as opposed to veto – after the ACA had passed through house and senate (dems and repubs) – as is the usual course of things in the USA – for his signature. In other words, it was not just some idiot president tossing around executive orders as has become custumary over many decades of illusionary leadership. My view is that it largely passed because both the house and senate were captured by their true constituency -finance capitalism devoted to puffery and asset bubbles- and it was cleary stated with ill-defined sloganeering, or, should I say con-artistry (makeing things up where the mark/victim/target/voter is left to make the conclusion as to the true meaning of the art – most often given to believe that they are the true beneficiaries of aforesaid con-artistic statement) such as: government should be shrunk down to baby sized in order to more easily kill the baby in a bathtub, government should be run more like a business (failing, as always, to mention what type of business – monopoly business, fraudulent business, banking, private equity, widget production?- or that most businesses fail in the first five yrs), Regulation is making business to difficult so we have to deregulate businesses because the government is just to darned hard on them Jawbs – cut the red tape (of course they fail to disclose that the deregulation was mainly in the Financial services industry whose cliches included ‘making money the old-fashioned way’ ((not dislosing the ‘old-fashioned way’ -was the ‘way’ before Glass-Steagle closed down on fraud and speculation))), ‘Hope and change’ (not disclosing that what it meant was ‘ I sure as hell hope that nobody notices that nothing will change). Mexicans do jobs that Americans won’t do —of course, not mentioning that Americans won’t do those Jawbs because of the abject poverty wages and slave like conditions that are now coming to roost for americans because of asset inflation (cost of living increasing faster than income for that outgo)– maybe it’s a great way to force americans who are tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free into cheap labor for industrial faming……..I’m sorry, I forgot that the idea is to get rid of paid labor through automation, AI and bond servitude), MAGA – “Make America Great Again” … a little late to ask – For who? because the answer is the same as it has been for a long time…..“I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.” Thomas Jefferson “To achieve victory, high finance needs to disable government, which is the single power able to regulate, tax and otherwise curtail its expansion. To disable political democracy, finance buys control of the electoral campaigns so as to promote politicians acting as its officers. It also buys control of the television, radio and published mass media, and uses endowments to buy control of the academic process. Together, these are the various organs that represent the “brain” of society.” Michael Hudson We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace–business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me–and I welcome their hatred.” Election eve speech at Madison Square Garden (October 31, 1936) Franklin Delano Roosevelt The well spring of which was the Heritage Foundation, under the auspices as a free market solution – too public health care. Lambert and NC unpacked this long ago, he put on his yellow waders, devil in the details, fine print, and most of all the billion it took to launch a crappy internet platform and a hoard of barley qualified ACA guides. It was code spit out for a huge payday and future income rents with people in need of care as the crash test dummies post facto. I can’t wait for AI to be the new human resources manager/decision maker … sorta like in the Netflix show Barry … investors demand it … What do you call somebody on food stamps? …a Foodlatelist I give that pun the Stamp on Approval. “Russia offers temporary ceasefire for journalist access in Ukraine” Putin is playing it smart here. The Ukrainians have downplayed how serious it is in Pokrovsk and Kupyansk so by inviting journalists in, they would be able to report the true situation. Only it is not going to happen. The Ukrainians have said ‘I also remind all media that any visits to Russian-occupied territory without Ukraine’s permission are a violation of our legislation and international law. They will have long-term reputational and legal consequences. We are watching closely’ so they are threatening any journalists that might think of taking up the offer- https://www.rt.com/russia/627171-ukraine-journalists-safe-passage/ So something on the order of about ten thousand Ukrainian soldiers are about to fall into the Russian bag. And the Zelensky regime will demand that they must fight to the last and to sell their lives dearly or else it will make Zelensky look bad in the media. I may have misunderstood the reporting, but I think Russia is willing to stop firing so that reporters can travel in Ukraine. I don’t think that the reporters have any contact with the Russian army at all. So, it’s obviously not going to happen. But as you say Rev Kev, very clever on Russia’s part IMF is ready to ‘help’ Jamaica indeed. The carrion feeders probably froth at the mouth everytime any kind of crisis threatens outside of the G20. Also, the gleaner is a terrible outlet with a history of emotive reporting. They have articles that sound more like the excerpts from a YA crime thriller than actual news. That said, it might be impossible to find impersonal, worse critical, reporting in any Jamaican paper. The same seems to go for impartiality as well. There are plenty of non-profits stepping up to help. There is no need for these ghouls. They will likely demand austerity and charge interest on loans to the Jamaican government. Just say no! They will absolutely demand austerity but whether or not the govt cares to avoid it is anybody’s guess, I can only hope. One optimistic note is that the Clinton faction probably won’t be anywhere near Jamaica. Maybe. The Clinton’s may be more “deep state” than that. Despite being low hanging prosecution fruit, we’ve seen little noise on that front. Bill, eyeball deep in the Epstein affair. Hillary, SoS/top tier arms dealer, bribes funneled through the foundation bearing their name. They have been keeping a suspiciously low profile. Thanks for adding the quotation marks. My first thought when I saw the headline… “US Envoys Put Lebanese Army Under Watch” Those US envoys can say what they want but the Lebanese are not going to start a civil war by going after Hezbollah just to keep these goofballs and the Israelis happy. For a start, Hezbollah is better equipped than the Lebanese army because the west has always kept the Lebanese army weak so as not to worry the IDF. Same as in Jordan. In addition, Hezbollah has combat experience which the army does not really have. Another factor is that you have may families that have members in Hezbollah and the army so they won’t want to see any fighting. Finally, the Lebanese know that once Hezbollah is disarmed, that will be the signal for Israel to invade the country and occupy at least the southern half so that they can set up their Settlements there and make it part of Greater Israel. Those US envoys can pound sand. AI layoffs to backfire: Half quietly rehired at lower pay The Register As predicted here on NC, one of the few LLM success stories. It’s working exactly as intended. Per the House calendar, over the past three months, these jokers have only been in session for a grand total of 12 days. They took off the month of August, then worked a few days in September after Labor Day.

He used the opportunity to send a distress message confirming for the first time to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam.

Bubble delicious How OpenAI Uses Complex and Circular Deals to Fuel Its Multibillion-Dollar Rise (NY Times via archive.ph) Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology. Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution. Why was 6 afraid of 7?

Pretty funny, as expected Trump just kneecapped the GOP’s shutdown strategy (CNN) After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet President Donald Trump finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it. Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t. Oh noes That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it. So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president. But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend. It is very unhelpful, because it demonstrates what people mostly don’t know — at any time, the Senate can just decide to pass legislation with a majority vote. Democrats very much don’t want Trump running his mouth about this, either, I bet. For one, it violates “norms” of the Senate, and Democrats worship norms above all else. And that’s one reason they find Trump so vulgar, I mean, tearing down parts of the Whitehouse, how dare he? Otherwise, they’re very much on board with Team Trump, not even having a reversal of the punitive cuts in the big beautiful pile of garbage as a minimum bid to vote to end the shutdown. Fun.

A wave of bullish options trading has turbocharged the U.S. stock market’s rally, propelling the S&P 500 close to the 7,000 mark after gaining 17% so far this year. Traders have shown strong appetite for call options, pushing the one-month rolling calls-to-puts ratio to its most optimistic level in nearly four years. This surge in demand highlights the growing confidence among investors betting on continued market strength. (Source: Reuters) The sharp rise in call-option buying has left options dealers in a “short gamma” position, where they tend to amplify market swings rather than absorb them. In this setup, dealers sell stock futures when markets decline and buy them when prices rise, inadvertently increasing volatility. This dynamic means price moves in either direction are likely to become more pronounced. If the S&P 500 breaks above the key 7,000 level, dealers’ hedging activity could actually accelerate the rally. Since they are short gamma, dealers would be forced to buy stock futures to rebalance their positions as prices rise, adding fresh upward pressure. As Chris Murphy of Susquehanna Financial Group noted, the influx of aggressive upside call buyers has created conditions that could temporarily keep the market’s momentum alive. However, the same mechanics that drive rallies can also deepen declines. If the market starts to weaken, dealers could sell stock futures to hedge, worsening any pullback. Analysts caution that investors may have already priced in too much optimism, leaving little “fuel” for another big leg higher. SpotGamma’s Brent Kochuba believes the market could easily pause or retrace some gains from current levels. Much of the recent enthusiasm has been centred around the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. But according to Nomura’s Charlie McElligott, this rush into upside calls may have peaked. He expects a short-term pullback of 3% to 5% in major U.S. indexes, citing investor fatigue, rising concerns over AI spending, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate cuts.(Disclaimer: This slideshow has been sourced from Reuters.)

Title: The Changing American -- and International -- Buying Culture

There is no question that we in the U.S, have turned a big corner when it comes to how and where we shop. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can turn it on (that is, if it is ever turned off) and traverse the shelves of millions of companies' merchandise, shopping the world without moving an inch. Contrast that with pre-digital days when families had a Sears, Roebuck or a Montgomery Wards catalogue and thumbed through them, routinely, to see all the marvelous gimcrack that money could buy. To put things in perspective, Montgomery Ward, the company that actually invented the mail-order catalog in 1872, ended publication of its general catalogue in 1985 due to financial difficulties and competition from modern retail formats. Sears ceased publication of its full-line catalogue in 1993. I remember both, fondly. They were "dream books" where all manner of fascinating (and many ordinary) items called out from their silent placement on one of hundreds of pages to ordinary Americans to please consider them for purchase. These books were thought to be in direct competition with local merchants, but few or no local shop owners had the space or financial wherewithall to stock them. Both Sears and Wards opened their stores at roughly the same time (Sears in 1925 and Wards in 1926). Their popularity grew quickly, but both maintained strong original customer bases among rural Americans. For the next fifty years or so, Americans displayed pretty predictable buying habits. Then, in the late eighties, the spread of the computer began to alter those habits. Online merchandisers started appearing, the most prominent of course is the ubiquitous Amazon which made its debut in 1995 (in 1994 it was called "Cadabra"). The shopping paradigm took a massive jolt as the company went from strength to strength during the 1990s. From a startup selling books, music and videos, the company soon changed its business model to that of a multi-sided marketplace platform (MSMP) which now connects sellers (who list and sell products), buyers (who shop through Amazon’s site or app) and third-party service providers (delivery, advertising, developers, etc.). The company actually took the Sears/Wards concept and ratcheted it up and applied it to the modern marketplace thanks to digitalization. Today, Amazon earns money by facilitating transactions between these three sides of itself and taking a cut through commissions, fees, and services. In some ways, Amazon resembles Sears and Wards and all other previous merchants. It buys wholesale and sells retail. Unlike its bricks and mortar predecessors, though, it engages in third-party marketplace sales by using its digital platform to reach customers, and it takes a referral fee (usually 8%–15%) and sometimes fulfillment and storage fees (FBA) from the companies whose products are listed. The company has a Web Services Division (AWS) which is a cloud-based computing division launched in 2006. It provides servers, storage, databases, and AI tools to businesses, globally. (This division is Amazon's most profitable one.) Then there is Amazon's subscription services which include Amazon Prime (membership for free shipping, video streaming, music, etc.) which generates recurring revenue and strengthens customer loyalty. Another revenue stream for Amazon is its sale of ad space on its website and applications. (Sponsored product listings, banner ads, and video ads now make Amazon the third-largest digital ad company after Google and Meta). Amazon and its founder learned much from Sears and Wards. Both older companies offered ancillary services like: insurance, credit and financing, automotive and home services and mail-order repair and service. It is fair to say that both of them were trusted by American consumers. Their guarantees were honored and their service was sterling. Amazon's return policy is seamless and trusted by millions of customers who know that they will be treated fairly by the company if a product doesn't live up to its claims. In pre-Amazon days, local merchants lived and died by their reputations. If customers lost faith in or were treated poorly by local merchants they stopped patronizing them and their businesses failed. Amazon sits on the same slippery slope and knows that its reputation is built one sale and sometimes one return at a time which is why it has adopted policies similar to those of Sears and Wards. There is a reputational value for many companies to have their products listed with Amazon because they know that they will not have to stand at the front line and defend their own individual return policies. Amazon will do it for them, and if Amazon treats its customers well, it reflects positively on manufacturers who don't have to deal with dissatisfied customers if something goes wrong. That is a double-edged sword, however, as Amazon gets all the credit for the successful consummation of the sale and the after-sale experience. In essence, individual companies cede their reputations to Amazon's sales fulfillment policy. Granted that a bad product is still a bad product, and the original manufacturer will still have to defend it, but the whole return experience rests in Amazon's hands. This singular return policy issue is often a deal-breaker or deal-maker for American consumers. Trust is key and so is ease of return. Other online retailers know this and are keenly aware that it is not only the products that compete with each other but sales, return and service policies as well and they can often make the difference between a sale or a miss. Websites went mainstream in the mid-to-late 1990s, but it wasn't until around the new millenium at the beginning of the dot com era that the bulk of retailers discovered the benefits of a web presence. Our buying culture began to change as more and more Americans began to go "online" and dip their toes in the digital retailers' water. Twenty-five years ago there were $25 billion in retail online sales. Today, global retail sales are $6.3 trillion. By comparison, Sears' highest annual sales year was in 2003 with $53 billion. Amazon's net sales in the same year were $5.26 billion. How are American consumers shopping today? If we look at "traditional" non-digital bricks and mortar retail sales in the U.S. today, the figure is estimated to be about $7.26 trillion. U.S. online (digital) retail sales in 2024 are estimated at about $1.19 trillion. While the actual sales figure disparity is huge, there is one very worrisome trend that keeps physical retailers up at night. It is "showrooming." Showrooming is simply a situation where a potential customer will visit a physical store, view an actual product on display, note its price and then take up a salesperson's time with a number of questions, after which they will leave and do an Internet search (probably on Amazon) and make their purchase based on price. Obviously, this disadvantages the physical retailer that has to inventory the product, display the product, educate his workforce on the merits of the product, and then worry that the customer will change his mind after purchasing it and return it at which point the retailer must then incorporate it back into his stock as a "used product" and take a loss on its sale. Meanwhile, Amazon has dedicated online retail marketplaces with websites in about 23 countries. There are eleven in Europe and the U.K. but none in Denmark, for example, to take just one Scandinavian country. One might ask why that is. Apart from the obvious market size (Denmark has only 6 million people) there are other reasons, one of them being the labor issue. Denmark follows what’s called the Danish model, a system based on collective bargaining between unions and employer organizations, rather than strict labor laws set by the state. Around 65%–70% of Danish workers are union members, and unions are deeply involved in setting working conditions, wages, and benefits. Employers operating in Denmark are expected — almost socially and politically required — to recognize and negotiate with unions. Amazon’s stance on unions is one of resistance to unionization. The company prefers direct employee management rather than collective bargaining and has fought union access in many countries (including Germany, the U.S., and the UK). In countries where unions are especially strong — like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden — Amazon’s reluctance to engage with unions has created tension in what can only be described as the "Nordic labor conflict." In 2023 in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Transportarbetareförbundet) and Union launched strikes at Amazon’s Swedish logistics partners because Amazon refused to sign a collective agreement. Danish unions, including 3F (Fagligt Fælles Forbund), HK Handel, and others, supported the Swedish strike, refusing to handle Amazon goods from Sweden. This Nordic solidarity action effectively made it impossible for Amazon to operate freely in Denmark without recognizing a union agreement. As of today, Amazon still has no collective bargaining agreement in Scandinavia, though negotiations have been discussed. The practical effect on Denmark is that Amazon has avoided opening warehouses, logistics hubs, or data centers in Denmark as doing so would legally and socially require negotiating with unions. Instead, the company serves Danish customers through Germany, where it can maintain control of operations while still reaching the Danish market. This has given cover to Danish retailers who are still able to avoid in-country Amazon competition and continue to charge high prices for many of the same goods. However, if Danish consumers wish to purchase goods through Amazon's marketplaces in E.U. countries they can avoid paying customs duties or tariffs as the purchases are considered intra-E.U. sales and not international imports. Danish customers will still pay the onerous 25% Value Added Tax on products shipped to Denmark through the EU VAT One Stop Shop (OSS) System. The future for physical retailers is one of adapt or fail as the Internet and AI join forces to find the best deals across many digital platforms and place further pressure on traditional merchants that have avoided changing their business models. This goes for stores in Denmark that must shell out vast sums for store rentals and high wages for employees and for "showroomers" where steadily rising costs challenge their bottom lines.

In countries where unions are especially strong — like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden — Amazon’s reluctance to engage with unions has created tension in what can only be described as the "Nordic labor conflict." In 2023 in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Transportarbetareförbundet) and Union launched strikes at Amazon’s Swedish logistics partners because Amazon refused to sign a collective agreement. Danish unions, including 3F (Fagligt Fælles Forbund), HK Handel, and others, supported the Swedish strike, refusing to handle Amazon goods from Sweden. This Nordic solidarity action effectively made it impossible for Amazon to operate freely in Denmark without recognizing a union agreement. As of today, Amazon still has no collective bargaining agreement in Scandinavia, though negotiations have been discussed. The practical effect on Denmark is that Amazon has avoided opening warehouses, logistics hubs, or data centers in Denmark as doing so would legally and socially require negotiating with unions. Instead, the company serves Danish customers through Germany, where it can maintain control of operations while still reaching the Danish market. This has given cover to Danish retailers who are still able to avoid in-country Amazon competition and continue to charge high prices for many of the same goods. However, if Danish consumers wish to purchase goods through Amazon's marketplaces in E.U. countries they can avoid paying customs duties or tariffs as the purchases are considered intra-E.U. sales and not international imports. Danish customers will still pay the onerous 25% Value Added Tax on products shipped to Denmark through the EU VAT One Stop Shop (OSS) System. The future for physical retailers is one of adapt or fail as the Internet and AI join forces to find the best deals across many digital platforms and place further pressure on traditional merchants that have avoided changing their business models. This goes for stores in Denmark that must shell out vast sums for store rentals and high wages for employees and for "showroomers" where steadily rising costs challenge their bottom lines.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have his head in the clouds—and that might be the problem. Shares in the Facebook parent are getting crushed Thursday after it unveiled a mixed set of third-quarter earnings last night and doubled down on plans to billions more on artificial intelligence over the coming year. “Our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully," finance chief Susan Li told investors late Wednesday. “We expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. As a result, our current expectation is that Capex dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025." Those remarks overshadowed both a record quarterly revenue tally of $51.2 billion and a $16 billion tax hit that ate into the group’s bottom line. “Meta has always been a company willing to spend its way into the future," said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank. “This quarter confirms that pattern, only now the bet is far larger and the payoff less immediate." Meta’s challenge, however, is that it can’t finance its AI ambitions through cash flows in the way that rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which have massive commercial cloud computing divisions that generate billions in revenue, are able to do. And that leads to more debt. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Meta is planning to raise $25 billion through a six-part corporate bond offering that will include debt that doesn’t mature until the year 2065. A deal Meta finished last week, aimed at building a new data center in Louisiana, also moved $27 billion in debt from its balance sheet by structuring it through a special-purpose vehicle. Zuckerberg hinted at the idea of selling some of its excess computing power to outside customers if the group “overshoots" on its spending and infrastructure plans. “And then you know, the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation," he said. “But we’d grow into that and use it over time." A lot can change in that waiting period, however, especially given that Meta remains caught in the inherent contradiction of AI itself: If the technology is successful in speeding up tasks and accelerating online efficiencies, users will likely then spend less time on the ad-based platforms such as Facebook and Instagram that drive nearly all of the group’s profits. It’s also worth noting that the Metaverse, Zuckerberg’s last great tech vision that was launched with great fanfare in late 2020, has been something of a dud. Reality Labs, the division created to power that alternative universe, lost $4.4 billion last quarter, taking its cumulative red ink past $70 billion in less than five years. Bank of America analyst Justin Post, however, remains a believer. “We expect Meta stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and free cash flow pressure in 2026," he said in a note published Thursday. “However, we see Meta in a position of strength with massive user network and opportunity to integration compelling AI products (including content creation tools) over the next two years." Still, Post lowered his Meta stock price target by $90, taking it to $810 a share, although he kept his Buy rating in place. Meta stock was down 9.6% at 679.73, a move that would mark the biggest single-day since April 2024. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Integrating event information and multi dimensional relationships for improved financial time series forecasting
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22926-y
Time Published: 2025-10-31T00:00:00Z

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.
