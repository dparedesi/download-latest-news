UPDATED 20:07 EST / MARCH 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Cloud-based artificial intelligence infrastructure startup CoreWeave Inc. today announced it plans to buy the AI model development firm Weights & Biases Inc. for an undisclosed price. The company confirmed the acquisition plan just minutes after The Information first reported that it was “in talks” to buy Weights & Biases in a deal valued at $1.7 billion. CoreWeave has emerged as one of the AI industry’s hottest properties because it provides enterprises with access to that most treasured resource: the graphics processing units that power today’s AI services. Through its cloud infrastructure, enterprise customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. can obtain on-demand access to some of Nvidia’s most powerful GPUs, including its H100 and H200 chips, which are designed to provide accelerated computing power for large language models and other AI workloads. San Francisco-based Weights & Biases, which had raised more than $250 million in funding from investors since its founding in 2017, has built a platform that promises to speed up the development of AI models. It provides extensive capabilities to AI developers, including tools for managing training datasets, testing how changes to a model affect its performance, and troubleshooting technical problems. In addition, Weights & Biases offers more specialized capabilities, including a set of features for fixing so-called “hallucinations,” or erroneous responses that are sometimes generated by large language models. Its platform has proved to be a major hit, and the company claims it’s being used by more than 1 million AI engineers, including some from enterprises such as OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia Corp., Snowflake Inc. and Toyota Motor Co. CoreWeave said it will integrate Weights & Biases’ capabilities into its cloud infrastructure platform in order to give customers a more comprehensive “end-to-end” AI experience. Not only will they be able to run their models in its cloud, they’ll also be able to build and test their own. Collectively, the two companies aim to help customers accelerate their AI roadmaps and bring new applications to market faster. It promised that Weights & Biases’ existing customers will continue to be allowed to deploy their AI models wherever they like, meaning they won’t be forced onto its cloud infrastructure – though they’ll likely be “encouraged” to consider it. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that CoreWeave’s management has recognized that many enterprises prefer to buy a complete AI solution that can simplify their forays into AI application and model development, housing everything under one roof. “They want a turnkey cloud platform that lets them build and operate their next-generation AI applications and do everything associated with them in one place, and that’s what CoreWeave aims to give them,” he said. CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Executive Michael Intrator described Weights & Biases as a “phenomenal platform” that helps companies of any size to get a handle on the complexities of building AI models, deploying them and monitoring their performance. “Together with CoreWeave, we will bring this grit and passion for innovation to customers at an even greater scale, with the goal of rapidly accelerating adoption across the world’s leading AI labs and enterprises,” promised Weights & Biases CEO Lukas Biewald. The acquisition is subject to “customary closing conditions” and is expected to be finalized in the first half of the year. Assuming it does go ahead as planned, it will bring an even greater sense of urgency to CoreWeave’s plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange later this year. Only yesterday, the company revealed it had filed the necessary paperwork for its initial public offering, saying it intends to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the “CRWV” ticker symbol. CoreWeave’s IPO filing revealed that the company has seen dramatic growth over the last year, with its revenue rising by a stunning 700%, to $1.92 billion, in fiscal 2024. It’s expecting to grow even faster in the future, too, with more than $15 billion in signed contracts that it has yet to fulfill. The company remains unprofitable, though, posting a loss of $863.4 million that year.

Title: GOP Is ‘Trying to Gaslight’ Americans Into Believing Trump Has Made Their Lives Better, Tara Setmayer Says | Video

“I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for,” the former GOP comms director adds Tara Setmayer thinks the GOP is doing a lot of gaslighting to keep the American people convinced President Donald Trump is making their lives better. In the wake of Trump’s renewed push to place major tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the stock market took a hit and prices around the U.S. continued to increase. Setmayer – a former communications director for the GOP – explained that the party is having to cover for the president’s choices with a lot of gaslighting for promises made before the election. Watch her breakdown while on MSNBC Tuesday below: “I think the Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people why Donald Trump’s actions so far in his few weeks that he’s been in office, how has that improved their lives?” Setmayer said. “It hasn’t and no matter what they keep saying, they’re trying to gaslight the American people into thinking everything’s better. ‘This is much better — you’re going to have to go through some pain but it will be better eventually.’ I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for.” She continued: “They didn’t hear about that ‘some pain’ part first in order to get this magical better economic situation. The economic situation was actually pretty good under Joe Biden, but a lot of the American people didn’t feel it.” The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Big tech has been hit especially hard since Trump took office – ironic since many of them were prominently displayed behind him on Inauguration Day. Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, all who were represented at Trump’s swearing in, have seen their shares take a sizable hit since 2025 began. Only Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has enjoyed a price climb so far.

Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA+1.43%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+1.13%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL-0.19%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT+3.02%), Google (GOOGL+1.32%), Meta (META+2.47%) or Amazon (AMZN+2.32%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA+1.42%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR+5.43%), Salesforce (CRM+1.58%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Big Tech Stocks Down Big as Wall Street Hit Hard in Wake of Trump’s Tariffs

Four of the five major tech companies represented at President Trump’s inauguration have seen their share prices decline in 2025, including Tesla, which has taken a 30% hit If, after seeing a who’s who of Silicon Valley executives at President Trump’s inauguration in January, you believed it was going to be the Year of Big Tech, you’d be wrong — at least so far. Instead, four of the five major tech companies represented at the inauguration — Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have seen their share prices take a noticeable hit to start 2025. Only Meta, who was represented by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has seen its share price climb this year. Here’s how those companies have performed on Wall Street since the start of the year, by mid-morning on Tuesday: — Meta: up 4.7% — Apple: down 1.9% — Amazon: down 9.6% — Alphabet: down 11.8% — Tesla: down 30% Tesla, as seen above, has been particularly hard-hit in 2025. CEO Elon Musk has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency for President Trump, as both are aiming to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal bureaucracy. Musk’s time spent away from his electric car company has upset some investors, who are calling for him to spend more time on Tesla and less time on DOGE. Reports of softening sales in China have not helped, either, although Tesla bulls are pointing to revamped models, the expansion of its self-driving technology and the launch of its $20,000 Optimus robots as reasons to be optimistic. From a macro standpoint, the market has taken a downturn recently, with many analysts saying the tariffs imposed by President Trump have been a key driver of the dip. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. The Wall Street slide for the major tech companies stands out, after Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos literally stood behind the president on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Many Trump fans who attended the inauguration told TheWrap they were skeptical of Big Tech’s sudden embrace of Trump, aside from Musk, whom the crowd overwhelmingly seemed to like. Now, it will be worth watching to see if investors remain skeptical of the market, or if they are “buying the dip” on these Big Tech stocks.

Title: Stocks fall in early trading as Trump tariffs take effect

The Trump administration's long-promised tariffs took hold on Tuesday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the Trump administration’s long-promised tariffs took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 670 points, or 1.5%; while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.3%. The policy taxes imports from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could raise prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones. Shares of retail giant Target fell 3% on Tuesday, following an earnings release from the company that cited "tariff uncertainty" as a potential impediment for the business. Walmart's stock price dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, while Amazon shares inched down 0.6%. Shares of Best Buy plummeted more than 13%. The sharp drop came after Best Buy CEO told analysts that price increases are "highly likely" as a result of the tariffs. Higher costs for car production could also pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Shares of Ford tumbled nearly 3% on Tuesday, while General Motors dropped about 4.5%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler -- saw shares decline more than 4%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, saw its stock price drop about 4.5%. The far-reaching losses extend a market slide that began on Monday afternoon when Trump affirmed plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs. Trump stuck to a March 4 start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The duties also raise input costs for manufacturers that import raw materials. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, the tariffs appeared to impact some of the other so-called "Magnificent Seven," a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, suffered a 2% drop in its stock price. Apple, which makes some of its products in China, fell nearly 1%. Shares of Microsoft defied the trend, however, remaining essentially unchanged on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia, which relies on semiconductors from Taiwan but also imports some materials from Mexico, saw shares increase about 1.5%. Alphabet's stock price climbed about 2%.

Title: Ray-Ban and Meta just teased new limited-edition smart glasses – but they'll be in frustratingly short supply

Ray-Ban and Meta have another 3,600 pairs of clear specs on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has announced that new “limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta glasses” are set to land this month, with promo images suggesting they’ll be transparent just like the previous limited-edition design it launched – but expect them to be even harder to get your hands on. Beyond a look at the Ray-Ban logo on a clear-ish frame that shows off the hardware inside the smart specs, we know relatively little about the design. The previous clear frames used the Wayfarer frame type, but this new run could get the Skyler or Headliner design, which have more rounded lenses, although our money is on a bold new design like the frames A$AP Rocky – Ray-Ban’s new Creative Director – just unveiled at Milan Fashion Week – which would tally with the “straight from the runway” comment in Meta’s promotional material for the new limited-edition specs. We also don’t know if these specs will come with the same limited-edition black case as the previous edition, instead of the standard brown, though we hope they do. Adding to the list of unknown is that Meta has yet to reveal a price. Given that the previous limited model cost $429 – which is about $100 more than the standard translucent frames – we expect this new design will also be pricier than standard Ray-Ban smart glasses, and perhaps even pricier than the previous limited design. We say that because while Meta’s last limited run consisted of 7,500 pairs, this time it’s only making 3,600 – at least, that’s what '0001/3600' printed on the frames in the promo image on its website is suggesting. Given the even more limited supply, Meta may choose to bump the price up, so if you’re keen to pick up a pair for yourself you’ll want to act fast when they drop. There's no precise release date to mark on your calendars, though there is a 'Notify me' button on the website if you want to get an update when the glasses go live –just be prepared to go home empty handed. Scalpers are showing that they’re still in full force in 2025 by ruining limited drops for tech, and there’s a good chance they’ll strike again here. There may also be scammers around looking to take advantage of the hype if stock does run dry – so be careful buying glasses claiming to be the limited edition Ray-Bans from unofficial stores and resellers.

Title: Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality: Navigating the New Frontier of ETFs
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/liquid-promises-illiquid-reality-navigating-the-new-frontier-of-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T00:36:11Z
Full Content:
In the investment world, there’s an old saying: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Yet the latest crop of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering both daily liquidity and exposure to illiquid assets might seem to promise just that—a financial equivalent of eating decadent cheesecake without gaining an ounce. Alternately: we keep waiting for The Wizard to save us. The investment industry has traditionally maintained strict guardrails between liquid public markets and illiquid private investments. This separation wasn’t arbitrary—it reflected a fundamental reality that illiquid investments, by their very nature, cannot be quickly converted to cash without significant price concessions. Regulations limiting illiquid investments in publicly traded funds weren’t designed to deprive “regular” investors of opportunities, but rather to protect them from risks they might not fully comprehend or be equipped to handle. We’ve been here before. History provides sobering lessons. In some cases, arrogance, overconfidence, and groupthink led to stunning levels of concentration in portfolios. The Fairholme Fund today has 74% of its portfolio in a single company, St. Joe. Bruce Berkowitz was Morningstar manager of the decade for 2000-10 but they dropped coverage of the fund in 2021, giving it a score of 100+ on their risk gauge, and note that its category rank has been either in the top 1% or bottom 1% of its peer group for seven of the past eight years. The Sequoia Fund not only sunk 36% of its portfolio in a single sketchy stock, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, but its public statements began parroting the Valeant CEO’s. We reported “the dark version of the Sequoia narrative” in 2016: Goldfarb, abetted by an analyst, became obsessed about Valeant and crushed any internal dissent. Mr. Poppe, nominally Mr. Goldfarb’s peer, wouldn’t or couldn’t stop the disaster. “All the directors had repeatedly expressed concern” over the size of the Valeant stake and the decision to double down on it. Mr. Poppe dismissed their concerns: “recent events frustrated them.” The subsequent resignations by 40% of the board, with another apparently threatening to go, were inconsequential annoyances. Sequoia, rather snippily, noted that board members don’t control the portfolio, the managers do. Foot firmly on the gas, they turned the bus toward the cliff. More recently our colleague Devesh Shah reported that Texas Public Land Corporation comprised 47% of the total holdings of Horizon Kinetics, advisor to the various Kinetics Funds. (Morningstar subsequently picked up on the story albeit without acknowledging Devesh’s work.) As of 3/1/25, Kinetics Paradigm has 66% of its portfolio in TPL and its sibling Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities sits at 53%. Both have perfectly splendid total returns coupled with Morningstar risk scores of 100+. Freakishly Morningstar has endorsed both, awarding them a Bronze analyst rating. The most spectacular blow-ups have resulted from the confidence that star managers can magically turn illiquid investments into liquid ones. Consider Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC), which offered public investors access to pre-IPO tech companies. What seemed revolutionary quickly turned problematic as the fund frequently traded at substantial discounts to its net asset value (NAV)—sometimes exceeding 30%. Why? Because investors couldn’t be certain of the true value of its holdings, creating a persistent trust deficit. The fund posted annualized losses of 75% over the past three years and 60% over the past five. It now trades at $0.06/share and can’t even manage to liquidate. If you’re interested in the cautionary tale of the giant that tumbled, read “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund” (March 2025). More dramatically, the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund‘s collapse in 2015 demonstrates how quickly illiquidity can transform from theoretical to catastrophic. In 2016, we described it this way: …offered the impossible: it would invest in illiquid securities but provide investors with daily liquidity. That worked fine as long as the market was rising and no one actually wanted their money back, but when the tide began to go out and investors wanted their money, the poop hit the propeller. When redemptions accelerated, the fund couldn’t sell its junk bonds fast enough and ultimately had to bar investors from withdrawing their money—the ultimate liquidity failure. The fund froze redemptions and placed the fund in a locked trust. Investors exploded, and lawsuits followed, as did a $14.25 million payment from two Third Avenue executives. It took investors three years to receive, drip by drop, 84% of their investment back. Third Avenue was gutted. Despite these cautionary tales, a new generation of funds is testing the boundaries: Franklin Global Allocation Fund has ventured into business development companies, a relatively modest step into less-liquid territory. Effective on February 5, 2025, the fund gained the option of investing in business development companies, “BDCs are a less common type of closed-end fund [which] typically invest in small, developing, financially troubled, private companies or other companies that may have value that can be realized over time, often with managerial assistance.” At around the same time, its management team turned over, leading Morningstar to place its status as “under review.” The fund has seen continuous outflows essentially every single month for a decade with annual returns in the 5-7% range. Adding the ability to goose returns with a new asset class makes business sense; adding illiquid assets and a new team is grounds for caution. SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF pushes further by investing in private credit markets. Described as “ground-breaking” by Morningstar, the ETF will give investors exposure to illiquid private credit in a liquid vehicle. Up to 35% of the portfolio can be illiquid debt. The plan is for the fund to buy private credit from Apollo with the promise the Apollo will also promise to help them cover their … uhh, exposure. Morningstar’s Brian Moriarty explains: The ETF plans to overcome those concerns through a contractual agreement with Apollo, which will supply private-credit assets for the fund to buy and provide it with bids, or prices, on those same assets. Apollo has further agreed to purchase those investments from the fund up to an undefined daily limit. In other words, Apollo is selling these instruments to the fund and promising to buy them back at the request of State Street. (“A Groundbreaking New ETF Arrives,” Morningstar.com, 2/27/25). Pretty much no one but the adviser is sanguine about these promises. Mr. Moriarty frets “If redemptions are greater than Apollo’s daily limit and the ETF has few public securities, there are many more questions that the filing doesn’t answer… the filing makes it clear that ‘assets that were deemed liquid by the Adviser may become illiquid’ if Apollo is unable to provide a bid or unable to purchase those assets.” One day later the SEC belatedly located its Big Boy Pants and told the adviser to file an amended plan. In a letter to the firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that the fund had “significant remaining outstanding issues” around its liquidity, name, and ability to comply with valuation rules. That’s in part because the SEC accepted a filing with key information blacked-out, or redacted. “We have concerns,” associate director Brent Fields announced. (Tania Mitra, “After launch, SEC raises concerns about State Street and Apollo’s private credit ETF,” Citywire, 2/28/25). ERShares Private-Public Crossover (XOVR) makes perhaps the boldest move by including private equity investments like SpaceX and it’s drawn the attention of two really smart, very different people, Jason Zweig and Jeff Ptak. Both start with the same observation: XOVR’s claim to fame is that it owns a chunk of Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX and it markets that fact relentlessly. The biggest question, though, is “How big a chunk do they own?” The honest answer to which is “sheet, I dunno” because SpaceX is privately traded and its price is anybody’s (and sometimes everybody’s) guess. The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Zweig launched on the fund in January, doing what Mr. Z. does best: he gets to the point quickly, clearly, and with great style. He reports on the possible current worth of one share of SpaceX: private firms variously put it at $115, $182, $185, $207, or $209. Which is accurate? As Mr. Z. puts it “who knows?” Equally troubling is what happens if the bubble starts to deflate: “in a market crash, XOVR would have to sell its most liquid holdings, such as Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Oracle, to meet redemptions if investors panicked. That might leave remaining shareholders owning little but SpaceX—which isn’t readily tradable.” The fund advisor fumbled about every query placed to it, leaving The Z to conclude, “If the investment industry wants to sell private assets to the public, it had better do better than this—a lot better.” (You Can Own Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But at What Price? WSJ.com, 1/24/25) Similarly, Morningstar’s Jeff Ptak did what he does best in his analysis of the fund, “How to Manage an ETF … Right Into a Corner” (2/25/25). The short version: Mr. P. analyzes more data, more carefully, and more extensively, than the firm’s own auditors might have. He notes that “Capital Impact Advisors, added private equity to its mandate last year and has heavily promoted it as ‘the first crossover ETF’ to invest in private equity in the months since.” The marketing worked (“Around 80% of the new money that’s flowed into the ETF since November has arrived after Dec. 10, 2024, when Capital Impact Advisors marked the SpaceX position up from $135 to $185 per share. It’s remained at that valuation ever since.”) The problem, he notes, is that this money could head for the exits just as quickly as it rushed in. In hopes of preventing that, the managers might double down on illiquid positions or might face a huge burden in liquidating a partially illiquid portfolio. It’s a good piece of analysis, and quite detailed. Each represents a different position on the liquidity-illiquidity spectrum, with potentially different risk profiles. As Mr. Moriarty modestly observes, “This is a groundbreaking proposal that could open the door for a multitude of copycat vehicles… It’s a wide new ETF world out there.” The core issue isn’t just illiquidity itself but the misalignment between asset liquidity and fund structure. When a fund promises daily redemptions while holding assets that might take weeks, months, or years to sell at reasonable prices, it creates a structural vulnerability. This disconnect is like promising instant sobriety after a night of drinking—it violates fundamental realities. During market stress, this mismatch becomes particularly dangerous as funds may be forced to sell their most liquid holdings first, leaving remaining investors with an increasingly illiquid portfolio. These new ETFs aren’t offering the impossible—they’re offering a trade-off. The appropriate metaphor isn’t “alcohol without hangovers” but rather “alcohol with a hangover cure that might work.” The cure isn’t guaranteed, especially if too many people need it at once. Smart investors understand that innovative financial products don’t eliminate fundamental trade-offs—they merely repackage them in ways that might obscure the underlying risks. The promise of private market returns with public market liquidity should be approached not with excitement but with heightened scrutiny. Because in investing, as in life, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

Title: The Weakening Economy Needs Rate Relief

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone , Contributor. Equity markets were down for the week (again). But it could have been much worse, as the closing results were much improved from Friday’s lows at about 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500, for example, finished the day with a +2% gain as markets rallied into the close.[1] As shown in the table, 2025 has been mixed with the S&P 500 and the DJIA positive while the tech heavy Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 are negative for the year. Equity Market Uncertainty is clearly the order of the day (Trump vs. Zelenskyy, DOGE’s actions to terminate thousands of federal jobs, the imposition of tariffs beginning March 5). It has now appeared to have permeated and soured investor views. The volatility the markets just experienced oftentimes marks a turn in investor attitudes. According to Rosenberg Research, only 29 other times over the last 9000-plus trading sessions have we seen the intraday volatility that occurred on Friday (February 28).[1] The other occasions occurred in 2022, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998. Some of these years were years of Recession. Magnificent 7 Despite showing strong sales and profits (+80%) and guiding higher, Nvidia’s stock still got pummeled, down -7% for the week and about the same year-to-date.[1] It isn’t every day that a tech titan comes in with such good numbers and its share price tanks. A look at the Mag 7 in total shows lower prices across the board for the week and for six out of the seven on a year-to-date basis (Meta being the exception). Could it be that the markets see a slowing economy? Or has the market just run too far? So far in 2025, all the housing data have tanked. Pending Home Sales Most analysts blame these downtrends on high interest rates. But, as shown in the chart below, mortgage rates have been at or near 7% since late 2022; so, something else must be at play. Perhaps the slowdown in the general economy is the culprit. 30 Year Mortgage Rate The weakening economy, high mortgage rates, and the perception by consumers that inflation will continue to be an issue, has taken its toll. The chart shows that consumers still see many hurdles to overcome in the home buying process. Buying Conditions for Houses Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose +22,000 in the week ended February 22 to 242,000 from 220,000 the prior week.[1] Continuing Claims, at 2,234,000 are nearly +101,000 higher than a year ago.[2] Due to the DOGE purges in D.C., these numbers will certainly rise sharply over the next few months. Depending on how rapidly the economy slows, we expect the U3 unemployment rate to rise to somewhere between 4.5% and 5.0% over the next six months. Inflation is a process. It isn’t “high prices.” Those “high prices” are the result of inflation. One cause of inflation that economists and the folks who run the Fed worry about is something called the “wage-price” spiral. Simply put, this is where rising wages cause businesses to raise prices which in turn leads to demands for higher wages. Wage Growth & The Quits Rate The chart shows the year/year wage and salary growth rate (blue line) and a smoothed version of the JOLTS “Quits Rate.” Note the strong relationship. When the Quits Rate falls, so does the rate of wage growth. That seems logical. The Quits Rate falls when employers cut back on hiring and jobs become harder to find. The Conference Board’s latest Consumer Confidence Survey complements this chart, showing a rise in the consumer view that jobs are now harder to get than they were just a few months ago. Also in that Survey, the view that there will be fewer jobs over the next six months hit a 12-year high. Generally, we find such views in a slowing economy. Hence, our view that inflation will be at or below the Fed’s target by mid-year. The University of Michigan’s most recent Consumer Sentiment Survey hit its lowest level since November 2023. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months spiked to 3.5% in December.[1] This is the highest level for this indicator since April 1995. No doubt the tariff threats from the Trump administration played a key role. Just for clarity, the tariffs will have an initial impact on inflation, but economists believe that it is a one-time adjustment and doesn’t feed the inflation process. This is a problem the Fed is going to have to deal with and it is likely why markets don’t see any rate decreases for several months. Policy uncertainty has had a large impact on the equity markets. “Tariffs On,” “Tariffs Off.” Which will it be? March 5 appears to be the destiny date. If the tariffs are actually imposed, expect more equity market volatility as that will be another hurdle for the economy. There is no doubt that the U.S. economy is slowing. This appears to be a worldwide phenomenon as the economies of China and those in Europe are slowing, too. In the U.S., we’ve recently seen a decline in Retail Sales, and we know that it isn’t a one-off because Walmart gave very soft guidance. Housing is the poster child for the economic slowdown. The latest housing data screams Recession. And the latest consumer confidence surveys have all turned negative. High interest rates are killing the housing sector. New and Existing Home Sales continue to slow. Because inflation expectations are stuck at levels higher than the Fed’s target rates, the prospect of much needed interest rate relief still appears to be several months away. Our view is that the Fed is already behind the curve, and if they wait until the inflation indexes actually hit their 2% goal before granting rate relief, the economy will already be in Recession. Remember, interest rates impact the economy with long and variable lags. This Fed’s mindset: “No rate relief until the inflation numbers yield.” But if it waits much longer, it will be too late. In fact, it may have already waited too long. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: 19 Low-Cost Marketing Ideas for Small Retail Businesses

Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:26:26Z

Navigating the realm of marketing on a tight budget can be daunting for small retail businesses. This article demystifies the process, offering proven low-cost strategies and invaluable insights from seasoned industry experts. Discover how to leverage digital tools and innovative techniques to maximize marketing impact with minimal expenditure. Email marketing platforms can cost as little as $10-$50 a month, and they remain one of the best low-cost tools for driving repeat sales. Unlike social media, where reach is unpredictable even with paid ads, email gives businesses a direct, owned channel to engage their current customer base while also reaching new prospects. Brick-and-mortar retailers and ecommerce businesses who collect email addresses at checkout and through their website with strategically placed prompts can segment their users to send targeted promotions, abandoned cart reminders, and loyalty discounts—all of which improve retention and customer lifetime value (CLV). Automated sequences are also a great help for small businesses especially, so they can stay top-of-mind without requiring constant manual effort. Spending under $100 a month on a reliable email platform allows smaller retailers to build customer relationships that drive long-term revenue, rather than relying solely on new customer acquisition. It’s a small cost with major upsides. Teresha Aird, Cofounder & CMO, Offices.net If you’re running a small retail business, optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) profile isn’t optional, it’s a must. When people search for a local store, they’re not scrolling through Instagram ads or watching TikToks. They’re pulling out their phone, typing “best bakery near me,” and clicking on the first few results. If your GMB profile isn’t fully optimized, you’re leaving money on the table and losing potential customers to competitors. Most small businesses set up their profile once and forget about it. That’s like opening a store and never changing the window display. Google prioritizes businesses that stay active, post weekly updates, respond to every review, and upload high-quality photos. Want to take it to the next level? For $100 or less, tools like Whitespark or BrightLocal can help you build local citations to improve your GMB ranking and visibility. The higher you rank, the more foot traffic you’ll get, turning Google into a free customer acquisition machine. Alex Martkovich, Founder, New Digital One low-cost but high-impact marketing expense under $100/month that small retail businesses should absolutely invest in? A geo-fenced Wi-Fi marketing tool like SpotOn WiFi or Zenreach. Most small businesses overlook this, but your store’s Wi-Fi is a goldmine for customer data and repeat visits. Instead of offering free Wi-Fi with no strings attached, use a Wi-Fi marketing tool to capture customer emails and phone numbers automatically when they log in. Once you have that data, you can retarget them with personalized offers, flash sales, and loyalty perks. Here’s a specific way to make this work: One small café I worked with spent $60/month on a Wi-Fi marketing tool and, within 3 months, grew their customer email list by over 2,000 contacts. More importantly, they saw a 14% increase in repeat visits just by sending simple, automated discount offers to Wi-Fi users. For under $100/month, this is a no-brainer for small retail businesses that want to turn one-time visitors into loyal, repeat customers—without spending a dime on ads. Priyanka Prajapati, Digital Marketer, BrainSpate For small retail businesses, I’ve found GoHighlevel’s $97 monthly subscription to be transformative for lead management. After implementing it in my own business, our lead capture effectiveness doubled within the first month. What really surprised me was how quickly we mastered the platform—we started with basic follow-up sequences but soon graduated to sophisticated multi-channel campaigns that previously would have cost thousands through an agency. The game-changer came when we added Yext integration for an additional $30. This simple add-on automatically synchronized our business listings across multiple platforms, creating the consistent online presence that Google algorithms love. Within three months, our local search rankings improved significantly, and we started seeing a steady stream of new customers who found us through various online directories—all maintaining perfectly consistent business information. TJ Rao, Marketing & Sales Consultant, Zevesto Property Group One unconventional yet highly effective marketing spend for a small retail business is advertising on a navigation app like Waze Local. This is a digital, location-based channel that many small businesses overlook, but it can drive real-world traffic to your store for under $100 per month. Waze Local places your business as a pin on the map or a promoted search result for nearby drivers—essentially a digital billboard that reaches customers in your vicinity at the perfect time (when they’re already on the road). You can get started for as little as $2 a day (~$60/month) on Waze Local’s Starter plan. This yields branded pins on the map and search ads in the app without breaking the bank. Even at this modest budget, you’re tapping into Waze’s massive user base of drivers in your area, gaining exposure on a platform with 100+ million users. Waze Local is specifically designed to drive customers into brick-and-mortar stores, not just website clicks. For example, a retail boutique or coffee shop can appear as a branded pin urging nearby drivers to “make a quick stop” at your store. During beta tests, small businesses using Waze Local saw a 20.4% jump in monthly in-store visits on average—a clear, measurable increase in foot traffic attributable to this channel. Marc Lefton, Fractional CMO, Marc Lefton A small business can run effective Google Ads for as little as 3 to 5 dollars a day. That’s about 90 to 150 dollars a month, but if you cap your daily budget and stay laser-focused on local searches, you can keep it under 100. Take a coffee shop for example. You target searches like “coffee near me” within a one-mile radius. If the average cost per click is somewhere between 0.50 and 1 dollar, that gives you 3 to 6 clicks a day. And these aren’t just random clicks. These are people standing on the street, phone in hand, actively looking for coffee. You don’t need fancy campaigns. Just a simple ad with a strong call to action like, “Fresh coffee, one block away,” and a link to directions. Keep it running and you’ll see steady foot traffic without burning through cash. If you want another option under 100, look at boosting local posts on Facebook and Instagram. A well-placed 5-dollar post can hit thousands of people nearby. Or go for an email marketing tool like Mailchimp. For 10 to 20 dollars a month, you stay in your customers’ inboxes and keep them coming back. Nick Spivak, Head of Business Development, IT Monks One marketing expense that costs less than $100 a month but is invaluable for a small retail business is a well-optimized Google Business Profile (GBP) with a local SEO tool like BrightLocal or Whitespark (both under $100/month). Having a free Google Business Profile is essential, but optimizing it properly with consistent updates, customer reviews, and local keywords can significantly improve visibility in search results. A tool like BrightLocal helps track local rankings, manage reviews efficiently, and find citation opportunities—all of which improve local search performance. For under $100, a business can: Local searches often have high intent—when someone searches “best bakery near me,” they’re ready to buy. A well-optimized GBP can drive in-store visits and direct calls without spending a fortune on ads. Investing in local SEO isn’t just about rankings—it’s about making sure potential customers find you at the right moment. Dhiren Mulani, SEO Specialist, Earningify.com Email marketing is like the Swiss Army knife of marketing tools—simple, effective, and versatile. For less than $100 a month, small retail businesses should invest in an email automation platform. We helped a local business boost repeat sales by 18% by setting up automated follow-up emails after purchases. Platforms like Mailchimp or ConvertKit make this easy. Getting the timing and personalization right took a few tweaks. Once we did, the results spoke for themselves. Katja Breitwieser, Digital Marketing Specialist, SocialSellinator A small retail shop seeking a savvy marketing investment of less than $100 per month should definitely invest in a social media scheduling and analytics tool such as Later, Buffer, or Metricool. Social media posting is consistent, but nobody wants to use their whole day trying to remember to press “publish”—particularly when there are a million other things to do. Why it’s a no-brainer: Turns guesswork into strategy—Rather than posting randomly and hoping for the best, businesses gain valuable insight into what’s actually working. For the price of a few fancy lattes a month, small businesses receive an automated system that keeps their brand alive online while they concentrate on managing their store. At a minimum, it eliminates that “Oops, I forgot to post today” panic at closing time. Ben Schreiber, CMO, Latico Leather Google Workspace is hands down the best sub-$100 investment a retail business can make, starting at just $7/month per user. Let me tell you why this isn’t just about email—though that’s a crucial part. Microsoft 365 is also great, but I will stick with Google. First, let’s talk about email credibility. Using a generic @gmail.com, @aol.com, or, worse, an email from your website host is playing business roulette. I’ve seen too many business owners lose important client communications to spam folders or face deliverability issues because they tried to save a few dollars with basic email solutions. A professional email (@yourbusiness.com) through Google Workspace instantly boosts your credibility. But here’s what makes it a no-brainer investment: Think about it: For less than what most businesses spend on coffee each month, you get a professional email system that won’t fail you during crucial business moments, plus a full suite of tools that would cost significantly more if purchased separately. This isn’t just about having a professional email address—it’s about having a reliable, secure, and professional business communication system that grows with your business. Oliver Moreno, CEO / Founder, Bright Click For a small retail business with a $100 monthly marketing budget, I highly recommend investing $5 per day in Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram) with hyper-local targeting. By focusing on people within your business’s location, you can increase brand awareness and attract nearby customers who are more likely to visit and make a purchase. This strategy has worked exceptionally well for many small businesses I’ve helped, as it ensures consistent visibility without breaking the bank. Even with a small budget, local engagement and foot traffic can significantly improve, making it a cost-effective investment worth trying. Shubham Ahuja, Digital Marketing Manager, DigiLawyer Email marketing-hands down. For less than $100 a month, a small retail business can use platforms like Mailchimp or Klaviyo to stay in front of customers, drive repeat sales, and build real relationships. Here is why I think you should invest in email marketing: You own your audience. Unlike social media, where algorithms decide who sees your content, email goes straight to your customers. It keeps customers coming back. A simple monthly newsletter with new arrivals, special offers, or helpful tips keeps your business top of mind. Automation does the work for you. Set up abandoned cart emails, welcome sequences, and birthday discounts—so you’re making sales while you sleep. I think email marketing hands down is the best way to spend a couple hundred bucks a month. Justin Schulze, Digital Marketing Expert, Schulze Creative Stock photography—or even expertly generated AI graphics—is one of the most valuable marketing investments a small retail business can make for under $100 a month. While AI-generated text can enhance efficiency, compelling visuals are what stop the scroll and grab attention on social media. You have a split second to engage your audience, and high-quality images or graphics make all the difference in whether they pause to read your content or keep scrolling. Investing in a stock photography subscription or an AI-powered design tool ensures that your brand always has professional, eye-catching visuals to support your messaging. Kelly Nuckolls, CMO, Jeskell Systems If you run a small retail shop, one marketing move under $100 that’s absolutely worth it is optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) and running small Facebook/Instagram ads. GMB is free—everyone knows that—but just creating a listing won’t do much. To actually get results, upload fresh photos, collect reviews, and use the right categories so your business ranks higher in local searches. A friend of mine had a small bakery that only locals knew about. After optimizing his GMB and running just $50 in Facebook ads, new customers started finding him through Google. Relying only on word-of-mouth makes growth too slow, but this simple step brought in real business. If you have less than $100 to spend on marketing, this is one of the smartest moves you can make. Anshul Rana, Top Rated Plus Technical SEO Expert, The Digital Geek If you run a small retail business, your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the #1 tool for driving foot traffic, phone calls, and online orders—and it’s free to set up. But to maximize its impact, a small monthly investment in Local SEO tools can be a game-changer. Google Business Profile Management ($0 – $100/month) – If you don’t have time to consistently update your GBP, a local SEO expert or GBP management tool (like BrightLocal or Moz Local) ensures your listings are optimized, accurate, and actively engaging customers. Review & Reputation Management ($50 – $99/month) – Services like GatherUp or Podium help automate 5-star review collection, monitor customer feedback, and improve online trust—critical for converting local shoppers. Google Search Console (FREE) – Your Hidden Keyword Tool – Many small businesses overlook Google Search Console (GSC) as a powerful, free keyword research tool. It shows what real customers are searching for before they land on your website, helping you refine product descriptions, blog content, and marketing strategies to match what people are already looking for. Mitch Cornell, Founder/CEO, Webmasons Marketing If you’re a small retail business and not using CapCut to create content for TikTok and Instagram, you’re missing out big time. Social media isn’t just a marketing channel anymore; it’s how brands are built. People don’t just want products; they want stories, experiences, and personalities. Look at Logan’s Candies, a small-town candy shop that now has lines stretching down the street. Why? Because their TikTok videos showcasing handmade candy-pulling went viral, turning their shop into a destination. That’s the power of social-driven foot traffic. We see this firsthand—we handle the finances for brands that are scaling through TikTok, Instagram, and social-driven sales. The businesses embracing social commerce—showcasing their products, process, and personality online—are the ones thriving. CapCut makes high-quality content ridiculously easy. Auto-captions, trending templates, seamless transitions, it’s a pro-level editing tool without the learning curve. And it’s free (or dirt cheap for premium). Retailers who get this? They’re the ones with lines out the door. The ones who don’t? They’re still waiting for customers to just “walk in.” Sam Hoye, Founder, Social Commerce Accountants One low-cost marketing tactic that proved incredibly effective for small businesses we partner with was utilizing products such as banners, A-stands, and graphics. These high-visibility solutions significantly boosted traffic and sales. They grabbed the attention of potential customers, creating a lasting brand presence in both local and high-traffic areas. The key to this success was the perfect combination of eye-catching designs and strategic placement, allowing businesses to reach a larger audience without a major financial commitment. It is a simple yet powerful way to set any business apart. Michael Cheban, Co-Chief Executive Officer, SignCore When small retail businesses consider their marketing budget, they typically think about social media ads, email campaigns, or local promotions. However, there’s one investment that delivers exceptional ROI while flying under the radar: AI-powered pricing software. For less than $100 a month, this tool can transform your business fundamentals more dramatically than any traditional marketing expense. Think about the core equation of retail: Sales = Quantity x Price. Most small businesses focus exclusively on the quantity side—spending countless hours and dollars trying to attract more customers. Yet they neglect the price component, which can often be optimized with much less effort and investment. A small change in your pricing strategy can immediately impact your bottom line across every single transaction, making it arguably the most leveraged marketing investment available. Nabeel Siddiqi, CEO, Moksha AI LLC Showing yourself on Instagram and LinkedIn costs your time, which can be very valuable indeed. However, the integration costs nothing, so take the time to be consistent, let potential clients see you and how you work. If people hire who they know/like/trust, then take the first step and let them know you! Emily Mcclure, Owner, EM Corporate It’s clear that for a small investment, your retail business can make a big splash online. Get started today and beging growing your local small business.

Title: Meta Quest 3 vs Pico 4 Ultra: Which VR headset should you buy?

Two of the biggest standalone VR headsets are about to do battle When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We're living in the age of standalone, mixed reality headsets, and with lots of brands getting in on the fun it's getting more and more important to be armed with the knowledge of which one is right for you. Unless you have thousands to splash out on one, there are two rivals duking it out for the top spot, the Pico 4 Ultra, and the Meta Quest 3. Squaring off for this Saturday night blockbuster fight are two headsets that can offer a lot of versatility. Whether you just want one of the best VR headsets for immersive gaming, you want spatial computing power, or you want a fun new way to enjoy some you-time without distractions, the Pico 4 Ultra and Meta Quest 3 are great products for you to consider. Although the Meta Quest 3 is much more commonly known, you shouldn't count the underdog out early. The Pico 4 isn't available in US markets, so that does take it out of contention for a lot of readers. Still, if you're anywhere else in the world, the Pico 4 Ultra is an extremely formidable opponent for Meta's Quest 3, and may even top it in certain aspects. There's a multi-round battle ahead of us, so grab your popcorn and get ready for a classic. Zuck's Meta Quest 3 is off to a raring start, as we all suspected. The Pico 4 Ultra just hasn't turned up in this opening round. Since the Quest 3 is available at so many retailers in the US and UK, it's the clear winner here. The Pico 4 Ultra is available in the UK though, and although I've seen it dip out of stock just once since its release, I'd say it's probably the harder of the two headsets to come across. As it continues to age, the Quest 3 is likely to get more discounts, bundles, and deals too. Let's not forget that the Meta Quest 3 comes in a few different variations too. The Pico 4 Ultra has one 256GB SKU, whereas the Quest 3 has its 512GB model, the 3S 128GB model, and the 3S 256GB model as well. The Quest 3 did have a more affordable 128GB version, but that's since been discontinued now that the 3S headsets are here. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Winner: Meta Quest 3 This is the round where things get interesting. After a near knockout in that first round, Pico 4 Ultra seems to have woken up, and we've got a real fight on our hands. On paper, the Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra have very similar specs. They both share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which in fighting terms is equivalent to having the same coach. In short, you're going to get very similar experiences with both of these devices, and there isn't much that separates them. Pico 4 Ultra Meta Quest 3 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Resolution 2160 x 2160 per eye 2064 x 2208 per eye Refresh rate 90Hz Variable - 72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz Field of View 105 degrees 110 degrees Sensors iTOF Depth sensor, Two MR cameras RGB cameras, 4 IR cameras Lenses Pancake Pancake Display 2 x LCD 2 x LCD Storage 256GB 512GB Cameras 2 x 32MB cameras 2x RGB 18PPD cameras Audio Integrated speakers Integrated 3D spatial audio speakers RAM 12GB LPDDR5 8GB Weight 580g 515g Eye Tracking None None Battery 5700mAh (2-4 hours depending on use) Up to 2.2 hours average Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, USB-C WiFi 6E, USB-C As you can see, it's a very close match-up to call between these two headsets. The tale of the tape has a lot of back and forth and a lot of things that are virtually the same, or cancel one another out. The Pico 4 Ultra has strengths in its Wi-Fi 7 support which means it'll be faster to install games and content. It also has 12GB of RAM up from 8GB in the Quest 3, which arguably futureproofs it more for more demanding VR games that have larger levels. RAM is really important in terms of VR computing power, so that's a huge win to have. The Pico 4 also does a great job of its crystal clear cameras and room tracking thanks to a depth sensor the Quest 3 doesn't have. The Quest 3 has more versatility when it comes to refresh rate, since depending on the application and what feels right for you, you can vary the frame rate of the headset from 72Hz to 90Hz, or even 120Hz. 110 degrees of horizontal field of view feels like a cheap win over the Pico 4 Ultra's 105, but it is a slight disparity. Storage also sits in the Quest 3's corner, although I'd argue this is less of a win in VR, since applications and games take up such a small amount of space compared to flat-screen games. Whatever Meta's been doing with audio has paid off though, and a big win for the Quest 3 comes in its quality of sound. While weight technically goes in Meta's favor too, I'd argue it's one of the specs that's virtually identical, for reasons I'll come onto. This is a tough round to call, but I think the wins that Pico 4 Ultra has in terms of its spec sheet are more significant strikes than the ones the Quest 3 can land. It's more about futureproofing in this arena, and the 12GB of RAM and increased Wi-Fi speed do make a big difference. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra (but not by much) If there's one disparity on the spec table that makes no sense, it's that the Meta Quest 3 weighs less than the Pico 4 Ultra. That's because the Pico 4 Ultra is designed to sit so comfortably on your face, and the way it distributes its weight across your head deserves a lot of credit. Longer sessions fly by while wearing this device, and that's down to some excellent design. A lot of that comes down to the fact that Pico's headstrap is much more substantial than Meta's. It reminds me of the one used for the Meta Quest Pro, and it feels like better value for money than the very simple material strap you get with the Quest 3. On the other hand, the best Meta Quest accessories do allow you to personalize your device to suit the comfort and weight distribution you'd like, so it's not a total walkover in this round. I'd argue this is a nice parry, but not an ideal counter since accessories demand more money on top of the headset. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra This one is another complicated round, and it's a bit of a shame, really. The Meta Quest 3 launched in October of 2023 and its 512GB SKU landed a lofty price tag of $649 / £619. The Pico 4 Ultra then launched just under a year later, and with a 256GB storage capacity that fit between the Quest 3's two models in price while touting some beefier specs. It launched to the tune of £529 in the UK, coming in comfortably under the Quest 3's larger 512 variant and making an excellent name for itself in the process. As an underdog, it really felt as though this was going to be a necessary move to win favor among VR shoppers who knew Meta's Quest brand well. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before things turned sour for Pico. The Quest 3S devices launched at $299 / £299 for 128GB, and $349 / £349 for 256GB. The Quest 3 128GB model was discontinued, and the 512GB Quest 3 received a price drop down to $499 / £469. It feels like a low blow has been struck to the underdog Pico 4 Ultra while the referee wasn't looking, and the Quest 3 has a smug look on its face as it walks back to the corner. Winner: Meta Quest 3 One of the biggest slights I hear against the Pico headsets is that they don't have access to the number of games that the Quest 3 has, and while that is true, it really isn't as bad as you think. A lot of the VR heavy hitters are still available on both headsets and if this is really a concern for you, maybe check to see if your favorite games are exclusive to one or the other before purchasing. You may find like I did, that the list the Pico 4 Ultra misses out on isn't actually that long. Both have access to Steam Link and can be hooked up to a gaming PC, so if you plan to tether to a beefier machine that can access SteamVR's library of games, both will do you just fine. Meta's Horizon OS does tend to be the first one to be thought of, however, so who knows what the future may hold as it likely continues to become the larger platform. Winner: Meta Quest 3 This one is slightly subjective, but from testing both headsets extensively and going through the process of reviewing them, I'd argue the Pico 4 Ultra is the better gaming device. It's a comfier headset that again, thanks to that weight distribution, extra RAM, and better depth sensing, makes immersive gaming experiences so much richer. There are fewer technical stutters that remind you you're running a standalone device through its paces, controllers track a bit more consistently, and in all honesty, I noticed more visual detail in Pico 4 Ultra games. At the same time, the visual fidelity on both headsets is virtually identical since their lenses, resolutions, displays, and FOVs are so close to one another. Meta Quest 3 has better passthrough quality since, for some reason, you can clearly read content on other screens better, but either will give you great passthrough quality. I'd say one of the big difference makers in this department is the controllers, which on the Pico 4 Ultra, are just that little bit better. They're marginally longer than the Quest 3 and have a few extra buttons, and it's amazing the difference this makes in games like Blade and Sorcery. Then again, the Quest 3 has some really polished hand-tracking features these days, if that's your thing. I think the motion trackers that come with Pico's device do add a lot more potential for immersive gaming experiences though. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra It's been an exhausting fight for the ages. Both combatants have come away bloody, beaten up, and bruised, and while neither has scored a decisive victory, there can only be one champion. I think the Pico 4 Ultra is, in a lot of ways, a better headset than the Quest 3. It feels a lot more tilted toward power users and those who want a futureproofed device that'll be able to run demanding VR games without compromise for years to come. It feels designed to counter some of the worst parts of the Quest 3. It's comfortable without the need for extra accessories, and its controllers aren't so small they lose tracking capability. Its software offering isn't as limited as some make it seem, and there's a lot of potential to use it in versatile ways, like any mixed-reality device today. It is hugely limited by its reluctance to enter the US market, however, and it's a shame we probably won't see a direct fight on the shelves between such close rivals. The Quest 3, thanks to its accessibly priced Quest 3S models, does a lot to bring VR technology into the mainstream limelight. In this day and age, it's the affordable, versatile, and genuinely capable VR device to own. In other words, the Quest 3 wins, but only because it had a home advantage.

Title: AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans

Time Published: 2025-03-03T05:01:00Z

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks. Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas. Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement. On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution. One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic. “You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.” Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality. The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation. Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise. “The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.” Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale. “It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said. On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.” DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels. Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns. So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube. One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers. “I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.” DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate. Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.” “It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.” Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out. Contextual adtech firms are focusing on signal loss fears, AI and brand safety to snare more clients. Across the board, there have been precipitous ad tech stock price declines, even if earnings are on the rise. WPP and Stagwell painted considerably different portraits of the future in the guidance they offered for the rest of 2025.

Title: The top wealth-creating stocks have put $21 trillion back into shareholders' pockets — and 3 are still cheap to buy
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-biggest-wealth-creators-decade-cheap-morningstar-2025-3

Past performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation. But that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars — like AI players — in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years. She also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever. In this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid. The list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value. However, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company. Nonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates. Microsoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending. Its fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply. Alphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business. Even as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. UnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud. Its stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes. However, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty. Jump to

Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past couple of years. Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem "with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets." The boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia. Nvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky and Priem. Personal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they "wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea." "We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help," he said. "It was fun." Their goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC. By 1999, the year it went public, Nvidia had invented the graphics processing unit, a computer chip that can handle many tasks simultaneously. It had faced challenges; it built two chips that failed, and it nearly went bankrupt. But it had also established itself as a formidable player in the industry, partnering with companies such as Sega, Dell, and Micron and winning rounds of funding from the venture firms Sequoia Capital and Sierra Ventures. In 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming. On Sequoia Capital's "Crucible Moments" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, "Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different." "We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another," he added. Nvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning. The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 800% from the start of 2023 to the start of 2025. Much of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models. Nvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO: Jensen Huang. A 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $110 billion. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. BI identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm. Huang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region. He attended a reform school in Kentucky. In an interview with NPR in 2012, he recalled that "the kids were really tough," adding: "They all had pocket knives — and when they get in fights, it's not pretty. Kids get hurt." He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion. Huang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984. During his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children: Madison Huang, a marketing director at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang, a senior product manager at the company. Jensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia. Huang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company. Nvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers. Nvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3. Demand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups. Last year, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips. But a key to Nvidia's success is CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years. Still, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In AMD's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024, CEO Lisa Su said the company had "closed a good part of" the gap with Nvidia. Nvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips. In January 2025, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft. Nvidia has been competing with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world. It briefly surpassed Apple to take the top spot numerous times in 2024 and again in January 2025, when its market capitalization reached $3.45 trillion. For the fiscal quarter that ended January 26, 2025, Nvidia's earnings call reported record revenue of $39.3 billion, up by 78% from the prior year. Net income for the quarter was more than $22.1 billion, up by 80% from the prior year. Nvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet. It has parks, "treehouses" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure. "When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible," Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023. It's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs "by definition" should have the most direct reports at a company. Huang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a "Jensen grilling." Nvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research. Landing a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.
