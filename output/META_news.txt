Title: Gemini's Raised IPO Range Indicates Strong Demand for New Crypto Stocks

The crypto exchange founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss looks poised to be the next hot crypto IPO. Gemini Space Station on Wednesday raised the range at which it expects its initial public offering to $24 to $26; it still plans to offer some 16.7 million shares, indicating a market capitalization over $3 billion at the high end. The boosted price suggests strong demand from investors for the shares and follows a string of successful public debuts that includes industry peers like stablecoin operator Circle (CRCL) and institution-focused digital assets platform Bullish (BLSH). The original range was estimated at $17 to $19 per share. Gemini Space Station is expected to list on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol "GEMI." Earlier this week, Gemini secured a $50 million private investment from another exchange operator, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a regulatory filling shows. Nasdaq agreed to pay a per share price equal to the IPO for Class A stock, less underwriting costs and commissions. The Winklevoss twins, famous for their role in the social media network once called Facebook, now known as Meta (META), are also earmarking a set of shares for retail investors. The company expects as much as 30% of Class A shares will be offered to individual investors via brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and SoFi (SOFI). Gemini operates one of the better-known crypto exchanges in the U.S. and also has a credit card business. While its trading volume is a fraction of the much larger Coinbase Global (COIN), the company said tokenization and card payments represent "immense untapped potential" for its future growth.

Title: Klarna employees roast its return-to-office plan with emojis as IPO hits the market

Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:52:56Z

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji. Klarna declined to comment. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

Title: Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone has some people excited, but Wall Street doesn't seem convinced
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/air-apple-new-iphone-wall-street-stock-price-tim-cook-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:41:05Z
Full Content:
Hiya! Got a ton of boring meetings on the docket today? A former Google and Stripe executive has some tips for keeping people engaged. (Hint: Do some prep work.) In today's big story, it was the biggest day of the year for Apple. We break down all the major product announcements and make the case for why the iPhone Air is actually pretty cool. What's on deck: Markets: The stock market is turning into a ticking time bomb, and the growing mountain of rough economic data is the trigger. Tech: It's back to the office for Microsoft workers. And the AI team isn't getting a pass. Business: A first-hand account of buying an apartment in NYC as a Gen Zer. (Yes, it's possible!) But first, Air Apple. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's an iPhone, just make it thinner. The star of Apple's big, annual product reveal was the iPhone Air, a slimmed-down version of the popular smartphone. At a whopping 5.6 millimeters — that's less than a quarter-inch for metric system haters — Apple said the iPhone Air is thin enough to fit on a fingertip. The iPhone Air's smaller size comes with a few sacrifices. Its camera, internal chip, and battery are all a bit of a step down from its bigger siblings. And at $999, it's more than a base model iPhone, making it no bargain. However, Apple says it's making the most of its size, calling it "the most power-efficient iPhone we've ever made" and touting its durability. It might not be the groundbreaking announcement you were hoping for, but iPhone launches rarely are these days. A slightly improved camera here. A moderately better chip there. That's part of the reason why iPhone users hold onto their phones for a lot longer than Apple would like. Apple's big AI push last year was meant to encourage users to finally upgrade their phones, but Apple Intelligence mostly fell flat. So, if you can't attract them with the software, pitch them on the hardware! And the iPhone Air, if nothing else, is pretty impressive to look at. It also appears to have at least one convert. BI's Katie Notopoulos is very excited about the iPhone Air. She explained why the slimmed-down iPhone is exactly what she's been looking for. Still, arguably the toughest and most important critic wasn't impressed. Apple's stock finished the day down almost 1.5%. It wasn't just about the iPhone Air. BI's Sarah Jackson broke down all the big product announcements from Apple. Here are some of the highlights: The other iPhones: The iPhone 17 Pro's camera is comparable to eight professional lenses. It'll cost you at least $1,099, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro's starting price, but it has more storage (256 GB instead of 128 GB). If you're really trying to ball out, the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Meanwhile, the entry-level iPhone 17 price of $799 is the same as last year. AirPods Pro 3: The big news here is a heart rate sensor for the gym bros/gals. That could serve as a bridge into more health-related products from Apple. There's also a Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The new buds start at $249. Apple Watch: The biggest upgrades are battery life, a scratch-resistant screen, and a better display. The Ultra 3 ($799) can last up to 42 hours on a full charge, while the Series 11 ($399) and SE 3 ($249) will last 24 and 18 hours, respectively. 1. The labor market is a lot cooler than we thought — and not in a good way. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 911,000 fewer non-farm jobs were added from April 2024 to March 2025 than previously reported. Most major industry sectors, including leisure and hospitality, saw large downward revisions. 2. How long can stock investors keep ignoring bad economic data? The latest revision to the labor market (see above) wasn't good, and inflation is still a concern. Yet the stock market is already fully valued, and major indexes are sitting at record highs. Once investors flip their stance on the economic data, watch out, BI's Joe Ciolli writes. 3. Citi poaches a longtime IBM executive to pursue its AI ambitions. Shobhit Varshney, the firm's new head of AI, will report to Citi's chief operating officer and work closely with its chief technology officer, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. About 175,000 employees already have access to Citi's AI tools. 1. One of Big Tech's last RTO holdouts is calling workers back to the office. Microsoft employees will be required to go in three days a week, according to an internal email sent to staff and seen by BI. The mandate will happen in three phases, starting at the end of February 2026. And if you're one of Microsoft's AI stars, the RTO guidelines are even stricter. 2. One step closer to mind control? The Pentagon just partnered with Phantom Neuro, a startup that wants to let users control prosthetic limbs with muscle memory. The startup received roughly $300,000 from the DOD's emerging tech group and raised $19 million Series A in April. 3. Verily is restructuring in anticipation of new investors. In a recent town hall meeting, CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily is transforming to a C-corp business structure as it seeks a fresh round of investment. Employees were also told their stock was being revalued, dropping around 80% compared to their 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by BI. 1. It's giving homeowner. BI reporter and "geriatric Gen Zer" Juliana Kaplan recently bought an apartment in New York City at 28 years old. With a little bit of smart saving and luck, here's how she did it. 2. Whoop's CEO believes in work-life harmony, not work-life balance. The difference is flexibility, the fitness-tech CEO explained in the latest installment of BI's Power Hours. He shared his daily routine, from early morning workouts to cold plunges and meditation. 3. Four-day RTO vs. eight weeks of severance. That's the balance some NBCUniversal employees are weighing in the wake of a return-to-office order set to begin January 5. Unusually, the offer isn't based on employee tenure — everyone gets eight weeks regardless of how long they've been there. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2025/09/10/oracle-stock-up-94-on-growth-forecast-learn-whether-to-buy-orcl/

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock surged significantly, driven by an extremely bullish long-term forecast for its cloud infrastructure, particularly in AI, despite missing recent quarterly earnings.The company projects massive cloud revenue growth, from $18 billion in FY2026 to $144 billion by FY2030, securing major AI contracts and leveraging its database advantage for AI inference.However, risks include substantial capital expenditure, fierce competition, and the potential for reduced AI investment if businesses don't see sufficient economic returns or during an economic downturn. Oracle shares have soared 94% since the beginning of 2025 – with a more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading today. That huge gain took place after the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 49 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether Oracle can begin to beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle expects rapid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Oracle CEO Safra Katz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote in an August Forbes post, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app – akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study – based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments – from MIT’s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, he added the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93 – meaning Oracle is more than 21% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise at least until the company’s next earnings report.

Title: Apple’s ultrathin iPhone impresses fans but not investors

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Hello. It’s Jeremy here. First up, I want to wish Andrew, who normally writes this newsletter, a big congratulations on the birth of his new baby boy, who made his world debut yesterday! Andrew had to leave Fortune Brainstorm Tech early to greet his new arrival, but let’s catch him and you up on a few things he missed. Here were some highlights from yesterday: And don’t forget that you can watch the livestream of the conference’s final day here.Apple’s big “awe-dropping” hardware show yesterday ended up being more like a “meh dropping” (doesn’t quite have the same ring to it), at least as far as the company’s investors were concerned. The stock drifted lower in after-hours trading.While the new iPhone Air is impressively svelte and got phone aficionados talking, many of the other announcements—updated Apple watches, new AirPods—were more niche and unlikely to alter perceptions that the company has lost some of its former mojo. Fortune’s Dave Smith has a breakdown of the announcements below.Today, the tech world is eagerly awaiting another sort of debut—fintech Klarna’s IPO on the NYSE. The Swedish buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40, valuing the company at about $15 billion. That will earn a nice 6x return for venture capital firm Sequoia, which invested about $500 million in Klarna starting back in 2010, according to a story in The Information. But it’s a lot less than the $46 billion valuation the company achieved in a Softbank-led round in 2021 (a round that Sequoia pointedly did not participate in.) We’ll see how much the stock pops today on opening. Beatrice Nolan has more on Klarna in the news section below.Before we go, be sure to check out Leo Schwarz’s great profile piece on Ramp, the fast-growing fintech that is automating how corporate finance departments work.And also worth a read is Sharon Goldman’s feature on Cohere, the Canadian AI company that many considered an also-ran in the AI race but which is making a bid for renewed relevancy with a big hire from Meta, a new CFO, and a $7 billion valuation.Onwards…—Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Highlights include the AirPods Pro 3 with improved ANC, live translation, and built-in heart-rate tracking. Three new Watches, the Series 11 with blood pressure monitoring and better durability, the SE 3 with an always-on display and faster charging, and the rugged Ultra 3 with satellite connectivity and a record 42-hour battery. On the phone side, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display, upgraded cameras, and the new iPhone Air as a fresh model in the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max bring lighter builds, ceramic shield backs, major camera upgrades, and the longest iPhone battery life ever. Here’s the full rundown of everything the tech giant announced at its annual event. The launches come as Apple leans on hardware innovation to buy time for its delayed AI strategy, with Wall Street watching closely to see if these devices can spark stronger upgrade cycles. — Dave Smith Klarna's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) is finally here. The buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40 per share, valuing the company at about $15 billion, significantly lower than the $45 billion valuation it achieved in 2021. Despite the lower valuation, major investor Sequoia is set to gain nearly $3 billion from its $500 million investment in the company over the last 15 years, per The Information. The fintech, which was once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company, has been planning the listing for years but economic and political headwinds, including sweeping U.S. tariffs have delayed its market debut several times. Investors are hopeful the company could set a trend for high-growth fintech listings after a period of slowdown in both tech IPOs and M&A activity. Losses in the first half of the fiscal year and an internal AI pullback could cast a shadow over Klarna’s IPO. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can pull off a strong market debut. — Beatrice Nolan As Congress considers new rules that restrict the sale of AI chips to China, Nvidia has a new strategy to protect the billion-dollar market. The Senate and the House are weighing rules that would require U.S. companies to prioritize domestic access to the technology before it can be sold abroad. To tackle this and protect the potentially $50 billion market, the chipmaker has painted the limits as left-wing paranoia pushed by a group of AI doomers, according to a report from The New York Times. Nvidia’s aggressive push has rattled Republicans backing the restrictions and pulled Washington into what is primarily a Silicon Valley-based clash between “accelerationists,” who want to supercharge AI growth, and “doomers,” who raise concerns about the technology’s risks. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, has reiterated Nvidia’s attacks, labeling the regulation advocates a “doomer cult.” On his All-In podcast, Sacks even suggested they should be “Loomered,” suggesting far-right activist Laura Loomer should campaign to get them dismissed. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment, which could reshape the U.S.–China tech relations, as early as Tuesday. — Beatrice Nolan OpenAI’s largest investor is working with rival AI lab, Anthropic. Microsoft is set to use Anthropic’s tech for AI features in Office 365 after executives found Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 in some tasks, according to a report from The Information. Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot add-on already has over 100 million users, and analysts estimate it could be a $1 billion annual business. Microsoft will access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services, and the move will blend Anthropic and OpenAI’s technology in the apps. It’s the latest sign that Microsoft is taking steps to lessen its reliance on its closer partner in the AI space. This isn’t Microsoft’s first pivot away from OpenAI: earlier this year, the company announced that its GitHub Copilot codewriting tools would use Anthropic’s models to power advanced “agent” features, rather than relying solely on OpenAI. The move comes amid months of negotiations between OpenAI and the tech giant over the ChatGPT maker’s plan to restructure its for-profit division in preparation for a potential public offering. — Beatrice Nolan PwC U.K. cuts entry-level hiring amid AI uncertainty. The firm's U.K. chief admitted that graduate hiring is “under pressure.” U.S. tech companies accused of enabling China’s digital police state. An AP investigation found that Amazon, IBM, and Dell helped build China’s surveillance state. Robinhood says its latest product will fix social media trading. The trading giant has a new app feature called “Robinhood Social” where users can follow prominent traders. Oracle soars on ambitious cloud growth forecasts. Oracle’s shares surged after projecting $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. Meta’s new AI team is stirring up new tensions with old staff.

Title: A Record 500 American Billionaires Are Too Poor To Make The Forbes 400

ByMartina Di Licosa, Contributor. Few things could make the average billionaire feel poor—The Forbes 400 list is one of them. There are now a record 900 billionaires in the U.S., meaning a record 500 people have amassed a ten-figure fortune but are still simply not rich enough to make the top 400 in 2025. It’s a tough list to crack, and getting tougher. Back in 1982, there were fewer than two dozen billionaires on the original Forbes 400, which required a minimum net worth of just $100 million to make the cut. Four decades later, it now takes $3.8 billion to make the ranking, up $500 million from just a year ago. More than 90% of last year’s list held onto their spot this year. Still, 19 billionaires worth $3.7 billion came up just short of stealing a place on the ranking. That includes design software firm Figma’s cofounder Dylan Field and athleisure brand Alo Yoga’s cofounders Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, as well as Dario Amodei and five other cofounders of AI juggernaut Anthropic (a seventh cofounder of the company, Christopher Olah, is also worth $3.7 billion but is Canadian). Another 11 billionaires missed the cut by just $200 million, with a $3.6 billion fortune. Those rich enough to make Forbes’ billionaires list but not rich enough to make The Forbes 400 also include some of the world’s most famous people. Embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon is $400 million too poor. Oprah Winfrey would need another $700 million to make the grade. Taylor Swift, who has added an additional $500 million to her fortune since Forbes first named her a billionaire in 2023 on the back of her global Eras Tour, is still $2.2 billion short. Several recent additions to the billionaires list missed this year’s Forbes 400 as well, including South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (net worth: $1.2 billion apiece) and Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who has fallen from the billionaire ranks amid the fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain’s slumping stock price. There’s always next year for these billionaires. Just ask Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, Dutch Bros coffee cofounder Travis Boersma, and the 12 other billionaires who made The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2025. The brains behind South Park got rich one offensive episode at a time. Now in its 27th season, the hit show has won four Emmys, and its creators ranked #1 on Forbes’ most recent list of the highest-paid TV showrunners. Parker and Stone became billionaires in July after they signed a $1.5 billion streaming deal to bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. The first active NBA player to become a billionaire, his athletic talent has earned him more than $500 million in pretax salary over the course of his two-decade career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and his current team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Then there’s his off-court earnings, upwards of $900 million pretax, from business ventures like production company SpringHill and endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Beats by Dre. Swift holds the record for the most albums to sell one million copies in a single week in the modern era, with seven of her albums, including 1989 (Taylor's Version) and The Tortured Poets Department, reaching that milestone in seven days. She toured her way into the billionaire ranks, joining the list in 2023 while traveling the globe on her Eras Tour, which generated more than $2 billion of revenue and ranks as the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her family made her famous, but most of Kardashian’s wealth comes from shapewear brand Skims, which she founded in 2019 and is expanding internationally with stores in London and Dubai. In 2022, she cofounded private equity firm SKKY Partners, which has invested in companies like UK-based luxury skincare brand 111SKIN and premium, truffle-based sauce and condiments purveyor TRUFF. Field cofounded web-based design company Figma in 2012 after dropping out of Brown University. In 2022, he agreed to sell his startup to Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was killed by regulators. Figma went public in July 2025, and its stock more than tripled on its first trading day. It’s lost nearly 40% of its value since, with the company reporting slower sales growth and worse-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2025, as well as third-quarter guidance that disappointed analysts and investors. Londsdale got his start working for billionaire investor Peter Thiel's hedge fund. He is now the managing partner of $6 billion (assets) venture capital firm 8VC. He cofounded data mining firm Palantir in 2003; it now has a market capitalization of $370 billion. Lonsdale was also an early investor in Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Scale AI’s cofounder and former CEO briefly became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, at age 25, after private investors valued his data labeling company at $7.3 billion. Then private markets plunged and knocked Wang from the billionaire ranks. He regained his title in 2024, when Scale raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation, and has held onto it ever since. In June, Wang’s fortune soared by $1.2 billion, to $3.2 billion, after Meta paid more than $14 billion for 49% of Scale, and Wang left Scale to become the social media giant’s new chief AI officer. As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick rebuilt the trading and investment management firm after 658 employees died in the 9/11 attacks. Now he’s serving in the Trump administration as Secretary of Commerce, focusing on tariffs, and has turned the company's management over to a trio of co-CEOs. Luckey got rich creating Oculus VR and, more recently, selling weapons. His defense startup Anduril boomed with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “We want to be the company that when the DoD needs something, we're the first people they think of,” he told Forbes at the time. Now he’s building crypto bank Erebor, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The Blackstone executive’s Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) owns stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, and the Premier League’s Crystal Palace. Blitzer also has stakes in the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and he co-owns MLS squad Real Salt Lake. Harris and Degeorge began selling clothing together right out of high school. Today, their athleisure brand Alo Yoga is bringing in an estimated $2 billion in revenue and has been seen on influencers like Kendall Jenner and Georgina Rodríguez. In August, Harris told Vogue Business that the brand will be launching a line of leather purses priced in the thousands in an effort to break into the luxury market. Formerly the vice president of research at OpenAI, Amodei is now the CEO of AI firm Anthropic, which built chatbot Claude. He cofounded the company in 2021 with six other former OpenAI employees, including his sister Daniela Amodei. Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation in early September.

Title: The Best And Worst Of Times: AI vs. SaaS for $1 Trillion Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/libertbarry/2025/09/09/the-best-and-worst-of-times-----ai-vs-saas-for-1-trillion-market/

ByBarry Libert, Contributor. Every day there are LinkedIn posts, as well as Forbes, NYT, and WSJ articles about the massive capital reallocation by customers and investors to AI from SaaS, foretelling the end of SaaS. Maybe this is right or maybe it is oversold. Who knows? Regardless, if you are a software customer, institutional investor, or even consumer, this tidal wave of migration – from SaaS to AI - is reshaping our world. The question is: What does this mean to you if you are a SaaS leader or investor? In short, this article will answer that question, as well as how to allocate your time and money to be a winner in this emerging market battle for time and money. In 2025, AI spending will approach $650B. You read that number correctly. And if that number doesn’t blow your mind – try this one. AI spending is growing at a mind-bending rate of more than 75% per year. Amazing - right? How about SaaS spending? Our tried-and-true business and investment darling over the past two decades is growing at a little over 18% per year (not too shabby). Stated differently, $300B will be invested this year in SaaS, which is half of the AI spend rate. Given these statistics, it’s clear that a war is emerging for a technological edge, as well as customer and investor dollars. Now that everyone knows what is at stake, the battle lines are being drawn. To understand this battle ground for dollars better, let’s start with the brutal facts that should keep SaaS investors and leaders up at night: What does this mean to you? From my perspective, there are a few emerging trends, about which I have written before, starting with the AI rallying cry - To Be or Not to Be All-In-AI is The Only Question. The AI winners understand this and are attacking traditional SaaS companies on three primary fronts: The brutal question: Is driving 30 MPH the same as driving 100 MPH (think of MPH as analogous to yearly growth rates - 30% CAGR versus 100%). The answer is - definitely not. And for many reasons: different growth rates are dependent on different boards, leaders, products, technologies, cultures, and GTM motions. All of these factors taken together create a dilemma for even the best SaaS leaders and investors. Witness Salesforce’s recent share price performance -- their stock is off nearly 30% – due to a lack of AI preparedness, products, and skills. Given this reality, here are three factors that you need to seriously consider at your next team off-site and board meeting. In short, ask yourself, do you have the right: Workday, Atlassian, Box, HubSpot and Monday, to name just a few SaaS leaders, are now responding - embedding AI everywhere in everything they do. Though they have NOT YET seen a real boost in revenues from their AI spending, they are making hard decisions. To ensure your success, follow these 7 steps: As the CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp says: “The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.” The market agrees: Palantir is one of today’s most valuable companies trading at atmospheric heights (>50X revenues). Whether or not you agree with their valuation is not the point. Just see their positioning, product offerings and growth rates and know that we are living a new reality. The Bottom Line: A war is being waged between AI and SaaS for investor and customer dollars. SaaS leaders and investors can still win, but they need to be All-in-AI. There is no time to wait. It’s a high-stakes battle for the future of software customer spending. That is the simple reality of it all. It is up to you as a SaaS leader and investor. Allocate your capital wisely or risk being left behind while also generating sub par financial returns for your people and investors.

Title: Morgan Stanley flags 3 cybersecurity stocks poised to rally as threats increase and IT spending jumps
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-now-top-cybersecurity-stock-picks-zs-crwd-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-09T16:40:53Z

Morgan Stanley says a few cybersecurity firms are primed for further upside as companies pump money into streamlined security platforms. The share prices of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler should all get a boost in the coming 12 months, the bank's software equity research team said in a note earlier this month. The three companies are best-positioned for a mega wave of "platformization" for cybersecurity products, with firms looking to integrate and simplify their cyber-defense structures. All three of the stocks offer solutions across multiple parts of the security chain, like devices, cloud, applications, and networks. "We expect platformization to continue as security needs grow against tight budgets, environments get more complex, a problem that only gets worse with AI," analyst Meta A. Marshall, the lead author of the note, wrote. Morgan Stanley expects the $270 billion cybersecurity market to grow by about 12% a year over the next few years. The bank also cited its CIO survey data showing that firms intend to spend 50% more on cybersecurity products than general software products in the years ahead as a reason to be bullish. On Morgan Stanley's list of 15 software stocks to watch, two key drivers of forward returns are revenue growth (for long-term returns) and free-cash flow margins (for short-term performance), the bank said. Among those on the list, the median projected revenue growth is 11.8% and the median projected free cash flow margin is 26.6%. Palo Alto Networks has projected revenue growth of 13.6% for next year and 38.3% projected free cash flow margins, part of the reason that Morgan Stanley has an "Overweight" rating on the stock. As of September 2, the stock has 9% implied upside to its price target, the bank said, and 36% upside in its bull case scenario. "In our view, Palo Alto Networks should be one of the few leading platform vendors in security longer-term, especially as the platformization strategy continues to gain momentum and more security vendors consolidate," the bank said of the firm. For shares of CrowdStrike, which MS gives an "Equal Weight" rating, the bank sees 9% upside as a base case and 30% upside in its bull case. Its projected revenue growth is 21.5% and its projected free cash flow margin is 31%. Finally, Zscaler, which the bank recently upgraded to an "Overweight" rating, should climb 16% to the bank's price target, it said. Its bull-case scenario is a 44% gain. Its revenue is projected to grow by 18.3% and its projected free cash flow margin is 27.3%. "We think ZS could cement itself as the next true platform (along with PANW and CRWD)," the bank said.

Title: Impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions in Inner Mongolia, China
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331914

Against the backdrop of grassland ecological degradation, grassland transfer has become a crucial pathway for optimizing livestock resource allocation and promoting sustainable pastoral development. Based on survey data from 383 herder households in the farming–pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China, this study applies Heckman models, mediation models, and moderation models to examine the impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that digital technology significantly increases both the probability and the scale of grassland leasing-in among herders. Moreover, digital technology indirectly promotes grassland leasing-in by enhancing scale efficiency. Notably, strong social networks weaken the facilitating role of digital technology in grassland transfer, whereas weak social networks strengthen it. The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is especially pronounced under environmental regulations with weak incentives but strong constraints. Finally, compared with ordinary herders, digital technology has a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in only for new-type operators. In addition, the impact of digital technology is more pronounced among groups with higher levels of education.

Grasslands are among the most widely distributed vegetation types worldwide [1], covering about 40% of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) and supporting the livelihoods of nearly one billion people [2]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. Grasslands also act as ecological barriers closely connected to socioeconomic development and regional ecological security [3,4]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. China boasts abundant grassland resources, with its prairie area accounting for approximately 12% of the global total, ranking first in the world [5]. According to data from the Third National Land Survey, grassland area is second only to forest land, making it the second largest land use type in China, covering about 27.56% of the national territory. Consequently, they constitute the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the country [6,7]. However, weak management systems and increasing human disturbances have created severe ecological challenges [8], including shrinking grassland area, declining quality, reduced grazing capacity, and further degradation such as desertification and salinization [9]. Statistics show that nearly 90% of China’s usable natural grasslands have degraded, expanding at a rate of two million hectares annually [10]. Facing these impacts, grassland remains the fundamental resource for herders’ livelihoods. Grassland transfer is a key mechanism for optimizing resource allocation in animal husbandry [11]. Since the reform era, the household contract responsibility system has led to resource misallocation across labor, grassland, livestock, and productive assets [12]. To address resource scarcity and improve production efficiency, the grassland transfer system emerged [13], currently referring mainly to the transfer of grassland management or usage rights [11]. Therefore, in this study, “grassland leasing-in” refers to the practice whereby a herder leases-in grassland from another right holder—via formal contractual arrangements or informal agreements—to acquire grassland management rights. Compared with farming households, herders face more severe resource imbalances, making grassland transfer a vital means to balance resources, break the cycle of degradation and poverty, and promote sustainable development in grassland-based animal husbandry [12]. Herders’ grassland transfer behaviors typically take three forms: non-participation, leasing-in, and leasing-out. In theory, herders engage in land transactions to improve welfare [14]. Leasing-in occurs when herders rent additional grassland to achieve scale economies and higher profits [15], while leasing-out often reflects unstable livestock income and the attraction of stable subsidies, rent, or off-farm employment [12,16]. Non-participation may result from constraints such as limited capital [17–20], ecological concerns [21,22], subsidy policies [23], high transaction costs [24], perceived risks [25], or incomplete markets [19]. A notable emerging constraint is the digital divide, which limits herders’ access to digital tools and platforms that could facilitate transactions. Digital technologies can address these barriers by reducing transaction costs, improving information flow, and enabling off-farm employment [26]. This aligns with broader research on agricultural land transfer, which highlights four mechanisms: reducing transaction costs through digital platforms, enhancing social capital via virtual networks, mitigating information asymmetry, and facilitating labor reallocation to non-agricultural sectors [27,28]. Together, these mechanisms are reshaping traditional patterns of pastoral resource allocation. Despite this progress, several research gaps remain. First, little attention has been paid to the relationship between digital technology and grassland leasing-in, as most studies focus on farmland transfer. Second, existing analyses emphasize information acquisition, while the efficiency-enhancing role of digital technology remains unexplored. Third, because grassland ecosystems are fragile, grassland transfer is strongly influenced by policy, suggesting that the effect of digital technology may vary across institutional contexts. Fourth, differences in resource endowments among production entities lead to divergent transfer behaviors, but few studies examine how digital technology affects these differences. To address these gaps, this study focuses on four key questions: What impact does digital technology have on grassland leasing-in? What role does scale efficiency play in this relationship? Does the effect depend on social networks? Does the impact of digital technology vary with external environments and herders’ characteristics? Exploring these questions is crucial for advancing digital rural construction and transforming animal husbandry development models. According to Schultz’s theory, the introduction of modern production factors is essential for transforming traditional agriculture [29]. As a new production factor, digital technology provides abundant data for pastoral production, streamlines information acquisition [30], enables rapid dissemination and integration of agricultural and pastoral information [31], and supports herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions by improving information availability. This reduces information asymmetry [32,33], lowers information costs, and thereby facilitates grassland transfer. More importantly, digital technology leverages data as a new production factor to exert its enabling function [34]. In animal husbandry, it represents an innovation in production methods, shifting the dominant mode of production from reliance on manual labor to intelligent machinery. Traditionally, livestock rearing requires extensive manual intervention, which constrains the scale of operations. Theoretically, enabling fewer people to manage larger herds could overcome the main bottleneck to higher output and profitability [35]. Digital technology addresses this constraint by replacing routine, repetitive, and some non-routine tasks, generating a substitution effect [36]. This shift from mechanization to intelligent systems reduces labor intensity and expands the management scope and capacity of each laborer. For example, real-time livestock tracking reduces the time spent locating animals, while remote herd monitoring minimizes unnecessary labor inputs. As a result, with equal or even reduced labor input, herders can manage larger herds, overcome scale bottlenecks, reduce management costs, and enhance scale efficiency. Improved scale efficiency further lowers unit production costs and substantially increases expected returns from expansion. Based on the rational-economic agent assumption, herders are therefore more likely to lease in grassland to expand production and pursue higher returns. However, adopting digital technology also involves risks—such as data tampering, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access—that may undermine operational integrity and reduce expected gains without sufficient safeguards. As Yazdinejad et al. [37] note, smart farming and precision agriculture systems face increasing security threats, requiring robust countermeasures such as encryption, intrusion detection, and secure communication protocols. Furthermore, while enhancing scale efficiency, digital technology also mitigates livestock disease and management risks, strengthening herders’ confidence in leasing-in and managing grassland. Ultimately, it improves managerial capacity and cost advantages, potentially increasing future demand for additional grassland to exploit scale economies. Based on this theoretical analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed: H1:‌ Digital technology positively facilitates herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. H2:‌ Digital technology indirectly promotes herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior by enhancing scale efficiency. Social relationships include both strong ties and weak ties. Strong ties usually exist between individuals with frequent interaction and close relationships, often yielding repetitive or redundant information. By contrast, weak ties connect individuals with diverse socio-economic characteristics, such as different experiences, knowledge, and backgrounds, and are generally superior in providing novel, effective, and non-redundant information [38]. A key function of social networks in grassland transfer is information acquisition. Herders obtain policy information and grassland-related details from their social networks. As a non-market pathway, social networks disseminate policy information and help herders understand other stakeholders’ perspectives. The larger the social network, the more diverse the information herders can access [39]. In information-scarce pastoral areas, choosing transaction partners based on personal relationships is the primary way to mitigate risks [40]. The main advantage of strong social networks is their emotional support, which constrains both parties, reduces contract breaches and land degradation, lowers moral hazard and transaction costs, and has historically supported grassland transfer processes [41]. However, with the development of digital technology, the role of strong social networks may be declining. Digital technology reduces information asymmetry, enabling impersonal transactions, and also provides formal contract safeguards, reducing dependence on relational contracts. Unlike strong ties, weak-tie networks connect groups with different education levels, incomes, and ages, giving them a comparative advantage in accessing non-redundant information. When informal reciprocity cannot meet herders’ demand for grassland resources and expansion, they must seek additional lease information, and the “information bridge” function of weak ties becomes critical [42]. However, transactions in weak-tie networks often require institutional safeguards [43]. Without digital tools, herders with sparse social ties lack institutional support, hindering independent transfers. Conversely, effective use of digital tools can fill these institutional gaps by providing information exchange and formal safeguards, even for sparsely connected herders or transactions between strangers, thereby promoting grassland leasing-in through weak-tie networks. Thus, different social networks may moderate the effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in in distinct ways. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose: H3:‌ Strong social networks weaken, whereas weak social networks strengthen, the positive effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. The adoption and diffusion of technology are widely recognized as being shaped by individuals’ educational attainment [44]. Theoretically, herders with higher education generally have stronger abilities in acquiring and processing information, which enables them to better use digital platforms—for example, for online leasing, price comparison, and contract signing. Empirical research supports this view: farmers with higher education show greater willingness to adopt smart agricultural technologies [45]. These cognitive advantages allow them to use digital tools more effectively in practice. By contrast, herders with lower education often face barriers to adopting and applying digital technologies. The higher cognitive costs of understanding tools, operating platforms, or evaluating risks may cause reluctance or mistrust, thereby reducing the utility of these technologies. Consequently, higher education is likely to enhance the positive impact of digital technology on grassland transfer decisions. At the same time, leasing behaviors are also shaped by other individual characteristics and external policy environments [46–49]. In recent years, China’s livestock production system has shifted from traditional household contracting to new-type operators—such as large-scale households, family ranches, cooperatives, and livestock enterprises—which has accelerated grassland transfer [50]. This is mainly because, first, unlike ordinary herders, new-type operators earn most of their income from livestock production, prioritize long-term development, and typically require large-scale land transfers to meet specialized production needs [51,52]. By contrast, ordinary herders increasingly diversify their livelihoods and engage in pluriactivity [53,54]. According to comparative advantage theory, they reduce labor input in livestock production, focus less on long-term benefits, and prefer to increase non-pastoral income, thereby reducing their likelihood of leasing-in grassland [55,56]. Second, as market-oriented organizations [57], new-type operators have stronger risk-bearing capacity than ordinary herders, who are constrained by subsistence and risk aversion, thereby increasing the probability of leasing-in. Third, higher intensification among new-type operators their adoption of digital technologies, further increasing the probability of leasing-in [58]. Fourth, contiguous operations among new-type operators optimize production efficiency, further increasing incentives for leasing-in. Moreover, intensified economic activities place substantial pressure on grassland ecosystems [59]. In response, China implemented the Grassland Ecological Compensation Awards (GECA) policy to protect grassland ecology. As the world’s largest ecological compensation program in coverage and beneficiaries, GECA reshapes herders’ expected returns from grasslands and alters their land management strategies [60]. Under grassland degradation, GECA focuses on livestock reduction and grazing bans through incentive and restrictive instruments: restrictive policies impose economic or reputational penalties on non-compliant herders to increase violation costs, while incentive policies provide subsidies to offset losses and externalities from destocking, thereby stabilizing economic expectations. As a result, herders’ leasing-in behavior shows heterogeneity under different environmental regulations. Specifically, when subsidies fail to cover the opportunity costs of destocking, herders cannot rely on compensation alone, making leasing-in a rational choice for profit. At the same time, strict penalties for overstocking raise the marginal costs of non-compliance, compelling herders to acquire grassland legally to avoid penalties. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis H4:‌ The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is heterogeneous. This study develops a conceptual framework examining digital technology’s impact on grassland transfer (Fig 1). Source: Prepared by the authors based on the study’s conceptual design.

The study sites lie in the agro-pastoral ecotone of the southern Greater Khingan Mountains and include Keshiketeng, Bairin Right, Bairin Left, Ongniud, and Ar Horqin Banners. Minors were excluded from the survey population. Before data collection, all participants were informed of the research purpose and provided written consent, confirming voluntary participation. The project was approved by the School Research Ethics Panel of the corresponding institution (approval code: NNDKY2024004). A stratified random sampling design was adopted at the sumu (township) level, covering 31 sampled sumu. Within each stratum, interviewers randomly selected household identifiers from updated administrative rosters of registered herder households provided by local authorities. One adult decision-maker from each household was interviewed face-to-face. The target sample was proportionally allocated across strata according to the number of registered herder households, ensuring representativeness across banners and sumu. After fieldwork, records were screened using a pre-specified protocol. Following rigorous quality checks, 29 questionnaires were excluded due to critical errors, substantial missing values, or extreme outliers that could not be corrected. These excluded cases were distributed across different townships and did not cluster in any specific category of herders, minimizing the risk of systematic bias. The remaining 383 valid questionnaires produced an effective response rate of 93%. Two primary sources of potential bias are recognized. First, non-response and temporary unavailability during peak husbandry activities may bias the sample toward time-constrained households. This was mitigated by scheduling visits outside peak hours when possible and conducting in-person callbacks. In the empirical analysis, household and operational controls as well as township fixed effects were also included. Second, differences in comprehension, especially among older or less educated respondents, may cause measurement errors. To minimize such errors, trained interviewers explained questionnaire items in detail. Econometric analyses using Heckman and IV-Heckman specifications, along with robustness checks, confirmed that the main results remained robust. This region was selected for two reasons. First, the third national land survey shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 81.56 million hectares of grassland, accounting for 20.56% of China’s total and 46% of the region’s landmass. Of this, natural pasture covers 71.88 million hectares, artificial pasture 1.91 million hectares, and other types 9.49 million hectares. The grassland ecosystem is highly diverse, with eight major categories, 21 subcategories, and 476 types, forming a rich repository of natural resources. Surveying this area thus provides comprehensive and representative herder samples. Second, as a key agro-pastoral transition zone, it is one of China’s most ecologically vulnerable and poverty-concentrated areas [61,62], making it particularly relevant for studying grassland transfer. The distribution of the survey area is shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.g002 Grassland leasing-in is a two-stage decision process: first, deciding whether to lease-in grassland, and second, determining the transfer area. Sample selection bias may arise because some herders who wish to lease-in may abstain due to individual constraints. Consequently, only samples that exhibit leasing-in behavior provide observable area data. To address this issue, the Heckman model is employed. Stage 1: Transfer Participation Decision A probit regression models herders’ binary transfer decision using fitted values and residuals of digital technology variables alongside exogenous covariates: where denotes the grassland leasing-in decision (1 = yes; 0 = no), represents digital technology variables, is a vector of control variables, denotes the intercept, and are parameter estimates, and is the stochastic error term. Stage 2: Transfer Area Determination An OLS regression estimates the transfer area using fitted values and residuals of digital technology-related variables with exogenous predictors: where indicates the grassland leasing-in area, and are as previously defined, is the intercept, and are parameters, denotes the error term. In the Heckman model, technology promotion is used as the identifying variable. It affects herders’ decisions to lease-in grassland but does not directly influence the scale of leasing. The rationale is that agricultural technology extension is a key policy instrument for knowledge dissemination [63]. When organized by local governments, such campaigns change herders’ perceptions [64], and improved cognition is expected to generate more rational behavioral responses [65]. Existing studies also show that cognitive levels significantly influence farmers’ willingness to engage in land transfer [66]. However, without sufficient capital and labor, exposure to technology promotion alone cannot increase the feasible scale of leased grassland. Thus, technical publicity satisfies the relevance conditions for influencing participation in leasing without directly affecting the leased-in area. Nevertheless, the above estimations may still suffer from endogeneity issues arising from omitted variables, measurement errors, or reverse causality. To address this concern, the present study employs the IV-Heckman model to overcome potential sample endogeneity. Following prior research [67], we use the “digital technology adoption rate within the same sumu (township)” as an instrumental variable for individual adoption. The rationale is twofold: first, the township-level adoption rate is highly correlated with individual adoption, as herders within the same township face similar livestock production environments and share common infrastructure. Second, conditional on control variables, township-level averages do not directly determine an individual household’s leasing scale or decision, which depend on household-specific resources and preferences. Hence, this variable satisfies both the relevance and exogeneity requirements for a valid instrument. Theoretical analysis suggests that digital technology may indirectly affect grassland leasing-in decisions through the mediating channel of scale efficiency. To test this mechanism empirically, we apply the causal mediation framework developed by Baron and Kenny [68] and extended by Wen [69]. Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, we use the nonparametric bootstrap procedure for mediation testing proposed by Preacher [70], which accommodates dichotomous outcomes without distributional assumptions. where denote the mediator variable (scale efficiency), denotes the grassland leasing-in decision, represents digital technology variables, and is a vector of control variable. To empirically assess the moderating role of social networks, the baseline model is augmented with interaction terms between digital technology and strong or weak social networks. The formal specification is as follows: Here, denote strong and weak social networks of herder household. Following previous studies [27], grassland transfer decisions are measured using two indicators: (i) a binary variable for leasing-in participation, and (ii) a continuous variable for the acquired grassland area. Digital technology is the primary explanatory variable. Despite improvements in network infrastructure in agro-pastoral regions, a secondary digital divide has emerged. This divide reflects competence gaps in using digital devices, retrieving information, and engaging in online marketing, and has become a major constraint limiting herders’ access to digital benefits [71]. To quantify digital technology use in livestock production, we employ a binary indicator based on herders’ self-reported adoption of digital technologies (e.g., video monitoring, traceability systems, positioning devices, drones, or smart feeding systems). Households that adopt at least one technology are coded as 1, and non-adopters as 0. Scale efficiency is the mediating variable. It is derived from Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) using DEAP 2.1 software, based on an input-oriented model with variable returns to scale (VRS). Inputs include pastureland (operated grassland area), labor (hired and family labor valued in monetary terms), and capital expenditures (forage, breeding services, fuel, fixed-asset depreciation, and other inputs), consistent with previous studies [72]. The output variable is the total pastoral production value. The moderating variables are strong and weak social networks. Strong ties mainly derive from kinship, close friends, and familiar neighbors, and their maintenance requires substantial gift-giving and ritual obligations [39]. Accordingly, “interpersonal expenditure” is used as the proxy for strong social network [73]. Weak ties lack strong emotional bonds, and “communication expenditure” effectively captures households’ access to broader information [74]. Consistent with prior studies, communication expenditure serves as the proxy for weak social network [75]. The model controls for pastoral household characteristics, operational attributes, and geographic heterogeneity. Individual characteristics encompass household head’s age, health status, education, and political status; household traits include dependency ratio, non-pastoral employment, per capita livestock income, and livestock income share; operational features control for per capita grassland area, per capita livestock scale, barn-feeding duration, and unit production cost. In addition, township-level dummy variables are included to capture regional fixed effects. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the key variables. Overall, about 16% of pastoral households participated in grassland transfer, with an average transferred area of 218 mu. In addition, 39% of households adopted digital technologies in production. For individual characteristics, household heads had an average age of 49 years, generally reported good health, and attained an education level equivalent to junior high school, with only a small proportion serving as village cadres. For household characteristics, families showed relatively low dependency ratios and a clear trend toward non-pastoral livelihoods. Per capita livestock income averaged 55,200 yuan, with livestock husbandry remaining the primary income source. From an operational perspective, households managed an average per capita grassland area of 310 mu and held 96 sheep-equivalent units per capita. Barn-feeding was the predominant rearing method and was associated with higher unit production costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t001 Table 2 reports the baseline results on the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. In Columns (1) and (2), the coefficients of digital technology are positive and statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. The average marginal effect in Column (1) is 0.0619, implying that households using digital technology are 6% more likely to participate in grassland leasing-in than non-users. Column (2) further shows that adopters lease in about 509 more mu of grassland. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t002 Columns (3) and (4) address endogeneity from reverse causality and sample selection. Results indicate that the coefficients of digital technologies remain positive and significant. The Wald test is significant at the 1% level, and the first-stage F-statistic is 31.97, confirming instrument validity. This confirms that digital technology promotes grassland leasing-in even after controlling for endogeneity. Hence, Hypothesis 1 is validated: digital technologies significantly increases both the likelihood of grassland leasing-in and the transferred area. Among personal characteristics, age negatively affects the transferred area. Older households tend to prioritize livelihood stability, and acquiring larger areas involves greater uncertainties and risks. Reduced labor capacity with age also leads households to retain contracted grasslands for subsistence instead of expanding through transfers. Political status exerts a positive effect, since village cadre household heads have greater access and capacity to acquire grassland. Regarding household characteristics, a higher livestock income share reduces the transferred area. One possible explanation is that more specialized pastoral households typically practice stall-feeding for longer durations, thereby reducing their demand for transferred grassland area. For operational characteristics, per capita grassland area positively affects transfer-in, whereas confinement feeding duration and unit production costs exert negative effects. Longer confinement reduces grazing demand, while higher costs economically constrain households and limit expansion. To further address potential sample selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was employed. As reported in Table 3, the PSM results show that households adopting digital technologies lease in about 123 more units of grassland. These findings confirm the robustness of the baseline estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t003 To further validate the reliability of the PSM estimates, a balance test was conducted, and the outcomes are reported in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, most standardized biases were substantially reduced after matching, with all falling below the 20% threshold [76]. Furthermore, post-matching t-tests for all covariates were insignificant, confirming that the assumptions of common support and balance were satisfied. These results further confirm the robustness of the estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t004 Following prior methodology [77], this study uses grassland rent as an alternative measure of grassland leasing-in and applies a Tobit regression model for robustness testing. The results reported in Table 5 indicate that the coefficients of digital technology remain significantly positive under this specification, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the baseline findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t005 A broader range of digital technology tools adopted by herders indicates a higher level of digital technology adoption. Accordingly, this study replaces the primary explanatory variable with the number of digital technology tool types as an alternative measure and re-estimates the baseline model. The results in Table 6 show that, under this specification, the diversity of digital technology tools has a significantly positive effect on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the previous results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t006 Since a lower proportion of livestock income in total household income indicates reduced reliance on pastoral activities—which may lead to more discretionary grassland leasing decisions [27]—this study conducts a robustness test by excluding households with livestock income shares below 20%. The models and control variables remain unchanged for re-estimation. The results show that, even after sample exclusion, digital technology continues to exert significantly positive effects on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby confirming the robustness of the regression outcomes (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t007 Table 8 presents the results of the mediation analysis for scale efficiency. The estimates indicate that digital technologies significantly improve scale efficiency at the 1% level, with adoption increasing scale efficiency by approximately 0.07 units relative to non-adopters. Scale efficiency also exerts a significantly positive impact on grassland leasing-in decisions at the 1% level, suggesting that improvements in efficiency substantially increase the likelihood of leasing-in. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t008 The mediation test shows that the confidence interval of the indirect effect excludes zero, whereas that of the direct effect includes zero, confirming a statistically significant indirect effect but an insignificant direct effect. These results confirm that digital technologies influence herders’ leasing-in decisions indirectly through scale efficiency, with the mediation effect accounting for 26.21% of the total effect. The proposed pathway “Digital Technology → Scale Efficiency → Grassland Leasing-In” is empirically supported. Mechanistically, digital tools substitute for traditional herding methods, thereby reducing management costs and enhancing scale efficiency. Higher scale efficiency allows herders to achieve greater output per unit of input, which in turn incentivizes grassland leasing-in. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical evidence supporting Hypothesis 2. Prior to empirical estimation, the variables of strong and weak social networks were mean-centered to mitigate multicollinearity [78]. Table 9 reports the estimation results for the moderating effects of social networks. The results show that strong social networks have a significantly positive coefficient at the 5% level, whereas their interaction with digital technologies is significantly negative at the same level. This implies that although traditional strong ties enhance the probability of leasing-in, their facilitating role diminishes once herders adopt digital technologies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t009 By contrast, weak social networks display insignificant direct effects, yet their interaction with digital technologies is significantly positive at the 5% level. This suggests that although weak ties alone do not foster leasing-in decisions, digital technologies unlock their latent value for adopters. The mechanism operates through two complementary channels: digital technologies enhance herders’ management capacity, while weak social networks supply critical information on leasing opportunities. This technological–informational complementarity generates synergistic effects that substantially facilitate leasing-in decisions. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical support for Hypothesis 3. We further examine whether the impact of digital technologies on grassland leasing-in differs across varying intensities of environmental regulation. To address sample size constraints, households were split into two subsamples—above-mean and below-mean groups—so as to ensure statistical robustness. Following the implementation outcomes of the grassland ecological subsidy and reward policy, herders with grazing ban enforcement intensity above the mean were classified as the “strong-restriction” group, whereas those below the mean comprised the “weak-restriction” group. Likewise, herders with grazing ban incentives above the mean were labeled as the “strong-incentive” group, while those below the mean were categorized as the “weak-incentive” group. To estimate the probability of leasing-in participation, a Probit regression model was employed, given its suitability for binary dependent variables. As shown in Table 10, digital technologies exert a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in within the weak-incentive group. Specifically, column (2) shows that a one-unit increase in digital technology adoption raises the probability of leasing-in participation by 9.50%. In contrast, the effect is statistically insignificant for the strong-incentive group. Likewise, in the strong-restriction group, digital technology adoption exerts a significantly positive effect: column (8) indicates that each additional unit of adoption increases the probability of leasing-in by 9.52%. By contrast, the effect remains insignificant for the weak-restriction group. Taken together, these findings underscore that the effect of digital technologies on leasing-in is conditional on the regulatory context. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t010 This heterogeneity can be interpreted as follows. Under weak incentives—where subsidies fail to offset economic losses from grazing bans—digital technologies allow herders to expand production by leasing additional grasslands, thereby compensating for subsidy shortfalls. Under strong restrictions, where grassland scarcity is exacerbated, digital technologies assist herders in acquiring legal grazing rights through leasing, thereby enabling compliance while optimizing resource allocation. We further distinguish between two categories of production entities: new-type operators and ordinary herders. Respondents were classified as new-type operators if they were professional large-scale households, family ranch managers, or members of specialized herders’ cooperatives, while all others were categorized as ordinary herders. Since this study focuses on individual households and data on leading enterprises and agricultural service organizations are scarce, the definition of new-type operators is confined to the three groups mentioned above. Based on the Probit model, results reported in Table 11 indicate that the coefficient of digital technology adoption for new-type operators is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. The marginal effect estimates further suggest that a one-unit increase in digital adoption raises the probability of grassland leasing-in by 11%. By contrast, the effect for ordinary herders remains statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impact of digital technology adoption across different types of production entities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t011 Since herders with different educational backgrounds vary in their ability to absorb new knowledge, technologies, and ideas, their production decisions may also differ accordingly. Based on the sample characteristics, households with more than nine years of education (above junior high school) were classified as the high-education group, while those with nine years or less (junior high school and below) were defined as the low-education group. The regression results are presented in Table 12. For the high-education group, digital technology adoption exerts a significant positive effect on grassland leasing-in. The marginal effect estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in adoption raises the probability of leasing-in by 11.76%. By contrast, the effect for the low-education group is statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the benefits of digital technology adoption are greater among more educated herders and provide empirical support for Hypothesis 4 (Table 12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t012 This study provides a systematic examination of the multiple pathways through which digital technologies influence herders’ decisions to lease in grassland. The empirical analysis demonstrates that such technologies not only exert a direct positive effect on the likelihood and scale of grassland leasing but also generate indirect benefits through the mediating role of scale efficiency. By enabling herders to overcome constraints on operational expansion and to optimize the allocation of production factors, digital adoption helps break through traditional bottlenecks. The analytical framework also incorporates multidimensional contextual factors—such as social networks, environmental regulations, the type of production entity and educational level—to reveal the multifaceted nature of digital transformation in pastoral regions. Further evidence suggests that the interaction between digital technologies and social networks is not uniform. In settings characterized by strong social networks, the traditional advantages of these networks tend to weaken in the digital era; conversely, in weaker networks, digital tools can unlock considerable latent value. This finding expands the research perspective on the interplay between social capital and technology adoption, implying that digitalization may reshape the structure of social capital in pastoral communities. The heterogeneous effects associated with environmental regulation further reveal that the influence of digital technologies is more pronounced in contexts where incentives are limited yet regulatory constraints are strong, highlighting the critical role of institutional environments in shaping technological impacts. Moreover, the benefits of digital adoption are found to be concentrated primarily among new types of production entities. This indicates that the digital divide in pastoral areas is rooted less in access to technology per se than in disparities in organizational capacity and specialization—an imbalance that, to some extent, runs counter to the inclusive development goals of current policy. The contributions of this study are twofold. Theoretically, it develops and empirically validates a “digital technology–scale efficiency–grassland leasing” pathway model, elucidating the moderating roles of social networks and institutional environments, and thereby enriching the research framework linking digital technologies with land transfer processes. Practically, the findings offer targeted guidance for formulating differentiated policies for digital pastoralism: on one hand, technology promotion strategies should be tailored to match varying social network structures and institutional conditions; on the other, policy should focus on narrowing the organizational gap that drives the digital divide, ensuring equitable benefits across diverse production entities through targeted training programs and institutional safeguards. International experiences provide additional context for interpreting these results. Studies on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau indicate that digital technologies have been highly effective in grassland monitoring [79], yet their broader development remains dependent on policy frameworks and public investment due to uneven infrastructure provision [80]. In New Zealand, such technologies have created new opportunities to enhance both the sustainability and productivity of grasslands and pastures [81]. In African pastoral areas, the introduction of mobile communication and other digital tools has markedly improved herders’ access to information on forage availability, water resources, and weather conditions [82]—an advantage particularly significant in weakly connected social networks, where it can expand the range of potential transactions. Similarly, research on the European ruminant industry has shown that the adoption of digital technologies is strongly correlated with herd size; compared with small-scale herders, those managing larger herds are more inclined to integrate advanced technologies into their operations [83]. Collectively, these cases reinforce the central conclusion of this study: while digital technologies hold substantial promise for improving grassland resource management, their effectiveness is shaped by social networks, policy support, and the type of production entity. Limitations remain. The cross-sectional dataset cannot capture dynamic impacts, and leasing-out behavior—often closely linked to leasing-in—is not examined. Future research should use panel data and an integrated framework covering both leasing-in and leasing-out to generate more comprehensive policy insights. Using micro-level survey data, this study empirically investigates the impact of digital technologies on herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. The analysis produces four key insights. First, adopting digital technologies optimizes the allocation of grassland resources and significantly increases both the probability of herders participating in transfer-in and the scale of transferred areas. Second, digital technologies indirectly enhance the probability of transfer-in by improving scale efficiency, highlighting their role in factor allocation. Third, strong social networks tend to weaken, whereas weak social networks moderately amplify, the positive influence of digital technologies on transfer-in. This pattern identifies social capital structure as a critical determinant of digital dividends. Fourth, the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in varies with the intensity of environmental regulation and the type of production entity. Specifically, digital adoption has a significant effect on leasing-in under weak-incentive and strong-restriction environments. Moreover, compared with ordinary herders, its positive effect is stronger for those with higher educational attainment and for new-type operators. Taken together, these findings suggest that digital technologies function not as universal enablers but as context-dependent catalysts, with their benefits concentrated where institutional conditions and organizational capacity are most aligned. Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following policy recommendations: First, promoting inclusive digital technology initiatives is essential. Beyond general advocacy, local governments and industry associations should provide last-mile connectivity subsidies to households in remote pastoral areas, ensuring stable internet access across villages and seasonal camps. This effort can be complemented by distributing “starter digital kits”—such as GPS ear tags, collars, and grass-yield sensors—to low-income herders. At the community level, shared digital service centers with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators should function as hubs for troubleshooting and equipment maintenance. For herders with lower levels of education, governments and local livestock departments should provide regular “one-to-one” or “peer-to-peer” digital literacy training. These programs should emphasize practical skills—such as mobile application use, operation of grassland leasing platforms, online price comparison, and digital contract signing—to help herders overcome barriers to digital adoption. Second, weak social networks can be leveraged as informational bridges by developing officially endorsed digital platforms for grassland transfer. These platforms should include standardized listing templates, searchable land-availability maps, and secure e-contract modules. To boost weak social networks, these platforms should incorporate open bidding functions and transparent transaction records accessible to all registered users. Trust among unfamiliar users can be strengthened through third-party credit scoring based on transaction history and performance insurance mechanisms that automatically compensate counterparties in case of breach. Third, the targeted cultivation of digitally enabled new-type operators—such as cooperatives and family ranches—should be prioritized. This requires tailored digital solutions (e.g., automated feed dispensers) together with capacity-building grants linked to measurable adoption outcomes. Subsidized technical advisory visits can support new-type operators in optimizing their operations, while peer-learning networks should diffuse best practices to smaller, traditional herders, thereby lowering technological barriers through spillover effects. Finally, strengthening the synergy between environmental regulations and digital technologies is essential. In practice, satellite-based grassland monitoring should be combined with real-time alerts to notify herders of grazing limits or degradation risks, enabling compliance before penalties occur. Local authorities should implement compliance-linked incentives, such as reduced land rental fees or direct payments for maintaining stocking rates within carrying capacity thresholds. To ensure fairness, these incentives should be delivered through the same digital platforms used for land transactions, with clear eligibility criteria and transparent, auditable disbursement processes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.s001 (XLSX)

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple on Tuesday rolled out its next generation of iPhones that includes a new ultra-thin model and a slight price hike for one of its high-end models, while the company feels the squeeze of a global trade war. The iPhone 17 line-up includes a new slimmed-down model that will adopt the “Air” name that Apple already uses for its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. In what has become an annual rite for Apple, all four new iPhone 17 models will feature better cameras and longer-lasting batteries than last year’s line-up. The iPhone 17 will all boast at least 256 gigabytes of storage, doubling the minimum amount from the last generation. “We are raising the bar again,” Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted in front of a crowd gathered in an auditorium named after the company’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, located on its campus in Cupertino, California. The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Cook into the hot seat. All the iPhone 17 models are still expected to be made in Apple’s manufacturing hubs in China and India, exposing them to some of Trump’s tariffs. Analysts believe the additional fees on iPhones coming into the U.S. increase the pressure on Apple to raise prices to help protect its profit margins on its most marquee product. Without giving a specific reason, Apple will charge $1,100 for the iPhone 17 Pro, an increase of $100, or 10%, from previous versions of that model. The iPhone Air will start at $1,000 — the price of last year’s iPhone 16 Pro. Apple is sticking with the same starting price for the basic iPhone 17 at $800 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,200. All four models will be in stores Sept. 19. Apple’s shares fell nearly 2% in Tuesday’s late afternoon trading. In a move aimed at the selfie culture, the iPhone 17 models will feature a front camera with more megapixels for crisper photos. The front camera will also have an option called “Center Stage” that will take advantage of a wider view of field and a new sensor that will enable users to take landscape photos without having to rotate the iPhone. Although most of the upgrades to the iPhone 17 are similar to the incremental improvements of recent years, Apple appears to have done enough to “bring a sense of newness to the iPhone, which has remained the same for too long,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore. While the iPhone 16 released last year fared reasonably well, the models didn’t sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all of the artificial intelligence features it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. The global trade war has compounded Apple’s challenges. Both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the U.S. instead of overseas. It’s an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone’s current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion i n the U.S. over the next four years, and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump’s most severe tariffs. However, with the iPhones being brought into the U.S. still facing duties of about 25%, some analysts speculated the company would raise prices to help preserve the its heft profit margins. But for the most part, Apple — and even rivals such as Google — is sticking with the same price tags it’s slapped on its newest iPhones over recent years. Although Apple’s stock price is still down by 4% so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won’t be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving $20 billion annually to lock in Google’s search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Here’s a look at everything that was announced, in order of when it was announced during the show. Apple redesigned AirPods Pro so they’re smaller and match more ears; Apple calls them the best-fitting AirPods ever. Apple also improved the audio with a wider soundstage and, more importantly, better active noise cancellation. Advanced computational audio, and new ear tips, offer better noise isolation—twice the ANC compared to the previous generation, and the best ANC in any wireless in-ear headphones, Apple promises, calling it over-the-ear performance in a pocket-sized design. Apple AirPods Pro 3 also supports live translation, so it can help you understand audio in your preferred language, say, if you’re wandering around a foreign country. ANC lowers the volume of the person speaking so it’s easier to focus on the translation. And it doesn’t just translate individual words, but complete phrases, so you can just speak naturally. Your phone will translate your words into their spoken language, if needed—and Apple says live language translation is even more powerful if both users are wearing AirPods Pro 3. AirPods Pro 3 also has a heart-rate sensor built-in. Thanks to the Apple Heart and Movement Study, which had over 250,000 participants, you can track up to 50 different workout types using just your headphones; no Watch necessary. You can track calories burned, and heart rate, using just your headphones and your phone’s Fitness app. Apple also promises more battery life: 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6. And, in transparency mode, when used as a hearing aid, AirPods Pro 3 can support up to 10 hours of battery life. Apple calls the Series 11 the most durable scratch-resistant Watch ever. It has more 5G coverage, is more battery-efficient, and comes with WatchOS 26 and the Liquid Glass design overhaul that comes with it. Series 11 also comes with new health features, including Health, Hearing, Cycle Tracking, Mental Health, and more. The Apple Watch Series 11 is attacking hypertension, also known as high blood pressure. Using data from the optical heart sensor, the Watch looks for high blood pressure over 30-day periods and will alert you if it spots patterns of hypertension. It won’t detect all instances, but Apple expects to notify over 1 million people of hypertension in the next year. It’ll be available in 150 regions this month, including the U.S. and Europe. Apple Watch Series 11 will also help you understand the quality of your sleep, thanks to a new Sleep Score feature. It can tell you about how long you slept, how it compares against your average, and measure any interruptions. Notably, the Apple Watch Series 11 has improved battery life: up to 24 hours. It comes in four colors: black, silver, gold, and space gray. There are new band colors and styles from Apple and Nike, and a new Hermes knit band with a special watch face that plays cute little animations. Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399. Apple also debuted a new Watch SE, called SE 3, which is the entry-level Watch the company sells. It comes with an always-on display for the first time, supports gestures so you can control the Watch with just one hand, offers wrist-temperature sensing (for women’s health in particular), and can play music through side speakers. It also supports fast charging for the first time, which means it’ll charge twice as fast as the last SE: 15 minutes of charging will give you 8 hours of life. It starts at $249. Apple’s highest-end Watch has an improved display that’s brighter when viewed at an angle, and thinner borders so you have a bigger screen without Apple needing to change the case size, making for the biggest Apple Watch display ever. It comes with better 5G support, but also satellite connectivity, so you can get emergency help you need, or send messages or share your location, even in remote areas. Apple doubled the signal strength so you can communicate with satellites 800 miles above Earth. Ultra 3 also comes with a larger battery that offers up to 42 hours of life. It comes in black and natural titanium colors, has new bands, and a rubber series of bands from Hermes. Apple Watch Ultra starts at $799. The iPhone 17 now features a 120 Hz ProMotion display, a feature previously reserved for the Pro iPhone models, which makes actions look and feel smooth. It also features an always-on display, and is the brightest screen ever and has less glare thanks to a 7-layer anti-reflective coating. It comes in five colors: white, black, green, purple, and blue. It also has the best scratch resistance in an iPhone. iPhone 17 is powered by an A19 chip, made with 3-nanometer technology, plus an improved neural engine for Apple Intelligence and higher memory bandwidth to make large language models run faster. It also has improved fast charging, so just 20 minutes of charge will give you 8 hours of video time. The iPhone 17 features a rear dual-camera system on the back. The ultra-wide camera now has a 48-megapixel lens, four times the resolution compared to the previous ultra-wide lens on the iPhone 16. On the front, Apple introduces Center Stage for its selfie camera with a sensor that’s almost twice the size of the previous iPhone 16 front-facing cam, allowing for high-resolution photos and videos in any orientation so you don’t need to rotate your iPhone to take a landscape selfie anymore. You can just tap your screen to go from landscape to portrait—and when it sees a lot of subjects on your screen, it automatically adjusts the camera to accommodate everyone. The iPhone 17 starts with 256 GB of storage on board. It starts at $799. You can learn more about it right here. It starts at $999. The 6.3-inch iPhone 17 Pro and 6.9-inch Pro Max is all about power. Apple used aerospace-grade aluminum alloy, for improved thermal conductivity, which also makes the phone significantly lighter to hold. It comes in silver, deep blue, and “cosmic orange.” Improved thermals also makes room for a bigger battery and better antenna system. Everything is done to unlock the potential of the A19 Pro, which is specially built for AI workloads. It has 40% better sustained performance than iPhone 16 Pro, according to Apple. Apple is now using ceramic shield, instead of glass, for the back, which is four times more resistant to cracks and allows for a thinner profile, which, again, allows room for a bigger battery. A 7-layer antireflective coating also makes the phone better in bright lighting conditions. Okay, so about that battery. It has the best life in any iPhone. For eSIM-only models, the battery is even bigger, giving you an additional 2 hours of additional video playback per charge, giving you 39 total hours of video playback. The iPhone 17 Pro camera system is highly versatile: It features a sensor that’s 56% larger than the previous generation, which allows for more light and detail in photos. Thanks to its 8X telephoto lens, Apple uses machine learning to preserve natural details, reduce noise, and result in significantly improved color accuracy, especially in low light. Apple is also adding support for ProRes RAW capture, the industry-leading Apple video codec that captures all the information from the camera sensor for post-production, ensuring control and quality. Apple said its entire presentation was actually shot with an iPhone 17 Pro camera. It also supports some nifty features like Genlock, which allows you to use multiple cameras to shoot motion at the same time so you can capture cool bullet-time effects. A new TechWoven case is available for the iPhone 17 Pro, as well as clear cases and colors in silicone. Yes, it also comes with a new body strap in case you want to wear your phone. The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099, and the Pro Max starts at $1,199. These product announcements come as Apple faces a ton of pressure from AI-hungry analysts, who aren’t thrilled with the pace at which Apple is bolstering its Apple Intelligence offering. For further context: Despite solid financial results, including record revenue in Q3, up 10% year-over-year, Apple’s had a mixed year in the markets as investor concerns about Apple’s AI capabilities have applied pressure on its stock. Apple, in case you don’t know, has chosen to pursue baking AI into its full software ecosystem that extends across devices rather than create a standalone app like ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity, which you can access in dedicated apps and websites including, notably, on non-Apple devices. On top of that, Apple admitted earlier this year at its Worldwide Developers Conference that its promised Siri overhaul for this year wouldn’t arrive until 2026. That delay cost Apple roughly $75 billion in market value in a single day and prompted some analysts to question CEO Tim Cook’s leadership. All of this to say: Wall Street is absolutely zeroed in on the AI gold rush right now and has grown impatient with Apple’s timeline on this front. What’s more, Apple says it’s facing an estimated $1.1 billion impact from tariffs in fiscal Q4 2025, adding cost pressures as it navigates component price increases. Goldman Sachs expects iPhone sales to grow 5% in fiscal 2025 and accelerate to 7% in 2026, assuming successful execution of today’s rumored product launches. Analyst sentiment remains mixed. While Goldman maintained its buy rating, MoffettNathanson argued that 30 times next year’s earnings is expensive for a company with “solid but not exceptional” growth prospects. The consensus among 31 Wall Street analysts shows a moderate buy rating. Apple’s strategy appears centered on hardware innovation bridging the gap until AI capabilities mature in 2026. But this approach carries inherent risks: if these products fail to drive expected upgrade cycles, the company could face continued underperformance relative to its AI-obsessed peers in Silicon Valley, many of whom are advancing their strategies and technologies more aggressively than Apple. Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft and others are pouring billions into AI facilities, and talent—and soon, hardware. Success for Apple would depend on whether consumers will accept higher prices for incremental improvements while Apple develops its next generation of software capabilities.

The new iPhones will be the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the US — a crusade that has thrust Apple CEO Tim Cook into the hot seat. If Apple follows the same naming scheme since the product's 2007 debut, the new models will be called the iPhone 17. But the Cupertino, California, company recently deviated from tradition with its naming formula for the iPhone operating system. When the next version of its iOS system was previewed at its developers conference in June, Apple revealed the free update will be called iOS 26 in reference to the upcoming year — a marketing technique that automakers have embraced for decades. Regardless, these new iPhones are still expected to be made in Apple's manufacturing hubs in China and India, much to the Trump administration's consternation. Both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the US instead of overseas. It's an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump's most severe tariffs. However, the iPhones being brought into the US still face duties of about 25 per cent, stoking speculation that the company will reveal its first across-the-board price increase in five years in an effort to preserve its hefty profit margins. Since 2020, Apple has charged $800 for its basic iPhone and $1,200 for its top offering, but analysts now believe the company may raise prices by $50 to $100 on some of the new models. If Apple does announce price increases, it will come just weeks after Google held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones. Whatever Apple ends up charging for the next iPhone, the new line-up isn't expected to be much different from last year's model — the first to be designed for a wide range of new artificial intelligence features. While the iPhone 16 has proven to be popular, the models didn't sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all the AI-fueled improvements it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. That has lowered the expectations for this year's line-up, which will likely include the usual improvements in camera quality and battery life on top of a slightly redesigned appearance. The most significant new twist could be the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone dubbed “Air” — a moniker Apple already slaps on like its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. The relatively minor updates to recent iPhone models are raising questions about Apple's ability to innovate in the fast-moving era of AI, said Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Apple is reaching a tipping point, and I expect 2026 and 2027 to be pivotal years." Apple's AI follies, combined with its exposure in Trump's trade war, have weighed on the company's stock, while the market values of Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet have been surging. Although Apple's stock price is still down by 4 per cent so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won't be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving USD 20 billion annually to lock in Google's search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Jeremy here again, filling in for Andrew, who is at Fortune Brainstorm Tech in Deer Valley, Utah. The conference kicked off yesterday, and man, I’ve got serious FOMO.Some highlights so far: But the big news in tech today, aside from what’s happening at Fortune Brainstorm Tech, of course, is anticipation around Apple’s big hardware reveal later today. iPhone fans—and Apple investors—have great expectations. Will Apple live up to them? Bea Nolan has a rundown below of what we might see unveiled. One thing analysts are cautioning we probably won’t see: a lot of those native AI features Apple has been promising iPhone users for more than a year now.Always leave ‘em wanting more may be good showbiz advice, but it might not do Apple’s share price any favors. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple is set to unveil its latest iPhone in an “awe-dropping” event later today. The company is hosting its annual product launch in Cupertino where it's slated to launch major hardware refreshes across its lineup and debut the brand new iPhone 17 family. The company is also expected to launch updates to the iPad Pro, Vision Pro headset, Apple TV, and HomePod mini and reveal the iPhone 17 Air, set to be the thinnest iPhone to date. Apple has been navigating a complex political environment, and some analysts expect the tech giant to raise prices on the Pro models as the company deals with a challenging tariff environment. Analysts have also cautioned against expecting a major AI announcement during the event. “Apple has already shared that a major Siri and Apple Intelligence revamp will only happen in 2026 and, timing-wise, it’s unlikely a major strategic investment in an AI firm would coincide with Apple’s keynote next week,” Forrester’s Thomas Husson noted. Instead, he said Apple is more likely to spotlight its new A19 Pro chip, which features a more powerful Neural Engine for on-device AI tasks like conversational models, advanced photo editing, and personalized suggestions. A fresh AI partnership with Google’s Gemini could also surface, building on last year’s tie-up with ChatGPT. The show kicks off at 10 a.m. PT. —Beatrice Nolan OpenAI is scrambling to salvage its corporate restructuring after facing unexpected opposition, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal report. The company is even considering the "nuclear option" of leaving California entirely, though a spokesperson denied any plans to relocate. The stakes couldn't be higher: about $19 billion in funding—nearly half of what OpenAI raised in the past year—depends on investors getting traditional equity in a new for-profit structure. Currently, OpenAI issues "profit participation units" instead of traditional stock, but investors want real equity. If the restructuring collapses, those investors can pull their money—a potentially catastrophic blow for a company planning to burn through $115 billion by 2029. OpenAI now faces a coalition of dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and philanthropies opposing the move, plus a legal challenge from Elon Musk. Meta has been lobbying to block the deal too, the Journal reports. Both California and Delaware attorneys general are investigating the restructuring, with concerns about recent suicides linked to ChatGPT interactions complicating approval. Regulators are questioning whether OpenAI has abandoned its original public benefit mission for revenue. The AGs could sue or demand hefty settlements as conditions for approval. OpenAI executives didn't anticipate this backlash, according to the Journal, and are now scrambling to save the deal, hiring advisers with ties to Governor Newsom while pledging $50 million to community organizations.—Jeremy Kahn Two former and two current Meta employees have submitted documents to Congress alleging that Meta curtailed research into children’s safety, according to a report from The Washington Post. The employees allege that after Frances Haugen’s 2021 leaks, Meta quietly limited how staff could study sensitive issues like youth well-being, race, and harassment. They allege Meta’s lawyers advised researchers to avoid collecting data on minors and even urged them to run sensitive studies under attorney-client privilege. One researcher says he was ordered to delete an interview in which a teen described his 10-year-old brother being sexually propositioned in Horizon Worlds. Meta told news outlets the deletion was required under privacy law, citing rules that ban collecting information from children under 13 without verified parental consent. Meta has denied the rest of the claims, saying the allegations were “stitched together. The company also said it had approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being, since 2022. A Senate subcommittee is set to review the whistleblowers’ claims this week. —Beatrice Nolan The judge overseeing Anthropic’s proposed settlement with authors has blasted the agreement as “nowhere close to complete.” Judge William Alsup said at a Monday hearing that he felt “misled” by the settlement proposal and had “an uneasy feeling about hangers on with all this money on the table.” He cited concerns about class lawyers striking a deal behind the scenes that will later be forced “down the throat of authors.” The motion to approve the deal was denied, and a post-hearing order stated that approval is postponed until more information is provided. Attorneys will now have to return with a revised settlement proposal. As part of this, the judge directed the parties to create a form requiring all copyright owners to opt in to the settlement; if any owner opts out, that work will be excluded. Judge Alsup set a September 15 deadline for submitting a final list of works, which currently stands at just under 500,000. The $1.5 billion settlement had already been touted as one of the largest copyright deals in U.S. history, and experts say it could establish a benchmark for similar cases. —Beatrice Nolan Anthropic endorses California’s AI safety bill. It’s the first major AI company to back the bill. Trump’s tech dinner triggers a MAGA backlash. Tech bosses spike tensions in MAGA land. SpaceX to acquire EchoStar Spectrum in $17B deal. The deal will allow EchoStar to resolve a regulatory probe. A former WhatsApp security chief has sued Meta, alleging ignored privacy risks. WhatsApp called the claims false and tied to poor performance. Google says the open web is already in “rapid decline.”The statement starkly contrasts Google’s recent claims about the health of web search. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Massive AI salaries and RTO are fueling a real estate boom in San Francisco: 'It's going to rain money'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-money-rto-real-estate-boom-san-francisco-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-09T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The AI boom has lit a fuse under San Francisco's housing market, with prices and rents inflamed by a tech workforce increasingly returning to the office, and as the AI talent wars push salaries to dizzying highs. Tech workers are flocking to the Bay Area to work at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Nvidia after the region was dealt a massive blow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Real estate agents say RTO is fueling the resurgence, with AI being particularly synonymous with in-person work and hardcore culture. What's more, tech workers, especially those working in AI, are commanding massive salaries, including multimillion-dollar compensation packages. The salary needed to afford a home in the San Jose metro area — which encompasses Silicon Valley and the headquarters for Meta, Google, and Nvidia — crossed the $400,000 threshold for the first time in April 2024, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist — "an inconceivable amount of money unless you work in AI, and those salaries are probably more common." This makes it the most expensive metro area in the US. Home prices in the San Jose metro area are up 3% year-over-year, according to Redfin. While big AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic aren't public, employees can tap equity during stock sales on the private market. One former OpenAI employee, who requested anonymity to speak about personal matters, told Business Insider they purchased a home in San Francisco during the company's last tender and knew of at least four others who did the same. "It's definitely the popular move, and people are talking about it again," they said. The luxury housing market in San Francisco is also setting records. More homes sold above $20 million in the city last year than ever before, according to Sotheby's 2025 Mid-Year Luxury Outlook report, which its international realty chief marketing officer, A. Bradley Nelson, attributed largely to AI's rise. Another Bay Area county, San Mateo County, nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is seeing record prices for single-family homes — $2.6 million on average this year, according to MLS data. This boom is fueled by both the rise of AI and the strength of the stock market, said Raziel Ungar, a San Mateo County real estate agent who has worked with Big Tech buyers working at Oracle, Google, and Apple. "There's been so much wealth that's been created in the last few years, in particular in the Valley, that it's pushed our prices higher," Ungar said. San Francisco real estate agent Ruth Krishnan has worked with several OpenAI employees who have cashed out during tender offers to make down payments on homes, she said. Krishnan likened the current "level of frenzy" to the period before Facebook's IPO in 2012, with homebuying anticipation fueling rapid transactions and swaths of competitive offers on each property. With news of OpenAI's latest $10.3 billion secondary share sale, "it's going to rain money in SF," she said. AI workers are quickly adapting to newfound wealth. A second former OpenAI employee said that when they first moved to San Francisco, they lived in a group house and paid roughly $1,200 a month in rent. Now, former colleagues frequent Michelin-starred restaurants and wear luxury goods. "They have massive bag collections, they have upgraded their houses, and everything," the second former employee said. "It feels more like a normal tech company or even kind of like finance in some ways." The rental market is also rocketing. Rents across the San Francisco metro area are up about 5% since last year — double the pace of national growth, a Zillow representative told Business Insider. Apartment hunters are handing out "tenant résumés" at packed showings, making offers site unseen, offering several months of rent in advance, or coming in at thousands of dollars over the asking price, The San Francisco Standard previously reported. In terms of specific San Francisco neighborhoods, Mission Bay is central to AI activity, Krishnan said, while the Hayes Valley neighborhood has been dubbed "Cerebral Valley." Other desirable neighborhoods for those in the field include South Beach, Dogpatch, Potrero Hill, the Mission, Noe Valley, and Bernal Heights, Krishnan said. Despite their eye-popping salaries, the average AI homebuyer tends to be more pragmatic, real estate agents said. They're "data-driven and decisive," said San Francisco real estate agent Danielle Lazier, adding that many clients "model payments, taxes, and micro-market evaluations with large language models before touring." While the single-family home market is "on fire" and condos are "perking up," Lazier said a full pre-COVID recovery hasn't yet been attained. Krishnan agreed that buyers in AI aren't "going crazy," adding that a typical purchase ranges from $2 million to $4 million — still a relatively staggering sum. The AI wave is nascent, and while many of her clients are young, they're aware of past tech busts, she said. "They're being very cautious about what if this doesn't last forever," she said. "They've heard of people who thought that they had all this money that then disappeared, and it seems to be top of mind for them, actually. So they're not overspending. They're cautiously spending."

Title: Apple to unveil next iPhone amid Trump trade war that could result in higher prices

Time Published: 2025-09-09T05:54:14Z

Apple on Tuesday will unveil its next line-up of iPhones amid a global trade war that’s added a potential price increase to the usual intrigue surrounding the annual evolution of the company’s marquee product Apple has unveiled its new iPhones 17 lineup, along with updates to its digital watches and AirPod products at its annual September product launch. The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Apple CEO Tim Cook into the hot seat. The new devices come with a larger, 6.3-inch display and is powered by a new a A19 chip to help power Apple's AI features. The iPhone 17’s front camera has also been upgraded to have a wider field of view and new sensor, allowing you to take landscape photos without having to rotate your phone The new devices are still expected to be made in Apple's manufacturing hubs in China and India, much to the Trump administration's consternation. Both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the U.S. instead of overseas. It's an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion i n the U.S. over the next four years, and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump's most severe tariffs. However, the iPhones being brought into the U.S. still face duties of about 25%, stoking speculation that the company will reveal its first across-the-board price increase in five years in an effort to preserve its hefty profit margins. Since 2020, Apple has charged $800 for its basic iPhone and $1,200 for its top offering, but analysts now believe the company may raise prices by $50 to $100 on some of the new models. If Apple does announce price increases, it will come just weeks after Google held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones. Although Apple's stock price is still down by 4% so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won't be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving $20 billion annually to lock in Google's search engine as the default option on iPhones. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

In a new annual company letter, CEO Evan Spiegel just announced the company is restructuring around small “startup squads” of 10 to 15 people to better compete against larger competitors. The move comes as the 5,000-person company faces mounting pressure. Advertising revenue growth flatlined at 4% in the second quarter, and North American daily active users declined 2% to 98 million, a troubling sign in Snap’s most important market. Spiegel does highlight one bright spot: Snapchat+ subscriptions now generate over $700 million in annual recurring revenue from more than 15 million paying subscribers, making direct revenue “one of Snap’s fastest-growing opportunities.” Snap is also doubling down on Specs, building its own AR glasses that Spiegel envisions will replace smartphones entirely. He calls them a “a once-in-a-generation transformation towards human-centered computing.” (Meta and Google see the same future, partnering with Ray-Ban and Warby Parker, respectively.) Spiegel acknowledges the current stock price “reflects doubt” but writes that there’s “startup-style return potential” at Snap’s roughly $12 billion valuation. Left unsaid: that number is down 90% from September 2021, when Snap’s market cap topped $116 billion during the height of social media mania.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: AI factories, custom silicon deals and the race for infrastructure scale

Time Published: 2025-09-08T17:26:46Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 13:26 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 by Chad Wilson Artificial intelligence is no longer just a software story — it is the foundation for AI factories, where chips, data pipelines and networks work together as production systems for digital outcomes. This emerging model is redefining how performance is measured and how value is created across industries. These AI factories combine custom semiconductors, low-latency fabrics and massive data instrumentation into real-time feedback loops that generate competitive advantage. They are reshaping business models as chipmakers secure long-term custom contracts and enterprises harness telemetry to transform traditional experiences into living, digital ecosystems. The economics of compute now rival the economics of manufacturing. This framing sets the stage for the latest episode of theCUBE Pod with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right), who explored how Broadcom Inc., Nvidia Corp. and IBM Corp. are navigating this shift. Their conversation ranged from real-time analytics at the U.S. Open to the rise of custom silicon deals and the broader race to scale AI-powered infrastructure. “This is going to be a continuing boom for the Broadcoms and the Nvidias because they’re the arms dealers and the supply chain,” Furrier said. “Nvidia is going after the enterprise. Broadcom is taking more of an open approach.” The concept of AI factories came up repeatedly as a lens for interpreting today’s market. The phrase underscores that compute resources are not abstract tools, but production lines for data-driven outcomes. Broadcom and Nvidia illustrate two ends of this spectrum. Nvidia pursues a vertically integrated model where hardware, software and systems are tightly coupled. Broadcom takes a modular approach, pursuing multi-year custom silicon deals while pairing semiconductors with software to balance cycles, according to Vellante. “They’ve turned the US open into an AI data factory,” he said about theCUBE’s recent attendance at the sporting event. “They don’t use that marketing. That’s Dell and Nvidia, but it really is a data factory. They’ve got over a hundred years of matched data. They got all the history on where the balls lands. The note I have here is four and a half million data points per match and it’s unbelievable.” The US Open became a showcase of AI factory economics, with IBM’s watsonx processing millions of data points in near real time across 17 courts. Broadcom’s $16 billion quarter underscored the same theme: Long-term chip deals and capital-intensive ecosystems are redefining vendor strategies, customer experiences and enterprise value, Furrier explained. “The OpenAI deal represents what I call the white box model for the large-scale clusters, which is simply there will be a market that will rise up to feed the demand for essentially custom chips that will feed into what could be a clone of Nvidia, meaning purpose-built systems,” he said. “OpenAI had a huge incentive in cash to vertically integrate their own. We’ve been having this debate, heterogeneous versus homogenous.” Beyond the headlines on earnings and chip design, the broader conversation centered on how ecosystems evolve. AI factories are not just hyperscaler phenomena. Their influence touches enterprises through partnerships, data integration strategies and the application of agentic workflows. That’s why upcoming conversations in the AI factories series are significant: They extend the debate from chips and cloud clusters into enterprise readiness, interoperability and governance, Vellante emphasized. “Broadcom … almost $16 billion in revenue, up 23% in the quarter. That’s just the quarter, operating income at six billion, almost 37% of revenue,” he said in reference to their place in the industry. “Their free cash flow is $7 billion, 45% of revenue — that’s higher than Microsoft; that’s higher than Nvidia. The thing about Broadcom … they have these long duration, high value, multi-year, multi-billion-dollar custom chip deals.” Nvidia’s integrated approach, framed by “Jensen’s Law,” highlights doubling performance annually, though its enterprise impact remains in question. Both Nvidia and Broadcom are benefiting from AI demand, while Salesforce Inc., IBM and others push agentic, data-driven growth. Yet Wall Street often overlooks these strategies, underscoring why financial and technical roadmaps remain inseparable. “I would say that Nvidia’s on the learning curve and Nvidia’s ahead of everybody to the extent that you need the latest greatest,” Vellante explained. “They are furthest along on the learning curve, which means they have the most innovation and the lowest cost, not the lowest price of course, but that’s their moat. I see it continuing for quite some time unless and until those laws become non-immutable.” Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI David Sacks, White House AI and crypto czar Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Jim Cramer, American TV personality and author Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM Bruno Aziza, group VP, data, BI and AI at IBM Aaron Rakers, managing director and technology analyst at Wells Fargo Pat Gelsinger, former CEO of Intel Paul Maritz, chairman at Pivotal and former CEO of VMware Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Sarbjeet Johal, founder and CEO of Stackpane Jonathan Cantor, SVP and deputy chief privacy officer of Truist Lina Khan, former chair of the FTC Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Janet Reno, former U.S. attorney general Jack Ma, Chinese business magnate and investor Donald Trump, 45th and 47th president of the United States of America Here’s the full episode of this week’s theCUBE Pod: Don’t miss out on the latest episodes of “theCUBE Pod.” Join us by subscribing to our RSS feed.

UPDATED 12:08 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are locked in a zero-sum battle for artificial intelligence data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. Nvidia has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the internet. In this Breaking Analysis, we examine the different strategies of Broadcom and Nvidia and explain why the success of one doesn’t necessarily mean dilution to the others’ prospects. Nvidia’s strategy is straightforward in concept but extraordinarily difficult to replicate. The company builds a full-stack platform that starts with graphics processing units and extends across the system. Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that the unit of competition is no longer the chip, but the system or what Nvidia coined as the AI factory. Nvidia has positioned itself as the indispensable supplier for anyone looking to stand up these factories. At the core of Nvidia’s stack are GPUs such as Hopper and Blackwell, paired with NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects to form tightly coupled compute domains. These “pods” scale to 72 GPUs, creating high-bandwidth, low-latency islands optimized for extreme parallel processing workloads such as AI training. Nvidia extends these pods outward using InfiniBand, a proprietary network technology it captured from its Mellanox acquisition. In addition, Nvidia leverages its Spectrum-X Ethernet, a purpose-built Ethernet fabric designed to handle AI traffic deterministically. On top of the hardware sits its CUDA software stack and hundreds of libraries that represent the software glue that makes these systems programmable and highly tuned. Nvidia’s software moat is deep, with tens of thousands of developers locked into its ecosystem and wide supporting a virtually infinite number of use cases. In addition, the company offers systems and services such as DGX, NIMS inference microservices and Omniverse for simulation and digital twins, further solidifying its position as a platform, not just a chip supplier. The cadence of innovation is relentless. Each year, Nvidia launches new architectures that deliver better performance per watt and higher utilization of the cluster. This annual rhythm turns capital spending into a recurring monetization cycle. The result, when power is a constraint and systems are underutilized, is that customers spend more, generate more tokens per watt, and reduce unit cost at scale. Broadcom’s approach is significantly different from that of Nvidia. Chief Executive Hock Tan and Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, are not chasing GPUs or building giant AI systems. Instead, Broadcom’s playbook is to identify durable franchises – markets with a decade or more of runway – establish technology leadership, and run them with intense operating discipline. Some investors have shied away from Broadcom citing it as a “commodity player.” In our view, this narrative is misguided and lacks an understanding of the engineering investments required to deliver the products Broadcom produces, including in its wireless portfolio. In semiconductors, Broadcom has staked its claim in connectivity. Its Tomahawk and Jericho families dominate merchant Ethernet switching. It has also secured custom silicon design wins with Google, Meta and likely ByteDance, embedding Broadcom deep into the hyperscale AI buildout. These are multibillion-dollar, long-duration deals that are highly strategic. The company just announced it closed another $10 billion custom chip deal, widely known to be with OpenAI, which, like the hyperscalers, is designing its own chips to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. On the last earnings call, Tan had what appeared to be an inadvertent and ironic “tell” saying the following: Today’s AI rack scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk 5 with OpenAI — with open Ethernet, sorry, which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. This slip of the tongue came right after he announced the most recent $10 billion custom chip deal, leading many observers, including us, to conclude that OpenAI was clearly embedded (in a good way) in Tan’s head space. Charlie Kawwas’ mantra is “OSP.” It stands for open, scalable, power-efficient and frames Broadcom’s philosophy. The company bets that open standards such as Ethernet and PCIe will ultimately win out over proprietary approaches such as InfiniBand and NVLink. History suggests this is a good bet, which is why Nvidia has also embraced Ethernet. In software, Broadcom has reshaped VMware around VMware Cloud Foundation, announcing VCF 9.0 claiming the integration of all those disparate VMware software modules was achieved with thousands of engineers creating the bundle. Broadcom’s strategy to force customers into higher-value contracts, though controversial, has driven operating margins above 70% and gross margins over 90%, substantially better than other software-as-a-service gross margins. Moreover, VMware has become the most robust on-premises alternative to public cloud and represents the most mature private cloud offering on the market, in our view. The quirk of Broadcom’s VMware strategy is that alternatives such as Hyper-V, Nutanix, Red Hat and others have gained momentum, where previously they were shut out as virtualization plays. Broadcom doesn’t want the customers unwilling to pay up for the full VCF stack, but alternative players that don’t have nearly the profitability profile of Broadcom are happy to take the business. The graphic below shows Enterprise Technology Research’s Net Score methodology for the virtualization market. The vertical axis (Net Score) represents the net percentage of customers spending more on each platform and the horizontal axis shows penetration into the data set. The data would lead one to believe that VMware is struggling, noting its precipitous drop from January 2023. But the methodology doesn’t capture amount of spend. As such, it misses the fact that Broadcom’s strategy has been to focus its efforts more narrowly on those high value customers willing to spend on the whole VCF bundle to lower total cost of ownership. This is a classic Broadcom move. It only competes in markets where it can dominate. In the case of VMware, it’s not the number of logos that matters, rather its the number of customers that willing to absorb price increases and buy the full bundle. Contrary to many misguided narratives, Broadcom invests heavily in engineering and surrounds its platform with critical technologies that drive clear return on investment. This is why (for example) even Nvidia buys networking technologies from Broadcom. The bottom line is that Broadcom doesn’t need to win in GPUs head-to-head with Nvidia to thrive. Instead, it supplies the glue — SerDes, NICs, optics and switches — that make large AI systems possible. In Kawwas’ words, Broadcom doesn’t make GPUs, it makes the stuff that makes XPUs and HBMs work. In addition, it has secured multibillion-dollar, long-duration contracts to build custom AI chips for some of the top companies in the world, including Google, Meta, ByteDance and now OpenAI. A major flashpoint between the two companies is the question of scale. On Broadcom’s most recent earnings call, Tan depositioned Nvidia’s NVLink 72 as “scaling up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabits per second,” contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet fabrics that can connect 512 nodes using Tomahawk 5. At face value, this makes Nvidia’s approach sound limited. But the comparison is misleading in our view. The way we interpret Nvidia’s use of the “scale up, out, across” terminology is as follows: Broadcom, in Tan’s remark, appears to have used “scale up” more loosely to mean “supporting larger clusters than 72 GPUs.” But technically, connecting 512 compute nodes with Ethernet is a scale-out fabric, not scale-up. In particular, scale-up is generally thought of as making a single logical system bigger by tightly coupling components. Think symmetric multiprocessing in a single box. In our view, Tan was depositioning NVLink’s rack-level island (72 GPUs) as small, contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet-based ability to connect hundreds of nodes. In doing so, he takes liberty with the terminology, calling Ethernet’s cluster expansion “scale up,” when in fact in classic parlance it’s scale-out. In contrast, Nvidia’s 72 GPUs refers to a tightly coupled NVLink domain where high-bandwidth memory pools are shared across GPUs, enabling highly efficient parallel operations. Broadcom’s 512 nodes really refers to the scale-out capability of Ethernet fabrics. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The two approaches solve different problems. NVLink maximizes performance within a rack, while Ethernet extends clusters across racks and rows. The tradeoff is that NVLink delivers peak performance per GPU, Ethernet delivers estate-level scalability and economics. In practice, operators use both – NVLink for high-performance compute islands, Ethernet for stitching those islands together. The financial models of Nvidia and Broadcom underscore their different strategies. On the surface, both companies post extraordinary results, but the way they get there is different. Nvidia today is running at a revenue pace of roughly $187 billion annually, up an impressive 56% year-over-year. Despite moderating from the triple-digit growth rates of prior quarters, this remains one of the fastest growth profiles of any mega-cap. Margins are equally impressive: 73% gross, 65% operating and 33% operating cash flow. With a market capitalization north of $4 trillion and a 22x run rate revenue multiple, Nvidia is being valued as a once-in-a-generation growth company, not a traditional semiconductor provider. In our view, this reflects investor conviction that Nvidia’s full-stack AI factory strategy has years of runway left, with annual cadence upgrades, CUDA software lock-in and hyperscaler demand elasticity sustaining momentum. And an economic value proposition that is compelling when power is the limiting factor and utilization/efficiency improvements can be achieved with rapid tech refreshes. In its recent earnings call, Nvidia stressed the ramp of Blackwell, with NVLink 72 deployments showing 10x efficiency gains on reasoning workloads compared with Hopper. Management highlighted that inference is now a meaningful revenue stream, alongside training. In terms of ROI, elasticity (Jevons paradox) is allowing Nvidia to cut price per token while still growing revenue. Broadcom, by contrast, is delivering exceptional results with a different playbook. The company is operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $64 billion, growing a solid but more measured 22% year-over-year. This past quarter its non-AI semiconductor offerings were a headwind, but they’re expected to grow sequentially. Broadcom’s gross margin of 67% is lower than Nvidia’s, but Broadcom shines in cash generation, with 45% operating cash flow margin – a remarkable figure given the scale of the business. Operating margin sits at 37%, well below Nvidia’s, but consistent with Broadcom’s blend of semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its valuation, at roughly $1.6 trillion market cap and a 25x revenue multiple, is notable. Investors are waking up to Broadcom, not for its hypergrowth, but for its durability, discipline and strategic positioning as the connective tissue for AI infrastructure, the go-to firm for custom AI chips and the value creator of its VMware asset. Broadcom’s recent earnings highlighted Tomahawk 5’s ability to scale clusters well beyond the NVLink pod size. We note the caveats to Tan’s statements, as cited earlier. Tan reiterated that VMware Cloud Foundation adoption is ahead of schedule, with software margins approaching 70%. AI silicon revenue run-rate hit ~$16 billion, anchored by custom hyperscaler wins and an exciting $10 billion deal widely reported to be with OpenAI. In our opinion, these financial metrics underscore Nvidia as a hypergrowth platform company trading at a premium for its velocity, while Broadcom is a durable compounder valued for its consistency, cash flows and long-term franchises. Both models are exceptional, both companies are fundamental to the AI movement, but they reflect entirely different philosophies of how to capture value in the AI era. We believe the implications of these strategies are meaningful in the sense that: In our opinion, the market should stop framing Broadcom and Nvidia as rivals in a zero-sum contest. Moreover, the idea that Broadcom is a commodity play, as posited by some pundits, is absurd in our view. Nvidia and Broadcom are playing different games, both of which are essential to the AI era. Nvidia builds the compute engines and software platforms that drive new workloads. Broadcom ensures those engines can scale, interconnect and operate profitably over a decade-long horizon. Our research suggests that as AI moves from cloud to enterprise to real-world systems, both Nvidia and Broadcom will expand their moats in very different, but highly synergistic ways. The real battle is not between them, but between this new architecture and the legacy compute stack it is replacing.

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/07/job-growth-sputters-rate-cuts-and-recession-incoming/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.
