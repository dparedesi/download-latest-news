We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. In this section of the November 2025 episode of FO° Exclusive, Atul Singh and Glenn Carle examine growing fears that the US stock market has become detached from economic reality. Inequality, weakening consumer demand and policy time lags now increase systemic risk. Mounting fiscal strain, tariff uncertainty and global diversification away from the dollar make a significant market correction increasingly plausible. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Editor-in-Chief Atul Singh and FOI Senior Partner Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who now advises companies, governments and organizations on geopolitical risk, discuss rising fears of a US stock market bubble, with particular attention to technology and artificial intelligence. Their concern is not simply that equities are expensive, but that today’s valuations reflect expectations the real economy may be unable to meet. Drawing on warnings by market experts, fiscal data and consumer indicators, they argue that the American economy is showing strains beneath the surface while markets continue to price in near-perfect economic conditions. The gap between financial optimism and economic reality, they suggest, is widening dangerously. The AI boom and extreme market concentration Atul opens by highlighting warnings from Albert Edwards, the global strategist at French bank Société Générale, who sees the US equity market — especially tech and AI stocks — in the midst of a classic bubble. Some major technology firms are trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings, a level Atul calls “a ridiculous figure.” These valuations, Edwards argues, leave little margin for error. The discussion stresses that such optimism depends on extraordinary assumptions. Citing estimates from JPMorgan Chase, Atul notes that for companies to earn a 10% return on projected AI capital expenditure by 2030, they would collectively need around $650 billion in annual AI revenues — roughly $400 per year from every iPhone user. While some fund managers remain bullish, arguing AI-led productivity gains justify this optimism, many investors view the revenue assumptions as implausible. Market gains are also highly concentrated. Roughly 60% of recent stock market growth has come from just seven firms: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The remaining 40% of the market is up as well, but far less dramatically. This concentration amplifies systemic risk, as any correction among a handful of firms could reverberate across the entire market. Inequality, consumers and the fragile base of demand The US economy ultimately depends on consumer demand, even if that reality is often obscured by soaring asset prices. Glenn underlines that consumption today is increasingly driven by the wealthy. Around 80–86% of the gains from recent tax cuts have flowed to the top 1% of Americans, while the bottom 80% have seen little or no growth in disposable income for years. This imbalance matters because wealthy households cannot replace mass demand. Glenn sums it up starkly: “1,000 billionaires cannot buy as many cars as 100 million lower-middle-class Americans.” If middle- and lower-middle-class consumers cannot afford homes, cars or basic goods, economic momentum weakens regardless of stock prices. Atul turns the conversation to the declining role of entrepreneurs. Building small, innovative firms has become much more difficult as large corporations dominate markets. Historically, smaller companies have driven job creation and experimentation in both the US and Europe. Their erosion, Glenn adds, pushes the economy toward oligopoly — less competition, weaker innovation and slower long-term growth. Time lags, tariffs and mounting economic strain A central theme of the discussion is what Glenn calls the “lag factor” in economic policy. Despite commentators’ claims that new tariffs have had little immediate impact, policy effects take time. Even small changes in short-term interest rates can take around six months to affect the economy, while longer-term rates and fiscal measures often take 18 months or more. Dismissing these delays may prove dangerous. Although tariff revenues have risen and trade flows have not collapsed, uncertainty itself is already affecting behavior. CEOs faced with shifting rules and arbitrary implementation hesitate to make long-term investment decisions. Supporters inside the Trump administration counter by likening the US market to a Disneyland theme park, arguing that trading partners will continue to accept lower margins because there is no substitute — a view closely associated with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who administration insiders credit with engineering a delicate balancing act between trade pressure and market stability. Supporters also point to the US–China trade deal, which they argue removed Chinese export controls on rare earths, halted retaliation against US semiconductor firms and reopened Chinese markets to American agricultural exports. Critics respond that this confidence underestimates how quickly countries adapt when costs rise. Glenn points to rising housing costs, weak youth employment, a growing deficit and slowing construction as indicators of a slowdown in the economy. Atul reinforces this view with insider insights from within Washington, DC. Sources in the US Treasury worry not just about tariffs, but about affordability, cost-of-living pressures and weakening demand. Meanwhile, headline fiscal numbers are troubling. US debt is projected to exceed that of Italy and Greece for the first time this century, while the budget deficit remains near 6% in peacetime. Demand, dislocation and a possible crash Beyond near-term indicators, Atul and Glenn raise a deeper structural concern: demand in an AI-driven economy. Even if AI significantly boosts production and efficiency, it may also displace jobs faster than new ones emerge. Atul likens the situation to the late 1920s, when productivity surged, but demand failed to keep pace, ending in a market collapse. Signs of stress are already showing. University of Michigan consumer confidence fell to 50.3 in November, the second-worst reading ever recorded — worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 Covid-19 downturn. Household balance sheets are also deteriorating: roughly 4.5% of US household debt is now delinquent, while student-loan delinquencies have reached record levels. Youth unemployment has climbed above 8%, and job-search times are lengthening. Simultaneously, while the dollar remains the world’s main trading currency, it is declining as a store of value. Central banks and investors are diversifying away from the mighty greenback. Even allies like Canada are actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US market through shifting trade, tourism and even defense procurement decisions. Importantly, rising market volatility presents a major risk, with the Cboe Volatility Index crossing the 20 mark, signaling higher-than-normal expected market volatility and increased investor uncertainty or fear Investors and economists are increasingly talking of an impending crash. These predictions might be a bit too pessimistic, but dismissing them would be reckless. As Atul puts it, “just because there’s a lot of talk about it doesn’t mean that it is all talk.” Together, the indicators paint a consistent picture: an irrational exuberance in markets, an economy under increasing strains and a growing risk that economic realities upend ebullient markets.

Title: The Reverse-Centaur's Guide to Criticizing AI

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I gave a speech for the University of Washington's "Neuroscience, AI and Society" lecture series, through the university's Computational Neuroscience Center. It was called "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI," and it's based on the manuscript for my next book, "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Life After AI," which will be out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux next June: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139 The talk was sold out, but here's the text of my lecture. I'm very grateful to UW for the opportunity, and for a lovely visit to Seattle! == I'm a science fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. What I don't do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean that what we all do couldn't change it. It would mean that the future was arriving on fixed rails and couldn't be steered. Jesus Christ, what a miserable proposition! Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think sf writers are oracles, soothsayers. Unfortunately, even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that they can "see the future." But for every sf writer who deludes themselves into thinking that they are writing the future, there are a hundred sf fans who believe that they are reading the future, and a depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. The fact that these guys can't shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI. That's a thing I strenuously resisted doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentless bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn't understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, insisted that I must be a paid shill. This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is Just. Too. Short. So I didn't want to get lured into another one of those quagmires, because on the one hand, I just don't think AI is that important of a technology, and on the other hand, I have very nuanced and complicated views about what's wrong, and not wrong, about AI, and it takes a long time to explain that stuff. But people wouldn't stop asking, so I did what I always do. I wrote a book. Over the summer I wrote a book about what I think about AI, which is really about what I think about AI criticism, and more specifically, how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: "How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm." I titled the book The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish it in June, 2026. But you don't have to wait until then because I am going to break down the entire book's thesis for you tonight, over the next 40 minutes. I am going to talk fast. # Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a "centaur" is a person who is assisted by a machine. You're a human head being carried around on a tireless robot body. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete. And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine. Like an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras, that monitor the driver's eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver's mouth because singing isn't allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they don't make quota. The driver is in that van because the van can't drive itself and can't get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance. But the driver is human, so the van doesn't just use the driver. The van uses the driver up. Obviously, it's nice to be a centaur, and it's horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaur-like, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse-centaurs, which is something none of us want to be. But like I said, the job of an sf writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it's technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it's technologically impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you think that it's impossible for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite. This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher's mantra was "There is no alternative." She repeated this so often they called her "TINA" Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative. TINA. "There is no alternative" is a cheap rhetorical slight. It's a demand dressed up as an observation. "There is no alternative" means "STOP TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE." Which, you know, fuck that. I'm an sf writer, my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast. So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality, and explain how I think we could and should all be better AI critics. # Start with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don't compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels. Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20 billion/year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% Search market-share. Now, you'd think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector. But it's actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a "growth stock," and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you're making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the "price to earnings ratio" or "P/E ratio." But once a company stops growing, it is a "mature" stock, and it trades at a much lower P/E ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth ten dollars. It has a P/E ratio of 10, while Amazon has a P/E ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36. It's wonderful to run a company that's got a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company, or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeroes into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors. So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition, or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeroes into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us, or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars. That's the upside of having a growth stock. But here's the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you gonna grow? Once the market decides that you aren't a growth stock, once you become mature, your stock is revalued, to a P/E ratio befitting a mature stock. If you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you're not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the USA than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240B sell off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history. That's a monopolist's worst nightmare, because once you're presiding over a "mature" firm, the key employees you've been compensating with stock, experience a precipitous pay-drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars. With dollars, not shares. And the same goes for acquiring companies that might help you grow, because they, too, are going to expect money, not stock. This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they don't trust your pricing power. Which is why growth stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video, or cryptocurrency, or NFTs, or Metaverse, or AI. I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. So this is why they're hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment. # Now I want to talk about how they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use "disrupt" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense. The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company. That's it. That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security. Now, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We'd have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people. But AI can't do your job. It can help you do your job, but that doesn't mean it's going to save anyone money. Take radiology: there's some evidence that AIs can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss, and look, I've got cancer. Thankfully, it's very treatable, but I've got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible. If my Kaiser hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: "Hey folks, here's the deal. Today, you're processing about 100 x-rays per day. From now on, we're going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you've missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you're only processing 98 x-rays per day. That's fine, we just care about finding all those tumors." If that's what they said, I'd be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market's bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: "Look, you fire 9/10s of your radiologists, saving $20m/year, you give us $10m/year, and you net $10m/year, and the remaining radiologists' job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed, and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it's catastrophically wrong. "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist's fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis." This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes. This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble. If you're someone who's worried about cancer, and you're being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we're going to have to re-home America's 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say, "Well, OK, I'm sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I'm on." AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs' labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers. Now, some people will be on the workers' side because of politics or aesthetics. They just like workers better than their bosses. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you. Will those products be substandard? There's every reason to think so. Earlier, I alluded to "automation blindness, "the physical impossibility of remaining vigilant for things that rarely occur. This is why TSA agents are incredibly good at spotting water bottles. Because they get a ton of practice at this, all day, every day. And why they fail to spot the guns and bombs that government red teams smuggle through checkpoints to see how well they work, because they just don't have any practice at that. Because, to a first approximation, no one deliberately brings a gun or a bomb through a TSA checkpoint. Automation blindness is the Achilles' heel of "humans in the loop." Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI, and almost without exception, they are senior, experienced coders, who get to decide how they will use these tools. For example, you might ask the AI to generate a set of CSS files to faithfully render a web-page across multiple versions of multiple browsers. This is a notoriously fiddly thing to do, and it's pretty easy to verify if the code works – just eyeball it in a bunch of browsers. Or maybe the coder has a single data file they need to import and they don't want to write a whole utility to convert it. Tasks like these can genuinely make coders more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it's clear they're not looking to make some centaurs. They want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AIs' code. And because AI is just a word guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are literally statistically indistinguishable from working code (except that they're bugs). Here's an example: code libraries are standard utilities that programmers can incorporate into their apps, so they don't have to do a bunch of repetitive programming. Like, if you want to process some text, you'll use a standard library. If it's an HTML file, that library might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it's a DOCX file, it'll be lib.docx.text.parsing. But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there's another library, this one for parsing PDFs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it's called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Now, because the AI is a statistical inference engine, because all it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past, it will "hallucinate" a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into your program, and it will do things like steal user data or try and penetrate other computers on the same network. And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard to find error, this bug that is literally statistically indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they've been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire. But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don't think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company's top management. The kind of coder who'd lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google ten billion dollars in 2018. For AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the experienced workers, with process knowledge, and hard-won intuition, who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors. Like I said, the point here is to replace high-waged workers. And one of the reasons the AI companies are so anxious to fire coders is that coders are the princes of labor. They're the most consistently privileged, sought-after, and well-compensated workers in the labor force. If you can replace coders with AI, who cant you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI. Which brings me to AI art. AI art – or "art" – is also an ad for AI, but it's not part of AI's business model. Let me explain: on average, illustrators don't make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precartized groups of workers out there. They suffer from a pathology called "vocational awe." That's a term coined by the librarian Fobazi Ettarh, and it refers to workers who are vulnerable to workplace exploitation because they actually care about their jobs – nurses, librarians, teachers, and artists. If AI image generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of Open AI's campuses. The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death-knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It's to create buzz. Which is not to say that it's not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that "some creative jobs shouldn't have been there in the first place," and that it's not especially disgusting that she and her colleagues boast about using the work of artists to ruin those artists' livelihoods. It's supposed to be disgusting. It's supposed to get artists to run around and say, "The AI can do my job, and it's going to steal my job, and isn't that terrible?" Because the customers for AI – corporate bosses – don't see AI taking workers' jobs as terrible. They see it as wonderful. But can AI do an illustrator's job? Or any artist's job? Let's think about that for a second. I've been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story, and I've given it a lot of thought, and here's what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, or a poem, or a painting, or a drawing, or a dance, or a book, or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind. Now that I've defined art, we have to go on a little detour. I have a friend who's a law professor, and before the rise of chatbots, law students knew better than to ask for reference letters from their profs, unless they were a really good student. Because those letters were a pain in the ass to write. So if you advertised for a postdoc and you heard from a candidate with a reference letter from a respected prof, the mere existence of that letter told you that the prof really thought highly of that student. But then we got chatbots, and everyone knows that you generate a reference letter by feeding three bullet points to an LLM, and it'll barf up five paragraphs of florid nonsense about the student. So when my friend advertises for a postdoc, they are flooded with reference letters, and they deal with this flood by feeding all these letters to another chatbot, and ask it to reduce them back to three bullet points. Now, obviously, they won't be the same bullet-points, which makes this whole thing terrible. But just as obviously, nothing in that five-paragraph letter except the original three bullet points are relevant to the student. The chatbot doesn't know the student. It doesn't know anything about them. It cannot add a single true or useful statement about the student to the letter. What does this have to do with AI art? Art is a transfer of a big, numinous, irreducible feeling from an artist to someone else. But the image-gen program doesn't know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero. It's possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or The Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, or interesting, or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human. And in the meantime, it's bad art. It's bad art in the sense of being "eerie," the word Mark Fisher uses to describe "when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something." AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it's missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it's undetectable. The images were striking before we figured out the trick, but now they're just like the images we imagine in clouds or piles of leaves. We're the ones drawing a frame around part of the scene, we're the ones focusing on some contours and ignoring the others. We're looking at an inkblot, and it's not telling us anything. Sometimes that can be visually arresting, and to the extent that it amuses people in a community of prompters and viewers, that's harmless. I know someone who plays a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game over Zoom. It's transcribed by an open source model running locally on the dungeon master's computer, which summarizes the night's session and prompts an image generator to create illustrations of key moments. These summaries and images are hilarious because they're full of errors. It's a bit of harmless fun, and it bring a small amount of additional pleasure to a small group of people. No one is going to fire an illustrator because D&D players are image-genning funny illustrations where seven-fingered paladins wrestle with orcs that have an extra hand. But bosses have and will fire illustrators, because they fantasize about being able to dispense with creative professionals and just prompt an AI. Because even though the AI can't do the illustrator's job, an AI salesman can convince the illustrator's boss to fire them and replace them with an AI that can't do their job. This is a disgusting and terrible juncture, and we should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism's fatalism: "There is no alternative." So what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model. And I'm here to tell you they are wrong: wrong because this would inflict terrible collateral damage on socially beneficial activities, and it would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason!. Let's break down the steps in AI training. First, you scrape a bunch of web-pages. This is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. You do not need a license to make a transient copy of a copyrighted work in order to analyze it, otherwise search engines would be illegal. Ban scraping and Google will be the last search engine we ever get, the Internet Archive will go out of business, that guy in Austria who scraped all the grocery store sites and proved that the big chains were colluding to rig prices would be in deep trouble. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for. It's just not illegal to count the elements of a copyrighted work. And we really don't want it to be, not if you're interested in scholarship of any kind. And it's important to note that counting things is legal, even if you're working from an illegally obtained copy. Like, if you go to the flea market, and you buy a bootleg music CD, and you take it home and you make a list of all the adverbs in the lyrics, and you publish that list, you are not infringing copyright by doing so. Perhaps you've infringed copyright by getting the pirated CD, but not by counting the lyrics. This is why Anthropic offered a $1.5b settlement for training its models based on a ton of books it downloaded from a pirate site: not because counting the words in the books infringes anyone's rights, but because they were worried that they were going to get hit with $150k/book statutory damages for downloading the files. OK, after you count all the pixels or the words, it's time for the final step: publishing them. Because that's what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array. And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which truthful, factual statements you can publish. But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I'm full of shit. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first time someone thought that. After all, even if I'm right about how copyright works now, there's no reason we couldn't change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there's even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don't like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing. Well, even then, you're not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. If you're thinking that you can, you need to grapple with this fact: we have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer. And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also: the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than its ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators' bosses at the media company. So how it is that we have given all these new rights to creators, and those new rights have generated untold billions, and left creators poorer? It's because in a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming "think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!" Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what's good for you. The day Disney and Universal filed suit against Midjourney, I got a press release from the RIAA, which represents Disney and Universal through their recording arms. Universal is the largest label in the world. Together with Sony and Warner, they control 70% of all music recordings in copyright today. It starts: "There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry." It ends: "This action by Disney and Universal represents a critical stand for human creativity and responsible innovation." And it's signed by Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA. It's very likely that name doesn't mean anything to you. But let me tell you who Mitch Glazier is. Today, Mitch Glazier is the CEO if the RIAA, with an annual salary of $1.3m. But until 1999, Mitch Glazier was a key Congressional staffer, and in 1999, Glazier snuck an amendment into an unrelated bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, that killed musicians' right to take their recordings back from their labels. This is a practice that had been especially important to "heritage acts" (which is a record industry euphemism for "old music recorded by Black people"), for whom this right represented the difference between making rent and ending up on the street. When it became clear that Glazier had pulled this musician-impoverishing scam, there was so much public outcry, that Congress actually came back for a special session, just to vote again to cancel Glazier's amendment. And then Glazier was kicked out of his cushy Congressional job, whereupon the RIAA started paying more than $1m/year to "represent the music industry." This is the guy who signed that press release in my inbox. And his message was: The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to train a Gen AI model on copyrighted works, and then use that model to put artists on the breadline. The problem is that Midjourney didn't pay RIAA members Universal and Disney for permission to train a model. Because if only Midjourney had given Disney and Universal several million dollars for training rights to their catalogs, the companies would have happily allowed them to train to their heart's content, and they would have bought the resulting models, and fired as many creative professionals as they could. I mean, have we already forgotten the Hollywood strikes? I sure haven't. I live in Burbank, home to Disney, Universal and Warner, and I was out on the line with my comrades from the Writers Guild, offering solidarity on behalf of my union, IATSE 830, The Animation Guild, where I'm a member of the writers' unit. And I'll never forget when one writer turned to me and said, "You know, you prompt an LLM exactly the same way an exec gives shitty notes to a writers' room. You know: 'Make me ET, except it's about a dog, and put a love interest in there, and a car chase in the second act.' The difference is, you say that to a writers' room and they all make fun of you and call you a fucking idiot suit. But you say it to an LLM and it will cheerfully shit out a terrible script that conforms exactly to that spec (you know, Air Bud)." These companies are desperate to use AI to displace workers. When Getty Images sues AI companies, it's not representing the interests of photographers. Getty hates paying photographers! Getty just wants to get paid for the training run, and they want the resulting AI model to have guardrails, so it will refuse to create images that compete with Getty's images for anyone except Getty. But Getty will absolutely use its models to bankrupt as many photographers as it possibly can. A new copyright to train models won't get us a world where models aren't used to destroy artists, it'll just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss, a human shield they can brandish in policy fights, a tissue-thin pretense of "won't someone think of the hungry artists?" When really what they're demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders' pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal? We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment. And incredibly enough, there's a really simple way to do that. After 20+ years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists' rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That's why the "monkey selfie" is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium. And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they've defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle. The fact that every AI created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them, or give them away for free. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission. The US Copyright Office's position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you're a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that's no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you're a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd-scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted. But creative workers don't have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers' strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in "sectoral bargaining," whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector. That's been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright. Our allies in a campaign to expand copyright are our bosses, who have never had our best interests at heart. While our allies in the fight for sector bargaining are every worker in the country. As the song goes, "Which side are you on?" OK, I need to bring this talk in for a landing now, because I'm out of time, so I'm going to close out with this: AI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible. Bubbles transfer the life's savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it. But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It's still in the ground. At my home, I've got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber. All things being equal, it would have been better if Worldcom hadn't ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage. I don't think we'll salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. Sure, there'll be a few coders who've learned something about secure programming in Rust. But when crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey JPEGs. AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the data-centers will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind? We'll have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We'll have a lot of cheap GPUs, which'll be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who'll be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we'll have the open source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video, describing images, summarizing documents, automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing, like removing backgrounds, or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamt of. If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps for back-propagation, machine learning and generative adversarial networks, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We'd call them "plugins." It's the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn't want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, "disruptive" things: Big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year. When the AI investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won't be economical to keep the data-centers running. As Stein's Law has it: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100b IOU. Bosses are mass-firing productive workers and replacing them with janky AI, and when the janky AI is gone, no one will be able to find and re-hire most of those workers, we're going to go from disfunctional AI systems to nothing. AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more. So we need to get rid of this bubble. Pop it, as quickly as we can. To do that, we have to focus on the material factors driving the bubble. The bubble isn't being driven by deepfake porn, or election disinformation, or AI image-gen, or slop advertising. All that stuff is terrible and harmful, but it's not driving investment. The total dollar figure represented by these apps doesn't come close to making a dent in the capital expenditures and operating costs of AI. They are peripheral, residual uses: flashy, but unimportant to the bubble. Get rid of all those uses and you reduce the expected income of AI companies by a sum so small it rounds to zero. Same goes for all that "AI Safety" nonsense, that purports to concern itself with preventing an AI from attaining sentience and turning us all into paperclips. First of all, this is facially absurd. Throwing more words and GPUs into the word-guessing program won't make it sentient. That's like saying, "Well, we keep breeding these horses to run faster and faster, so it's only a matter of time until one of our mares gives birth to a locomotive." A human mind is not a word-guessing program with a lot of extra words. I'm here for science fiction thought experiments, don't get me wrong. But also, don't mistake sf for prophesy. SF stories about superintelligence are futuristic parables, not business plans, roadmaps, or predictions. The AI Safety people say they are worried that AI is going to end the world, but AI bosses love these weirdos. Because on the one hand, if AI is powerful enough to destroy the world, think of how much money it can make! And on the other hand, no AI business plan has a line on its revenue projections spreadsheet labeled "Income from turning the human race into paperclips." So even if we ban AI companies from doing this, we won't cost them a dime in investment capital. To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side. Because the AI bubble really is very bad news, it's worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with high-tech asbestos.

Title: Millionaire YouTuber Hank Green tells Gen Z to rethink their Tesla bets—and shares the portfolio changes he’s making to avoid AI-bubble fallout

Full Content:
For years, YouTube star Hank Green has stuck to the same straightforward investing wisdom touted by legends like Warren Buffett: Put your money in an S&P 500 index fund and leave it alone. It’s advice that has paid off handsomely for millions of investors: This year alone, the index is up roughly some 16% and averaged more than 20% in gains over the past three years and roughly 14.6% over the past two decades. In most cases, it has easily beaten investors who try to pick individual stocks like Tesla or Meta. But as Wall Street frets over a possible AI-driven bubble—with voices from Big Short investor Michael Burry to economist Mohamed El-Erian sounding alarms—Green isn’t waiting around to see what happens. He’s already rethinking how much of his own wealth is tied to Big Tech. A major reason: The S&P 500 is more concentrated than ever. The top 10 companies—including Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta—make up nearly 40% of the entire index. And nearly all of them are pouring billions into AI. “I feel like my money is more exposed than I would like it to be,” Green said in a video that’s racked up over 1.6 million views. “I feel like by virtue of having a lot of my money in the S&P 500, I am now kind of betting on a big AI future. And that’s not a future that I definitely think is going to happen.” So Green is hedging. He’s taking 25% of the money he previously invested in S&P 500 index funds—a meaningful chunk for a self-made millionaire—and moving it into a more diversified set of assets, including: Green’s thesis is simple: Even if AI transforms the economy, the biggest winners may ultimately not be the mega-cap companies building the models. “I think that these giant companies providing the AI models will actually be competing with each other for those customers in part by competing on price,” Green said. “And that might mean that the value delivered to small companies will be bigger than value delivered to the big AI companies. Who knows, though? I just think that’s a thing that could happen.” And if his concerns are overblown? He’s fine with that, too. “If I’m wrong, 75% of my money is still in the safe place that everybody says your money should be, which is the S&P 500.” Gen Z continues to trail other generations in financial know-how—from saving and investing to understanding risk, according to TIAA. Moreover, one in four admit they are not confident in their financial knowledge and skill—a stark admission considering that one in seven Gen Z credit card users have maxed out their credit cards and many young people hold thousands in student loan debt. As a self-described “middle-aged, 45-year-old successful person,” Green said he’s trying to model what thoughtful, long-term decision-making actually looks like. And part of that effort includes dispelling one big misconception shared among some of his audience: “I get these comments from people who are like, I can’t believe that you’re participating in this Ponzi scheme,” Green told Fortune. “I do want to alienate those people, because I don’t believe that the stock market is a Ponzi scheme. I do think that it’s overvalued right now, but I think that it’s tied to real value that’s really created in the world.” His broader point: Investing isn’t about vibes or just dumping money into the hot stock of the week; rather, it’s something to seriously research. “A lot of people think that investing is like getting a Robinhood account and buying Tesla,” Green added. “And I’m like, ‘Nope, you’ve got to get a Fidelity account and buy a low-cost index fund everybody and or just keep it in your 401(k) and let the people who manage it manage it’—which is what a lot of people do, which is also fine.” His younger viewers are paying attention. One popular comment summed it up: “As a young person entering the point in my life where I’m starting to think about investing, I really appreciate you talking through your logic and giving a ton of disclaimers rather than telling me I should buy buy buy exactly what you buy buy buy.” The comment has already racked up more than 4,700 likes. While Green doesn’t come from a financial background, experts from the world of investing said they agree largely with his rationale: Having a diversified portfolio is the way to go—especially if you have worries about an AI bubble. “Unlike many dotcom companies, today’s tech giants generally have substantial revenue, cash reserves, and established business models beyond just AI,” certified financial planner Bo Hanson, host of The Money Guy Show, said in a video analyzing Green’s take. “Still, the concentration risk remains a valid concern for investors that are seeking diversification. However, this is precisely why we advise against putting all investments solely in the S&P 500, especially if you have a shorter time horizon.” Hanson added wise investors spread their money across various asset classes, including small-caps, international, and bonds, in order to reduce portfolio volatility and provide more consistent returns across various market environments. It’s sentiment echoed by Doug Ornstein, director at TIAA Wealth Management, who said it’s important to realize that not every investment needs to chase growth. “Particularly as you get older, having guaranteed income streams becomes crucial. Products like annuities can provide reliable payments regardless of market swings, creating a foundation of financial security,” Ornstein told Fortune. “Think of it as building a floor beneath your portfolio—one that market volatility can’t touch.”

By Rolling Stone If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are easy to shop for, and those who make the holiday season a little more challenging with their picky, well, let’s call it specific taste. With hundreds of websites to choose from, and the holidays fast approaching (most shipping deadlines are Dec. 17, 2025, to arrive in time for Christmas), how do you find unique gifts for the nice-list members who are a bit more particular? Our Rolling Stone editors have put together a guide featuring more than 60 of the best gifts to grab this holiday season. While most of these items are music-oriented — that’s what we do, after all — we’ve also included a few surprises that will make anyone feel merry and bright. From Grateful Dead collaborations to band merch that’s a lot more premium than digging through a bargain bin to the best in tech and tested audio equipment, these are our top-rated gifts for this holiday season. So go ahead, read, peek, and add to cart. It’s everything you didn’t know you were looking for, all in one place. From musician autobiographies to coffee-table books featuring your favorite bands, these are the best gifts for every reader. $22.17 $29.99 26% off Lawrence Burney’s debut, No Sense in Wishing: Essays, traces the author and cultural critic’s musical journey from his formative years in Baltimore to transformative experiences in Lagos and Johannesburg. Burney explores turning points like watching his mother perform as the opening act at a Gil Scott-Heron show, Lupe Fiasco introducing him to a kind of Blackness he initially thought was “corny as shit,“ and the New York fandom leading him to interrogate regional distinctions of Blackness. The collection of essays transcends the author’s personal self-searching to become a fresh ethno-musical study. $24.50 $35.00 30% off Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film, Almost Famous, was inspired by his early days as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Now, Crowe returns to that familiar territory, without the gloss of fiction. The Uncool is a memoir documenting a raucous time for rock & roll and a freewheeling moment in this publication’s history, when the merely 16-year-old Crowe profiled artists like Led Zeppelin and Jackson Browne. There’s no shortage of famous faces in The Uncool: David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, and Kris Kristofferson, to name a few. But there are some not-so-famous ones, too; Crowe dives deep on his family, offering a portrait of his parents and his Southern Californian upbringing. $50.37 $65.00 23% off Jill Furmanovsky’s Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere would have been the ideal tribute to what once was, if not for the unlikeliest of unlikely story lines — the brothers Gallagher reuniting for one of the most unforgettable tours in the history of rock & roll. Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere features hundreds of photos of the band in the studio, onstage, and everywhere in between. Furmanovsky has photographed Oasis since the Definitely Maybe days, making this one of the most intimate looks at a band that would immodestly — but not incorrectly — call themselves Familiar to Millions. $107.23 $150.00 29% off Anton Corbijn’s music-video credits play like a greatest hits of rock from the 1980s onward. From U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana and Metallica, Corbijn has been there, camera in tow. This retrospective compiles hundreds of photographs from Corbijn’s archives, including portraits of R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Nick Cave. The book also includes written contributions from Adam Clayton of U2, Marlene Dumas, Johan Faes, Samantha Morton, and Tom Waits. $55.00 From her live performances to her music videos, Mitski has an undeniable power of drawing audiences in. Photographer Ebru Yıldız distills that electric energy into King of All the Land, a 144-page art book featuring powerful black-and-white images of Mitski, shot around Nashville. Yıldız is known largely for her portraits of musicians, from John Cale and David Byrne to Lucy Dacus and Angel Olsen. King of All the Land documents the synergy of two artists — Yıldız and Mitski — and their singular, uncompromising visions. $71.96 $100.00 28% off This photography book from rock & roll photographer Elliott Landy comprises nearly 400 images of the Band during a formative year from 1968 to ’69. The group was creating their first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band, which birthed a new Americana sound. “I don’t believe there will ever be anything that even vaguely resembles that kind of musical unity again. Nor does there need to be. They said it all,” writes Eric Clapton, in the book’s foreword. $69.90 $75.00 7% off This definitive behind-the-scenes book delivers the full story of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Journalist and author Jay Glennie worked with Quentin Tarantino to unearth photographs from the set, concept art, production memos, and other artifacts from the film’s creation. The book also includes more than 65 exclusive interviews with cast and crew members, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It’s a peek at how the double Oscar-winner was created, and Tarantino’s movie-making process. $14.50 Sometimes it’s far more interesting to dive into an autobiography than a fantasy novel — no shade to our beloved fiction favorites. But this one about Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson is easily one of the most compelling reads to hit our list in years. At 178 pages, it’s a tight, intimate look at Gibson’s life and career. $12.81 $27.99 54% off Rob Sheffield — bestselling author, journalist, and longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor (since 1997, no big deal) — has written eight books on music, TV, and pop culture. His latest, Heartbreak Is the National Anthem, might be his most powerful yet.With an in-depth look into the life and legacy of Taylor Swift, he explores everything from the magical relationship she has with her fans and her songwriting prowess to her ability to captivate stadiums filled with 90,000 people. It’s a “Timeless” masterpiece that you’ll want to read over and over again. $11.99 Music journalist Jeff Weiss spent the first years of his career in Los Angeles working for celebrity tabloids at a time when the medium was at its peak. In the early 2000s, before blogs and social media pushed the industry off its track, Weiss carved out a niche as a young and hungry writer willing to concoct elaborate fake personas in order to chase down the day’s biggest story. Of course, the most prominent pop star of the time, Britney Spears, was always in his crosshairs. This book, which documents his time in the ethically murky industry, not only charts her rise from a bubbly Louisiana teen to her entry into a conservatorship but also wrestles with his own complicity in her downfall. While it’s not entirely nonfiction — Weiss has admitted that some of the scenes were created with literary license, though he’s declined to say exactly which ones — it’s a frenetic and engrossing read, perfect for anyone interested in Spears’ career or tabloid media’s race to the bottom. The most impressive part of the book is the care with which he comes at the subject. “I tried to make it a sympathetic portrayal of Britney,” Weiss told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I didn’t want to be condescending to her.” $25.06 $29.00 14% off We know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but trust us, this paperback by Mark Ronson reads just as good as it looks. On sale for the holidays, it’s an authentic and compelling account from the man behind some of today’s most influential tracks. $33.17 $50.00 34% off Photography legend Jim Marshall’s book, The Grateful Dead: Photos and Stories From the Formative Years, 1966-1977, is the first-ever collection dedicated solely to his work with the Grateful Dead. This book features some of the most revealing and previously unseen images of the band, most of which were captured in San Francisco. It also includes notable musicians like Janis Joplin, Neil Young, David Crosby, and others. Additionally, the book includes an afterward by John Mayer, the frontman and guitarist of Dead & Company. It features colored edges, making it a perfect gift for fans of the psychedelic scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Whether they’re a fan from afar or proudly “with the band,” these gifts — from home decor to limited-edition games and instruments — are must-haves for any music devotee. $45.00 Noah Kahan’s beloved album Stick Season may have dropped in 2022, but our staff still has it on repeat (just peek at a few of our Spotify Wrapped receipts). If there’s a Kahan fan in your life, or honestly just someone who lives in New England, grab this Stick Season candle by Ranger Station. It smells like a chilly day in Maine, but without the frostbite. The brand notes it has a long burn time too, of up to 30 hours. $36.98 $75.00 51% off Barbie has released plenty of diva dolls over the years — there was the recent Stevie Nicks launch, the Aaliyah Barbie that sold out in seconds, and now a drop dedicated to the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey. Decked out in her sparkly red dress, this rare doll is already almost sold out on Amazon. So if you’re waiting for the right “tiiiiiime!” to add it to your cart for the collector in your life, this is it. $21.25 $25.00 15% off Shopping for musicians can be trickier than it seems — most are extremely particular about their gear (understandably so; not every axe is created equal). That’s why we suggest something like this leather guitar-pick holder. It’s way less pressure than choosing a new guitar for them, but just as useful — and it still feels thoughtful. Plus, Etsy notes that you can engrave the case, making them feel like the rock star they already are. $1,210.00 Ah, sometimes we miss the nostalgic days of the boombox era … OK, we’re mostly kidding, because playing music on your phone is definitely more convenient. But that longing for the good-old days pops up now and then. That’s why we love this necklace from editor-favorite brand Sydney Evan. It’s cheeky yet chic and makes a great gift for yourself or the fellow Nineties wild child in your life. $79.96 Good golly, Miss Dolly! The country superstar has done it again: this time with wines that taste far more premium than their affordable price tag. Available on the Home Shopping Network in various multi-packs, these Dolly Parton-branded wines come in adorable packaging with an even punchier taste. They’re the perfect gift for any holiday soiree or secret Santa exchange. $16.30 If you want presents as unique as the person receiving them, Uncommon Goods is our go-to. These music-themed playing cards feature legends like Amy Winehouse, David Bowie, and Prince, making them an ace when it comes to gifting. Grab a deck for as low as $16. $39.99 Surprise your favorite Metallica fan with the very same stainless-steel tumbler used by James Ulrich onstage. He even has a specially designed microphone stand with a bottle holder for his Yeti when he’s performing live. This 20-ounce cup keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot — whether you’re singing onstage or having a casual karaoke sesh by the fire this holiday season. $329.00 $388.00 15% off If you want to win the award for giving your favorite musician the coolest gift they’ve ever received (or seen, for that matter), this sampler is it. For less than $330, it’s “packed with over 400 handcrafted instruments and sounds from iconic reggae producers, plus a synth engine with classic bass and lead tones and pressure-sensitive dub sirens,” according to the brand. $1,149.00 This gorgeous, compact, and incredibly playable instrument will instantly become anyone’s couch guitar of choice, and it’s also set up with the electronics you need to play out. As the brand-new junior model of Jeff Tweedy’s just-reissued signature 00DB — which aimed to emulate Woody Guthrie’s guitars of choice — it’s also shockingly affordable for a Martin signature guitar, with a tight, punchy sound. It’s made of sustainable wood too. Only one warning: If you buy this thing and fail to instantly write “Handshake Drugs”-level masterpieces on it, that’s on you. $50.00 Valhalla digital plugins are the behind-the-scenes secret sauce on everything from pop smashes to single-stream hopefuls. Always affordable, simple to use, and beautifully designed, their newest drop, FutureVerb’s clean spaces pair easily with highly colored echoes, easily transforming generic ho-hum sounds into towering epic studio ’scapes. $24.95 “Roll dice and leave your bummers behind,” advertises Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey, a new game from Twogether Studios. This game does all that and more, as you roll extremely groovy dice (they’re tie-dye, obviously), and take trips around the iconic frontman’s artwork while accumulating tokens. The packaging also includes a “cosmic journey bag” that you can use for the game pieces or … other items. “My dad’s legacy lives on through moments of joy, laughter, and connection,” Trixie Garcia said in a statement. “Like music, games foster community, and Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey is a whimsical way for fans to keep that spirit alive wherever the road may lead.” Amen to that. $17.98 The Twice trio recorded their own version of Huntr/x’s original diss track “Takedown” for this film’s soundtrack, and the group’s own song “Strategy” is also included in the film and on the album. Even if you’ve just had the Saja Boys’ infectious “Soda Pop” stuck in your head for weeks (we don’t blame you, us too), then you’ll want to order it now before it sells out ahead of the holidays. The CD comes with a fold-out poster and photo card (random one of three), like a real K-pop album. $215.00 Shopping for a Wilco fan? All you need is this box set and tickets to one of their upcoming shows, and you can check them off your list twice in one go. $99.00 Backpack-sized and ready to fit into every producer’s setup, this is going to become a must, especially for laptop warriors. With real people-size controls, a screen so you can see what all the many, many knobs are actually doing, and a way to hit stop when your jam gets out of control, Akai’s new midi controller finally gets this small form factor right. $170.18 Few things are as striking as this White Stripes vinyl set — and, yes, that even includes decorations bought at Tiffany’s. Grab it now while it’s still in stock at Walmart for under $200, so they can spend the rest of the holidays jamming out to classics like “Black Math” and “Seven Nation Army.” $349.99 A turntable is always a great gift — whether they live and breathe vinyl or just want to give their living space a retro upgrade. $26.14 $32.99 21% off Bummed the five-foot-tall superstar’s Short n’ Sweet tour is over? Continue the sleepover party with these two dazzling records: The recent Grammy-nominated Man’s Best Friend and her 2023 Christmas EP, Fruitcake. The former is available in several spectacular vinyl variants, from iridescent blue to light brown, as well as several alternate covers that are worth getting your hands on. Fruitcake, one of the strongest Christmas albums from a pop star in years, is jam-packed (no pun intended) with Carpenter’s signature melodies and innuendos, only holiday themed (“I need that Charles Dickens,” she sings on “A Nonsense Christmas”). The milky, clear, and liquid glitter vinyl sold out instantly, but plenty of other colors are available. Put that on with Carpenter’s 2024 Christmas special in the background, and you’ll have a ho-ho holiday. $23.99 A gift that transcends generations, this limited-edition Buckingham Nicks baby-blue vinyl is a present worth fighting over. Perfect for your cousin who just discovered Fleetwood Mac on TikTok — or your grandmother who hasn’t stopped playing it since the Seventies. It’s a Yankee Swap winner. $20.99 Wondering what to do with your stack of cassettes after your 2006 Honda finally bit the dust? For those of us still committed to portable physical media — without the CD skips — Amazon has a perfect solution. This portable cassette player lets you revisit your collection using your favorite wired or wireless headphones. The best part is its ability to record, too, meaning endless possibilities to impress that special someone with a good old-fashioned mix tape. $39.99 For the aspiring studio rat in your life, give them a break and get them what they won’t get themselves. A way to figure out what’s wrong when there’s no sound happening. This affordable Swiss army knife of a cable tester will help them figure out that they need to take better care of their connections. From the best Bluetooth speakers to over-ear cans that block out the world, these tech-forward gifts are everything they’ve been wanting this season. $129.00 $149.00 13% off With a stylish transparent case and plenty of smart features, Nothing’s earbuds are a standout, and the sound quality outperforms a lot of the competition at this price. Replace your giftee’s old, tired buds this season with a fresh new pair (for 13 percent off). $179.99 From its long-lasting battery life (30-plus hours on a charge) to its packable frame, the Marshall Emberton speaker checks all of our boxes for a great, reliable outdoor speaker. We’ve used ours to play music outside for months (and left it there, accidentally), because that’s what it’s designed to do. It can handle rain, serious dust, and hours of tunes. Bonus: The retro design instantly makes any patio look cooler. $59.95 Over the past couple of years, Loop has established itself as the leader in universal-fit earplugs. Most of our staff (myself included) have extensively tested the brand’s bestsellers and can confidently say the hype is real. I love their metallic, jewelry-like design, which makes them better-looking than most earplugs (unless you want total discretion). More importantly, I love the excellent noise-reduction that turns down the volume without sacrificing audio quality.The Loop Switch 2 is our top pick from the brand. Unlike most earplugs, you can adjust how much volume is let in by shifting a dial (no need to swap tips). The plugs have three modes: “Quiet,” “Experience,” and “Engage,” ranging from almost full quiet to noise-dampening. The former is great for non-concert activities, as well as extremely loud shows, while the “Engage” option is ideal for full immersion and occasional conversations. $499.99 $599.99 17% off Polaroid’s flagship camera will take your instant photos to the next level. With tack-sharp autofocus and fully-manual controls built into the camera (and even more available via an App), you can take full command behind the lens. The I-2 lens contains the largest aperture of any Polaroid camera to date, allowing for beautiful portraits and lower-light shooting that was never possible before. $649.00 $849.95 24% off The X Half combines analog ideas in a digital format. At its simplest, the camera is fun-sized, vertically-oriented, and loaded up with Fuji’s signature-film presets based on the brand’s own classic film stocks. To really turn up the old-school experience, there is a “film camera mode” that prevents image previews, which requires the user to use a film advance lever to enable the next frame. In standard mode, that same lever can also be used to enable split-frame photography, much like the original half-frame cameras that it is based on. $449.99 $549.00 18% off I first tried these headphones last summer, when a manager played me a song on them. I was stunned by the sound quality and immediately asked what brand they were. There’s a lot to love with the AirPods Max: The sound is expansive and truly noise-cancelling; they instantly connect to all of my devices; and they have a long battery life. Plus, they’re available in flattering colors and actually fit my tiny head, unlike previous headphones. They sit snug and comfortably in place, whether I’m sitting at my desk, walking around New York City, or even running on the treadmill. It’s a steep price, but totally worth it when I think about how much use I’m getting out of them and how perfect a gift they’d make. $699.99 You know a gift is truly great when it’s sold out almost everywhere — who doesn’t remember the Cabbage Patch craze of the Eighties? Luckily, we tracked down the Marshall Heston 60 soundbar, still available at Best Buy in limited quantities. While it comes with a $699 price tag, it’ll amp up movie night for any cinephile in your life. $89.00 $99.00 10% off Finding a great gift can already feel like a win, but scoring one on sale makes the season even merrier and brighter. Take this wireless audio streamer, for instance: Available on Amazon with delivery in less than two days via Prime, it’s a fun little gadget that fits neatly on a desk or bedside table. $1,199.99 $1,499.99 20% off Our staff tested dozens of speakers this year, and Klipsch’s the Sevens were the best in terms of sound, price, and design. The midcentury-inspired bookshelf speakers deliver a beautiful sound stage and a warm, full experience — no matter what kind of music you’re playing. They don’t require an amp, making them a great gift for audiophiles and newbies alike. $399.99 $449.00 11% off Bose’s latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones, released in October, combine the all-day comfort and industry-leading noise canceling Bose is known for with subtle, but genuinely useful upgrades over the original 2023 model. The latest generation of the headphones features a similar design to the first generation, but with polished metal yokes instead of matte. While I personally preferred the understated matte accents, the QC Ultra 2 headphones nonetheless have a stylish, high-end look. They’re lightweight, but the headband and ear cups have ample, comfortable cushioning. Overall, when it comes to performance and features, noise-canceling and audio quality, and comfort and design, the QC Ultra 2 headphones are as close to the complete package as anything on the market. While we love digging through concert merch bins and scouring our favorite thrift shops for the coolest band gear, these clothing picks are just as awesome — with half the effort. $68.00 Imogene + Willie offers some of the softest 100-percent cotton graphic tees, as well as adorable caps and beanies. Originally a denim company, Imogene + Willie has evolved into a full retail shop with brick-and-mortar locations in Austin and Nashville. Their designs are heavily influenced by music, and they collaborate with artists like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Billy Strings, as well as iconic venues like the Grand Ole Opry. Their clothing is both stylish and cozy, creating a perfect concert outfit. We test a lot of clothing at Rolling Stone, but there’s one brand we keep coming back to: Dr. Martens. The iconic footwear company just dropped these new stud-covered shoes, and we’re already chomping at the bit to wear them to our next rock concert. Sure, they’d make an epic gift for anyone on your nice list, but honestly? They’re the kind of steal you should snap up for yourself while they’re still in stock. $250.00+ There’s no shortage of merch for Deadheads, from dog bowls to toothbrush holders. And don’t even get us started on apparel. The Dead have done collaborations with everyone from Old Navy to designer Gabriela Hearst. So, where does one get the best Steal Your Face sweater? Look no further than Alice + Olivia, who just released their new collab with the Dead (their second since 2016) in honor of the iconic band’s 60th anniversary. It’s difficult not to be overwhelmed by the amount of stellar items they have, but I recommend the skull pullover and muscle tank, which are great quality and fit perfectly. However, any of the items make a great gift for the Deadhead in your life — they’re sure to be merry and grateful. $125.00 You know what they say: The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time — especially when it’s covered in embroidered emblems. Available in sizes from small to 2XL, there are “No Surprises” with this Radiohead jumper: It’s high-quality, has a premium design, and will make your giftee look like the opposite of a “Creep.” $17.40 Socks can be a controversial gift, does Dad really need another pair of crisp, white calf coverings? But this black-and-white pair, made in collaboration with American band Blue Angel, is a massive upgrade from the basic gift. $110.00 Sometimes it’s worth taking style tips from some of our favorite celebrities, like Matthew McConaughey and Brooke Shields, and this time, they were definitely right about Caddis glasses. The eyewear brand, which has been crafting some of Hollywood’s favorite reading and prescription frames since 2017, is a viral sensation — and one that actually lives up to the hype. With multiple styles to choose from, Caddis glasses keep anyone on trend, whether it’s just for fun (sunglasses) or for necessity (progressive readers). $110.00+ The perfect gift for any jam-band fan is a vintage T-shirt from Jesse Lockwood’s Primarily Dead shop. While the shop (which has been operating since 2020) features primarily Dead items (as its name suggests), it also offers T-shirts, stickers, and more from bands like Phish, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and other classic-rock and jam bands. Lockwood is very selective about what he sells, offering an array of choices, telling Rolling Stone, “Every one of these shirts has a story to tell — some were made and sold by fans in small batches in parking lots just to generate enough money to get to the next show, some are licensed single-show shirts made by the band and only sold at that venue, and others were more widely available. They all create a nostalgic feeling for both the people that were there and the people that wish they could have been there.” Lockwood also sources shirts. If you are looking for something specific, contact him on Instagram @primarily_dead or through his website, https://www.primarilydead.com/. $76.00 They don’t have to be a star on the court to love this Tennis Brat crew-neck sweater. This social media sensation works for every It-girl (or It-boy) on your shopping list thanks to the brand’s premium fabrics, easy fit, and unmistakable logo. $224.25 $299.00 25% off It’s no secret that the little black bricks in our pockets can be a major attention hog, but paradoxically, there are some situations where integrating tech in more places makes it less obtrusive. Take Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, which let you record photos, video, and more, all while keeping your phone securely stashed. First released in 2023, Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses have outlasted other smart glasses for one simple, undeniable reason — they don’t look ridiculous. Instead, Meta smartly leveraged the recognizable style of the world’s most iconic eyewear brand, landing on a design that’s barely more conspicuous than regular Wayfarers. If you want an all-encompassing gift — from gaming gear to experiential presents — these finds are perfect for a variety of ages and interests. $59.99 If there’s just one game you need to play from 2025, it’s Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG draws inspiration from Japanese titans of the genre like Final Fantasy, with a dynamic combat system that blends turn-based strategy and rhythmic parrying. And while the action is engaging, it’s the heartbreaking narrative and world-building that’s made the year’s most talked-about game a sensation. Set in a fantasy realm where a divine entity known as the Paintress eradicates everyone over a certain age year after year, players take on the roles of the latest band of would-be saviors on a suicide mission to bring humanity back from the brink. With award-worthy voice work from actors like Charlie Cox, Jennifer Hale, and Andy Serkis, the story presented in-game is a genuine tearjerker, and should be experienced by the widest possible audience, even if RPGs aren’t normally your bag. $498.88 A new generation of Nintendo hardware is always an event, but there’s some special alchemy that’s put Switch 2 on another level. The hybrid handheld/home console has quickly become the fastest selling console of all time, largely in part because of its, frankly, insane lineup of new games and the ability to play legacy Switch titles.The console’s library includes all-new releases like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and Metroid Prime 4 — many of which are among the best games of the year — on top of upgraded versions of classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With great ports of high-end games like Cyberpunk 2077 and indies like Hades II, Switch 2 is one of the most diverse platforms available, with something for every kind of player. $399.99 A good pair of gaming headphones is essential these days, as cinematic experiences and high-stakes online competition demand the best possible soundscape. And while it’s one thing to hear well, Razer Kraken V4 Pro cans provide a visceral physical response to in-game action with HD haptics. What does that mean? It’s essentially the tactile feedback (a.k.a. vibrations) that are now standard in all game controllers but applied to the headset.On PC, Kraken V4 Pro headphones can be paired with other Razer devices via Synapse to create a unique user profile — with certain titles like Borderlands 4 having been custom-tuned to provide haptic feedback and THX spatial audio tailored to the game. But using the OLED control hub, it can connect to basically anything (Switch, PS5, even mobile devices) via BlueTooth, USB, or auxiliary cable. It’s like having a rumbling IMAX theater wrapped around your head. $25.00+ Some people prefer to gift experiences rather than tangible items, and we’re 100 percent on board. A StubHub gift card lets them choose an event near them — whether it’s a concert, comedy show, or dance performance. There’s something for every type of fan. $6.00+ MasterClass is one of the internet’s favorite ways to learn a new skill, with courses on everything from music to acting to cooking. The best part? Every course is taught by an expert in the field, and many are also A-list celebrities. Gift it this holiday season for as low as $6. $65.00 Longtime cannabis activist Jane West got her start making accessories way back in 2016, right around the time weed was legalized in her home state of Colorado. She’d been working to promote women within the male-dominated industry, and her product line was similarly focused. We’ve been fans for the past decade, partaking in her ever-growing line of pipes, one-hitters, bongs, and bubblers, sometimes disguised as makeup compacts for discreet use. But her newest endeavor, the Twenties Collection, is by far our favorite. Inspired by Art Deco designs, these cut-glass objects are as beautiful as they are functional, and this hand pipe has become our favorite smoking object in our extensive arsenal. $90.00 There’s an unspoken competition about who looks best on the slopes, and these Grateful Dead and Knockaround snow goggles will help your favorite snowboarder or skier claim the title. Grab them at Dick’s Sporting Goods for under $100. $199.25 Building Lego’s 1,074-piece Fender Stratocaster set feels almost as gratifying as performing a solo on the guitar used by legends from Jimi Hendrix to Kurt Cobain. Everything here feels true to life, albeit miniaturized, including the Lego brick-based guitar’s pickup switch, tuning pegs, textile strap, stand, and picks (you have a choice of four colors). The best part? The fact that the set comes with an opportunity to view the final piece’s interior details, like its motherboard, not to mention that you can create the guitar in either black or red. Ideal for both rock & roll aficionados and the Lego-obsessed, this is a holiday gift that will keep on giving. After all, your recipient can rebuild it an endless amount of times (and our editors recommend doing just that). $9.99 We may be biased, but a Rolling Stone subscription is about as good as it gets. Sign them up online now for $9.99 for print and digital access — the best value for any music lover.

Title: Sam Altman's Dirty DRAM Deal

Home Videos Podcasts Articles GPU Chart Merchandise Support Us! More... Written by Tom of Moore’s Law Is Dead Special Assistance by KarbinCry & kari-no-sugata Based on this Video: https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw At the beginning of November, I ordered a 32GB DDR5 kit for pairing with a Minisforum BD790i X3D motherboard, and three weeks later those very same sticks of DDR5 are now listed for a staggering $330– a 156% increase in price from less than a month ago! At this rate, it seems likely that by Christmas, that DDR5 kit alone could be worth more than the entire Zen 4 X3D platform I planned to pair it with! How could this happen, and more specifically – how could this happen THIS quickly? Well, buckle up! I am about to tell you the story of Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal, or: How the AI bubble, panic, and unpreparedness stole Christmas... But before I dive in, let me make it clear that my RAM kit’s 156% jump in price isn’t a fluke or some extreme example of what's going on right now. Nope, and in fact, I'd like to provide two more examples of how how impossible it is becoming to get ahold of RAM - these were provided by a couple of our sources within the industry: One source that works at a US Retailer, stated that a RAM Manufacturer called them in order to inquire if they might buy RAM from them to stock up for their other customers. This would be like Corsair asking a Best Buy if they had any RAM around. Another source that works at a Prebuilt PC company, was recently given an estimate for when they would receive RAM orders if they placed them now…and they were told December…of 2026! So what happened? Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events: OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone else. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers. Below, we’re going to walk through each of these factors — and then I’m going to warn you about which hardware categories will be hit the hardest, which products are already being cancelled, and what you should buy right now before the shelves turn into a repeat of 2021–2022...because this is doomed to turn into much more than just RAM scarcity... On October 1st OpenAI signed two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the worlds DRAM supply. Now, did OpenAI’s competition suspect some big RAM deals could be signed in late 2025? Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO! In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just mere hours before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were simultaneously signed – most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow up to 40% of global DRAM output – even on morning before it happened! Nobody saw this coming - this is clear in the lack of reporting about the deals before they were announced, and every MLID Source who works in DRAM manufacturing and distribution insist this took everyone in the industry by surprise. To be clear - the shock wasn’t that OpenAI made a big deal, no, it was that they made two massive deals this big, at the same time, with Samsung and SK Hynix simultaneously! In fact, according to our sources - both companies had no idea how big each other's deal was, nor how close to simultaneous they were. And this secrecy mattered. It mattered a lot. Had Samsung known SK Hynix was about to commit a similar chunk of supply — or vice-versa — the pricing and terms would have likely been different. It’s entirely conceivable they wouldn’t have both agreed to supply such a substantial part of global supply if they had known more...but at the end of the day - OpenAI did succeed in keeping the circles tight, locking down the NDAs, and leveraging the fact that these companies assumed the other wasn’t giving up this much wafer volume simultaneously…in order to make a surgical strike on the global RAM supply chain…and it's worked so far... Imagine you're running a hyper scaler, or maybe you’re a major OEM, or perhaps pretend that you are simply one of OpenAI’s chief competitors: On October 1st of 2025, you would have woken up to the news that OpenAI had just cornered the memory market more aggressively than any company in the last decade, and you hadn't heard even a murmur that this was coming beforehand! Well, you would probably make some follow-up calls to colleagues in the industry, and then also quickly hear rumors that it wasn't just you - also the two largest suppliers didn’t even see each other’s simultaneous cooperation with OpenAI coming either! You wouldn't go: “Well, that’s an interesting coincidence”, no, you would say: “WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT?” Again – it’s not the size of the deals that's solely the issue here, no, it’s also the unexpectedness and brazenness of them. On October 1st silicon valley executives and procurement managers panicked over concerns like these: What other deals don’t we know about? Is this just the first of many? None of our DRAM suppliers warned us ahead of time! We have to assume they also won't in the future, and that it’s possible all of global DRAM could be bought up without us getting a single warning! We know OpenAI’s competitors are already panic-buying! If we don’t move now, we might be locked out of the market until 2028! OpenAI’s competitors, OEMs, and cloud providers scrambled to secure whatever inventory remained out of self-defense, and self-defense in a world that was entirely defenseless due to the accelerant I’ll now explain in Part III... Normally, the DRAM market has buffers: warehouses of emergency stock, excess wafer starts, older DRAM manufacturing machinery being sold off to budget brands while the big brands upgrade their production lines…but not in 2025, in 2025 those would-be buffers were depleted for three separate reasons: Tariff Chaos. Companies had deliberately reduced how much DRAM they ordered for their safety stock over the summer of 2025 because tariffs were changing almost weekly. Every RAM purchase risked being made at the wrong moment – and so fewer purchases were made. Prices had been falling all summer. Because of the hesitancy to purchase as much safety stock as usual, RAM prices were also genuinely falling over time. And, obviously when memory is getting cheaper month over month, the last thing you’d feel is pressured to buy a commodity that could be cheaper the next month…so everyone waited. Secondary RAM Manufacturing Had Stalled. Budget brands normally buy older DRAM fabrication equipment from mega-producers like Samsung when Samsung upgrades their DRAM lines to the latest and greatest equipment. This allows the DRAM market to expand more than it would otherwise because it makes any upgrading of the fanciest production lines to still be additive change to the market. However, Korean memory firms have been terrified that reselling old equipment to China-adjacent OEMs might trigger U.S. retaliation…and so those machines have been sitting idle in warehouses since early spring. Yep, there was no cushion. OpenAI hit the market at the exact moment it was least prepared. And now time for the biggest twist of all, a twist that’s actually public information, and therefore should be getting discussed by far more people in this writer's opinion: OpenAI isn’t even bothering to buy finished memory modules! No, their deals are unprecedentedly only for raw wafers — uncut, unfinished, and not even allocated to a specific DRAM standard yet. It’s not even clear if they have decided yet on how or when they will finish them into RAM sticks or HBM! Right now it seems like these wafers will just be stockpiled in warehouses – like a kid who hides the toybox because they’re afraid nobody wants to play with them, and thus selfishly feels nobody but them should get the toys! And let’s just say it: Here is the uncomfortable truth Sam Altman is always loath to admit in interviews: OpenAI is worried about losing its lead. The last 18 months have seen competitors catching up fast — Anthropic, Meta, xAI, and specifically Google’s Gemini 3 has gotten a ton of praise just in the past week. Everyone’s chasing training capacity. Everyone needs memory. DRAM is the lifeblood of scaling inference and training throughput. Cutting supply to your rivals is not a conspiracy theory. It’s a business tactic as old as business itself. And so, when you consider how secretive OpenAI was about their deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, but additionally how unready they were to immediately utilize their warehouses of DRAM wafers – it sure seems like a primary goal of these deals was to deprive the market, and not just an attempt to protect OpenAI's own supply… Alright, now that we are done explaining the how, let’s get to the “now what?” – because even if the RAM shortage miraculously improves immediately behind the scenes – even if the AI Bubble instantly popped or 10 companies started tooling up for more DRAM capacity this second (and many are, to be fair), at a minimum the next six to nine months are already screwed. See above: DRAM manufactures are quoting 13-Month lead times for DDR5! This is not a temporary blip. This could be a once-in-a-generation shock. So what gets hit first? What gets hit hardest? Well, below is an E through S-Tier ranking of which products are "the most screwed": S-Tier (Already Screwed – Too Late to Buy) - RAM itself, obviously. RAM prices have “exploded”. The detonation is in the past. A-Tier (Almost Screwed – Don’t Wait to Buy!!!) SSDs. These tends to follow DRAM pricing with a lag. Small Prebuilt PC Companies. That lack large buffers of inventory. RADEON GPUs. AMD doesn’t bundle RAM in their BOM kits to AIBs the way Nvidia does. In fact, the RX 9070 GRE 16GB this channel leaked months ago is almost certainly cancelled according to our sources. XBOX. Microsoft didn’t plan. Prices may rise and/or supply may dwindle in 2026. B-Tier (Eventually Screwed – Don’t wait much longer to buy!) Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia maintains large memory inventories for its board partners, giving them a buffer. But high-capacity GPUs (like a hypothetical 24GB 5080 SUPER) are on ice for now because those stores were never sufficiently built up. In fact, Nvidia is quietly telling partners that their SUPER refresh “might” launch Q3 2026 – although most partners think it’s just a placeholder for when Nvidia expects new capacity to come online, and thus SUPER may never launch. C-Tier (Think about buying soon) Laptops and phones. These companies negotiate immense long-term contracts, so they’re not hit immediately. But once their stockpiles run dry, watch out! D-Tier (Consider buying soon, but there’s no rush) PlayStation. Sony planned better than almost anyone else. They bought aggressively during the summer price trough, which is why they can afford a Black Friday discount while everyone else is raising prices. E-Tier (Prices might actually drop) Anything without RAM. Specifically CPUs that do not come with coolers could see price drops over time since there could be a drop in demand for CPUs if nobody has the RAM to feed them in systems. ???-Tier —Steam Machine. Valve keeps things quiet, but the big unknown is whether they pre-bought RAM months ago before announcing their much-hyped Steam Machine. If they did already stockpile an ample supply of DDR5 - then Steam Machine should launch fine, but supply could dry up temporarily at some point while they wait for prices to drop. However, if they didn’t plan ahead - expect a high launch price and very little resupply…it might even need to be cancelled or there might need to be a variant offered without RAM included (BYO RAM Edition!). And that’s it! This last bit was the most important part of the article in this writer's opinion – an attempt at helping you avoid getting burned. Well, actually, there is one other important reason for this article’s existence I'll tack onto the end – a hope that other people start digging into what’s going on at OpenAI. I mean seriously – do we even have a single reliable audit of their financials to back up them outrageously spending this much money…for this? Heck, I’ve even heard from numerous sources that OpenAI is “buying up the manufacturing equipment as well” – and without mountains of concrete proof, and/or more input from additional sources on what that really means…I don’t feel I can touch that hot potato without getting burned…but I hope someone else will… Sources: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-accelerate-advancements-in-global-ai-infrastructure https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr5/ai-led-dram-supply-crunch-reportedly-has-morgan-stanley-downgrading-major-oems-skyrocketing-memory-prices-could-erode-server-and-pc-margins https://wccftech.com/dram-prices-have-risen-by-a-whopping-172-this-year-alone/ https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1991255966235419112 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WTMMnQ/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh64gx5m2b6000c30?history_days=730 https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-knocking-100-off-ps5-consoles-for-black-friday-2025 https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-sk-hynix-halt-old-equipment-sales-over-fears-us-backlash-ft-reports-2024-03-12/ https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/samsung-and-sk-hynix-the-worlds-biggest-makers-of-dram-and-flash-memory-chips-have-potentially-lost-the-right-to-buy-us-equipment-for-use-in-their-china-based-factories/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/12/news-samsung-reportedly-expands-1c-dram-capacity-for-hbm4-targeting-60k-wafers-monthly-in-2025/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/01/news-openai-ceo-reportedly-meets-foxconn-tsmc-heads-to-korea-to-explore-samsung-sk-hynix-ties/?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://www.economist.com/business/2025/11/19/cracks-are-appearing-in-openais-dominant-facade?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://tech4gamers.com/ram-prices-increased/ https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2025/11/12/companies-will-struggle-to-stay-on-top-of-tariff-chaos https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-aims-source-all-us-iphones-india-pivot-away-china-ft-reports-2025-04-25/ https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/india-us-tariffs-china-trump-foreign-policy.html https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2024 https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidia-q3-updates-ai-bubble-fears-spotlight-2025-11-19/ https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/10/01/seoul-altman-ai-deal-samsung-sk-chips-data-centers/9291759343811/#google_vignette https://www.micron.com/products/memory?srsltid=AfmBOopdnGb80CSI2TU-hbQ6Ei33c2PJ-3ESQuxMk1FZrPrJjUwk8DQI https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/radeon-rx-9070-gre-16gb-rumor ©2019 by Moore's Law Is Dead.

Title: Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details

Time Published: 2025-12-05T23:00:53Z

Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Title: Salesforce CEO Mulls Changing Name to AI-Flavored ‘Agentforce’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-ceo-mulls-changing-name-to-ai-flavored-agentforce-2000696360
Time Published: 2025-12-05T22:25:34Z
Full Content:
Reading time 2 minutes Despite the fact that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff talks about AI nonstop, regularly chimes in on the AI news of the day, and endlessly pushes his company’s AI platform, he seems worried that people just aren’t associating Salesforce with AI. Luckily, he has a solution in mind, according to a report from Business Insider: changing the company’s entire name to Agentforce to evoke the AI agents that he’d like the company to be known for. While the suggestion of changing the company’s name was apparently raised in jest, Benioff took it seriously and told the publication that a new corporate name might be in the works. “That would not shock me,” he reportedly said, with an apparent preference for the name Agentforceâcurrently the name used by a number of the company’s AI-related services, including Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service, and Agentforce 365 Platform. On one hand, Salesforce Agentforce Sales is pretty redundant, so there’s some logic in simplifying the naming convention. On the other hand, it’s hard not to get a whiff of the cryptocurrency goldrush era, where companies just started throwing the word “blockchain” into everything. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation, a name that doesn’t even make sense, and saw its stock immediately skyrocket by over 400%? It feels like we’re not that far off from a situation similar to that. Salesforce, of course, would not be the first tech company to go through a rebrand. Google famously became Alphabet, Jack Dorsey’s Square changed to Block, Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X, and Michael Saylor changed Microstrategy’s moniker to Strategy as it became a bitcoin holding company. Notably, at least two of those are changes most people simply don’t acknowledge. But perhaps the most appropriate parallel for this particular change is Facebook rebranding to Meta in the midst of an effort to pivot the company into a new era where it would become the platform of the metaverse, an immersive virtual reality world where just about anything you could imagine is possible, including having legs. The dream of that particular reality is largely dead now, with Meta reportedlyÂ that it’ll likely have layoffs within its Reality Labs division and will shift away from the virtual world to build more AI products. And yet, the name sticks. That might be a fate Benioff should consider: if you go so far all-in on a single bet that you surrender your name to it, you might just be stuck with a reminder of that decision even if it fails.

Title: CoinEx Research November 2025 Report: Painvember's Brutal Reality Check

Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:01:00Z
Full Content:
December 05, 2025 10:01 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research’s November 2025 Report: Painvember is a brutal reality check after Uptober’s euphoric highs. Profit-taking by long-term holders, sustained ETF outflows, and cascading liquidations drove the downturn, all against a risk-off macro backdrop. While the Fed’s late-month dovish pivot and progress on the Ukraine–Russia peace framework briefly improved liquidity expectations, sentiment deteriorated again due to China reaffirming its crypto ban, S&P Global downgrading USDT, and rising Japanese yields threatening a yen carry-trade unwind. Beyond Bitcoin, AI and prediction-market sectors saw heightened volatility but also meaningful innovation and on-chain activity, while stablecoin flows printed their weakest reading in nearly a year, a key inflection point that may determine whether crypto enters a short-term correction or a new multi-month bear cycle. From Euphoria to Exhaustion: The Toughest Month of 2025 Following a fresh new high in early October, where Bitcoin peaked around $126,000, the momentum of "Uptober" dissipated rapidly, giving way to intense selling pressure throughout November. The asset plunged to a low of $80,500 before closing the month at $90,300, marking a 28% drawdown from its all-time high. This correction was fueled by profit-taking from OG whales, significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, and a wave of cascading liquidations, all amplified by a broader risk-off sentiment in the macroeconomic environment. On the macro side, the Federal Reserve shifted toward a more dovish stance late in the month, with market-implied odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut on December 10 climbing to 85%. This development, alongside progress in Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, offered a glimmer of optimism for improved liquidity conditions in crypto markets. However, sentiment soured toward month-end amid several headwinds: China reaffirmed its stringent crypto ban, S&P Global downgraded Tether's USDT to its lowest "Weak" stability rating, rekindling concerns over stablecoin vulnerabilities, and rising Japanese government bond yields signaled a potential acceleration in the yen carry-trade unwind, pulling liquidity out of risk assets like Bitcoin. In our view, as crypto becomes increasingly institutionalized, macroeconomic factors will play an outsized role in dictating price action. For Bitcoin to avert a deeper bear phase, it must defend the critical $80,000–$82,000 support zone amid ongoing volatility. Key Charts to Watch BTC has remained weak this month, dipping to around $80k before rebounding. However, the overall rebound lacks strength and is highly likely to retest the $80k zone. A break below could lead to a decline toward the next key support at $73k. $ZEC failed to sustain its prior strength and retraced into a demand zone. As a move driven by fundamentals & spot demand, $ZEC’s current cycle may not yet be over—closely monitor price action at the support level. The AI Infrastructure Throne is Shaking In November, the AI sector presented a complex landscape of strong fundamentals yet escalating competition. The chip behemoth NVIDIA delivered better-than-expected earnings, but its stock price experienced significant volatility due to news that Meta plans to shift towards Google TPU chips. This sparked market concern that the monopolistic structure of AI infrastructure might be loosening. On the model front, Google formally released its flagship model, Gemini 3 Pro, boasting a 1M token context window and powerful multimodal capabilities, solidifying its position in the model arms race. Notably, China's Moonshot AI Lab also launched its kimi-k2-thinking model this month. This model, which utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, achieves high-performance inference at extremely low training costs. This marks an intensification of the global open-source AI model competition, providing the decentralized AI community with a new low-cost, high-efficiency model option. AI Bubble FUD Spills Over The volatility in the stock prices and valuations of AI giants directly impacted the cryptocurrency market through the risk sentiment transmission chain. As high-beta core assets of the US tech sector, the short-term correction in AI concept stocks triggered a broader sell-off in "Risk-On Assets." This stock-crypto market linkage was prominent in November: the decline of market leaders like NVIDIA heightened fears of an AI bubble, subsequently leading to selling pressure on the crypto market near critical price points. Crypto AI Projects also Cooking The cryptocurrency AI track remained highly active and innovative in November. Infrastructure leader Bittensor (TAO) continued to expand its subnet ecosystem and attracted institutional capital through an ETP listing in the European market, with market focus shifting to its first halving mechanism in December. In terms of compute power, Render (RNDR) officially launched its Compute Subnet, transitioning into a pure AI inference computing network. The application and agent layers saw real-world stress testing: nof1.ai's Alpha Arena Season 1.5 commenced, deploying $320,000 in real capital, pitting multiple AI models, including Gemini 3 Pro and kimi-k2-thinking, against each other in real-time cryptocurrency and US stock token trading on the Hyperliquid DEX, directly placing the AI models' investment judgment capabilities in a competitive arena. Prediction Markets Enter Normalized High-Liquidity Era The prediction market’s weekly volume exceeded $3.6 billion in November, significantly surpassing the 2024 election peak. In our view, the market has successfully transitioned from an "event-driven" model to a phase of "normalized high liquidity." Polymarket maintains its stable retail user base, while Kalshi, leveraging compliance and institutional capital, has caught up to and, in periods, overtaken Polymarket in transaction volume. The Monad-based Opinion protocol surged in Q4, rapidly capturing a significant market share and challenging the established duopoly. Polymarket Builders Ecosystem: High Concentration & Strategic Value Extreme Volume Concentration: The Builders program has created a highly concentrated structure, with Betmoar dominating the ecosystem by capturing an astonishing 68.49% of all third-party front-end transaction volume. This highlights an "extreme head effect" driven by superior UX or specific incentives. Tier 2 Differentiation: The second tier, led by Standtrade (9.8%) and Polytraderpro (7.77%), proves that specialized interfaces (e.g., Pro tools for traders) still hold significant volume and room for differentiated competition. Strategic Long Tail: The remaining volume (~14%) is held by long-tail projects (like Polycule and Matchr.xyz). Though small, these independent front-ends are critical to Polymarket's overall censorship resistance and global market penetration. Stablecoin Flows Just Printed the Most Bearish Bar in a Year Stablecoin inflows have slowed significantly, with the next period's data being extremely critical. This month, stablecoins continued to see inflows, but the volume has slowed markedly, reaching the lowest level ($1.9B) in nearly a year. The next period's data is highly critical and could lead to two possible scenarios: Economic Data & Events to Watch in December 2025 About CoinEx Established in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind.

Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:01:58Z

Company expected to redirect investment to augmented reality glasses Tech giant Meta is reportedly looking to make cuts in its Reality Labs metaverse division, the home of the Quest VR headest and the Horizon Worlds platform. That's according to Bloomberg, which reports that execs at the company are eying up budget reductions of as much as 30% during 2026. Layoffs might be take place as early as January. The company is planning cuts across the board, but more extensively to the metaverse division because it has not seen significant competition in the space, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. Investors and analysts have been demanding the company reduce its heavily lossmaking investments in the sector, which run at billions of dollars per quarter. The firm is reportedly not looking to abandon its metaverse plans, but is moving the money it is saving with these cuts into its augmented reality glasses, currently produced in partnership with Ray-Ban, according to additional reporting by the New York Times. “Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio, we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse towards AI glasses and wearables, given the momentum there. We aren’t planning any broader changes than that,” a Meta spokesperson told the FT. Following the Bloomberg report, the company's stock shot up 5.5% when the markets opened on Thursday morning, suggesting investor approval for the changes. Meta's share price ended the day 3.4% higher. In February 2025, Meta disclosed that despite its Meta Quest hardware yielding $1.08 billion in revenue, the Reality Labs division recorded a $4.97 billion loss. This part of the company has been in the red for much of its existence and lost over $70 billion since the company pivoted to focus on the metaverse. For the three months ending September 30, 2025, Meta reported a $4.4 billion operational loss – largely in line with the previous year's figures – while for the nine months ending September 30th, this loss comes to $13.2 billion, a 3% increase year-on-year. Meta CFO Susan Li told investors that the company expected lower Reality Labs revenue for its Q4, which ends on December 30, 2025. Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms back in 2021, such was Zuckerburg and co.'s conviction that the metaverse was the future of digital communication. Despite Meta's more recent focus on AI, the company announced last month that it was cutting 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. The cuts would be the latest in a series of significant job losses at the company. In January of this year, Meta cut 5% of its workforce, estimated to be around 3,600 staff, while in 2023, it laid off 10,000 workers and retired 5,000 open roles.

Oracle debt is spiraling toward 2008-era danger, with five-year CDS jumping to 125 bps and possibly hitting 200 bps in 2026 as AI spending soars. Oracle’s debt has surged to $104 billion in FY2025 and may hit $290 billion by FY2028 as free cash flow turns negative for the first time since 1999. Ratings outlook is now negative. Other hyperscalers remain stronger with large cash reserves. AI capex is rising fast to $600 billion by 2027, intensifying credit risks.

Title: Are retail investors trying to tell us something about Apple?

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As an avid Apple Music user, I felt left out on Spotify Wrapped Day earlier this week. Most of my Spotify-using friends and coworkers gleefully swapped musical tastes all day long as I sat on the outside. "But Apple has an intuitive interface and superior audio quality," I mumbled into my coffee, to no one in particular. As it turns out, retail investors have been similarly treating Apple like an afterthought. During the shortened Thanksgiving week, they piled into every Magnificent 7 stock but Apple, pulling $96 million out, according to JPMorgan data. (For context, Nvidia led inflows with $650 million.) What's more, JPMorgan found that day traders have been consistent sellers of Apple throughout the year. This matches data from Schwab showing that its clients were net sellers of Apple during the third quarter. The reason is relatively straightforward to anyone who's followed the AI race this year: Apple is behind — or at least that's the perception investors have. While fellow contestants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta loudly pile tens of billions of dollars into AI and ink huge deals with one another, Apple has been its typically quiet self. The secrecy and painstaking caution that helped the company create and mass-manufacture some of the world's most ubiquitous consumer products is now viewed as a drawback. Apple's competitors are growing more aggressive, and it's struggling to match that energy. Reflective of cooling retail interest is middling stock performance for Apple, especially by its high standards. It's up 12% year to date, trailing the S&P 500 by almost five percentage points. This is a company that's exceeded a 30% annual return in five of the last six years! And it's not just retail investors getting cold feet about Apple. Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its holding in the company by two-thirds from its peak position (although the stock remains Berkshire's top holding by value). Viking Global went as far as to offload its entire stake in the fourth quarter of last year. As for how it's going at Apple right now, it's hard to ignore the exit of the company's AI chief. Sure, there's a talent war raging in the industry, but Apple has more cash on hand than most small nations. If it wanted to pay up to keep key people, it could. It also doesn't help that criticism is coming from high places. A co-creator of the tech behind Siri recently said it was a misstep to make the AI agent voice-only. Still, I'd stop short of breaking out the violins for Apple. It remains an undeniable juggernaut. But it does have newly resurgent Alphabet nipping at its heels, and Microsoft isn't far behind. It could soon lose its spot as the second-most-valuable company. Ultimately, there's a difference between being a mega-profitable behemoth and also having your stock price trounce peers and go straight up forever. Apple eventually might have to settle for the former. Jump to

Title: Reddit's CEO says the platform is ditching a key part that 'sucks'

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reddit is getting rid of one of its oldest fixtures. The platform's CEO, Steve Huffman, said in a post that Reddit would be removing its r/popular feed from the homepage for new users to promote a more personalized and relevant user experience. The popular feed, located on the left sidebar of the website, displays the most liked recent posts across the platform. "In theory, it's what's most popular on Reddit, but it's actually what is liked by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing," he said. "Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO)." He summed up his disdain for the feature by saying, "r/popular sucks, and we're moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds." Huffman, who has been the platform's CEO since 2015, said Reddit would stop showing the popular feed in the sidebar unless users read it regularly. He said his favorite part of Reddit was that every community on the platform had its own unique culture, rules, and sense of humor. "And if your perspective isn't represented, you can create the community you want to see," he said. "The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit." The platform gets 116 million visitors daily, he said. Reddit's stock price has risen about 44% in the past year. In the post, he announced a few other changes, like limiting the number of high-traffic communities a single person can moderate, and changing the way it shows community sizes. "These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today," he said. This is not Reddit's first effort to nudge its users into smaller community groups, as it recalibrates its platform alongside competitors like Quora, and beyond that, the likes of Meta. In October, Reddit removed its public chat feature and urged users to chat on private group chats as a way to "connect with communities in smaller, focused spaces." Jump to

Major U.S. equities indexes wavered between gains and losses Thursday afternoon, as tech stocks climbed but consumer staples stocks lost ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% lower in recent trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ticked up 0.1%. Dollar General (DG) led gains on the S&P 500, with its stock up close to 12% after the discount retailer became the latest to post solid quarterly results, after a strong report from rival Dollar Tree (DLTR) yesterday. Meta Platforms (META) shares also surged, with shares jumping 4% following a Bloomberg report the Facebook and Instagram parent is looking to slash spending on its metaverse segment next year. Kroger (KR) was the largest decliner in the S&P 500. Its shares fell 6% after the grocery giant reported quarterly sales that missed analysts' expectations. Snowflake (SNOW) shares tumbled 11% after the cloud data analytics company issued a disappointing margin forecast, raising some worries on Wall Street about the company's AI-related investments. Intel's (INTC) stock sank 6%, giving up most of its gains earlier in the week. Reuters reported the embattled chipmaker, which has explored selling parts of its business to improve its finances, plans to keep its networking and communications segment after a strategic review. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.10%. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro and yen, while gaining on the pound. The price of Bitcoin slipped to trade just above $92,000 and Ethereum gained, while most other major cryptocurrencies lost ground.

Traditional survey-based feedback has given way to real-time online reviews, yet transforming this unstructured text into actionable knowledge remains difficult. Focusing on the highly competitive smartphone market, where customer sentiment shapes brand perception and product strategy, this study proposes an end-to-end analytics pipeline that combines Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), topic modelling, and interactive visualisation. Reviews for ten smartphone brands from Amazon (n ≈ 68 k) were pre-processed and class-imbalanced data were mitigated through class weighting. Sentiment classification was performed with ML models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes) and DL models (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)). CNN achieved the highest accuracy 85.07% and balanced performance across positive and negative classes, although all models struggled with neutral reviews. Underlying themes were extracted with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF); quantitative evaluation using the Coherence Score (CS) showed that NMF produced more interpretable topics (CS = 0.54) than LDA (CS = 0.41). Topic-level sentiment was assessed with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER), linking features such as battery life and camera quality to positive or negative customer attitudes. Results are delivered through an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows practitioners to track sentiment trends, drill into coherent topics, and compare brand performance. The study also discusses ethical considerations, such as potential bias from imbalanced or culturally nuanced language, and outlines future work on cross-domain generalisation and fairness auditing. Overall, the integrated pipeline demonstrates that coupling CNN-based sentiment analysis with high-coherence NMF topics provides richer, business-ready insights than sentiment analysis alone.

Before the advent of the Internet, people typically visited physical stores to purchase products. Businesses could only provide feedback forms to customers for them to fill out to provide feedback on their products or customer experiences. The traditional manual feedback collection methods were often time-consuming for customers as they required filling out lengthy questionnaires and some customers might hesitate to complete the forms due to inconvenience. Hence, the data collected was limited for businesses to analyse and gain insights into customer opinions and preferences. The rise of online e-commerce platforms has transformed this landscape. Customers can now leave reviews at any time, making feedback collection faster and more efficient. Businesses can access these reviews in real-time, allowing for quicker responses and more informed decision-making. The Internet has increased the volume and significance of customer reviews, turning them into a crucial resource. A study by Forrester found that over 30% of Internet users have shared their opinions on products online. Consumers are more likely to trust the feedback from other customer rather than relying on company advertisements [1]. Consumers gradually trust the experiences of other buyers over advertisements, which has shifted the focus of businesses toward analysing online reviews to improve customer satisfaction and product offerings. In the rapidly growing smartphone market, brands like Samsung and Apple dominate, and e-commerce platforms like Amazon play a critical role in shaping consumer behaviour. Online reviews for smartphones have become important tools for both businesses and consumers, providing not only numerical ratings but also detailed feedback that helps buyers make informed purchasing decisions. The smartphone industry, with its constant innovation and competition, presents a unique opportunity to explore how sentiment analysis can help brands understand customer perceptions and stay competitive. Despite the abundance of online reviews, extracting actionable insights from large datasets remains a challenge. Traditional sorting methods, such as filtering by ratings, fail to capture the nuances in customer sentiment. Sentiment analysis, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), addresses this by categorizing reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. While sentiment analysis has been applied across industries, limited research exists on its application within the smartphone sector. Existing studies often lack integration with topic detection and fail to utilize interactive dashboards for deeper insights. This study bridges this gap by addressing the research question: By incorporating these techniques, this research aims to offer a holistic approach to analysing customer feedback, aiding businesses in improving brand perception and competitive positioning. The objective of this research is to explore the growing importance of customer reviews in the smartphone industry. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyse Amazon customer reviews, this study aims to address gaps in existing research. Amazon’s extensive consumer feedback makes it an ideal dataset for this research. Through text mining, sentiment analysis, and topic detection, this study seeks to: This research will deepen the understanding of how customer reviews shape brand perception and provide businesses with practical tools to enhance their brand image in a competitive market. This study introduces a novel end-to-end pipeline that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) sentiment classification with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic detection and deploys the joint results in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Earlier work either relied on separate sentiment or topic models or required resource-intensive Large Language Models (LLMs), leaving practitioners without a single, interpretable workflow for real-time brand monitoring. By unifying CNN, NMF, and dashboard visualisation, our approach links polarity scores to specific discussion themes at scale and presents them in an operationally ready format. Beyond this technical novelty, we analyse customer reviews for ten leading smartphone brands, applying multiple ML algorithms to benchmark performance and demonstrate that our lightweight CNN-NMF pipeline achieves competitive accuracy while remaining resource efficient. The resulting interactive dashboards provide businesses with practical tools to track sentiment-topic trends, diagnose emerging issues, and tailor strategic responses. Consequently, the study advances academic understanding of integrated sentiment-topic modelling and delivers actionable guidance for industry stakeholders seeking to enhance brand reputation, customer loyalty, and product development. The structure of this research is as follows: Section 1 introduces the research topic, detailing its background, objectives, and contribution. Section 2 reviews relevant literature, summarizing key findings and identifying gaps in current knowledge. Section 3 outlines the research methodology, describing the methods and techniques employed in the study. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, including a detailed analysis and interpretation of the data. Section 5 concludes with recommendations based on the research findings. The remaining sections include the references list and appendix with supplementary materials. Online customer reviews are closely linked to brand perception, as they directly influence how consumers view a company’s products and services. This perception develops through multiple channels such as traditional advertising, word-of-mouth recommendations, and customer service experiences. However, the influence of digital platforms has become increasingly prominent. Online reviews, social media interactions, and digital marketing campaigns now play a key role in shaping consumer perceptions to make brand management more complex. According to [2] study, brand perception is considered a multi-dimensional construct, containing experimental, symbolic, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. This framework views brand perception through several lenses: the experimental dimension, which relates to direct interactions and experiences with the brand; the symbolic dimension, which relates to the brand’s image and associations; the emotional dimension, reflecting the feelings and emotional responses caused by the brand; and the cognitive dimension, which involves the intellectual evaluation and beliefs about the brand. Each of these dimensions contributes to how consumers form and adjust their perceptions of a brand. Building on Keller’s framework [2], Christodoulides [3] further categorize brand perception into three critical types: brand experience, brand affect, and brand trust. Brand experience focuses on the experiential interactions consumers have with the brand, brand affect captures the emotional responses towards it, and brand trust deals with the cognitive sense of reliability and safety when engaging with the brand. These dimensions are essential for understanding consumer behaviour, especially in the context of online apparel purchases where brand perception is continually shaped by digital interactions. For instance, a brand that good in delivering positive direct experiences and consistently communicates a strong image is more likely to foster positive emotional responses and be perceived as trustworthy and dependable. These dimensions are interrelated and often reinforce one another. In today’s digital landscape, the accessibility of online reviews allows companies to respond promptly to customer concerns and preferences, thereby strengthening customer relationships and building brand loyalty. A study by Vanani [4] found that brand communities on social networks, where customers share experiences and viewpoints, play a crucial role in shaping brand perception. Positive customer reviews can significantly enhance a brand’s reputation by amplifying favourable opinions and attract new customers. These reviews can help to build trust, reinforce brand identity, and contribute to long-term brand loyalty and success. By analysing a broad range of tweets, this study also showed that there is a significant correlation between customer support interactions and brand perception, indicating that good customer service can influence future company reputation, customer loyalty, and churn rates. Rapid and effective responses to customer inquiries and issues can lead to the improvement of customer sentiments about the brand. Customer reviews have become an essential component of brand perception as they provide insights into consumer experiences and sentiments, significantly influencing how a brand is perceived in the market. In the past, customer reviews were primarily collected through surveys or questionnaires, which provided limited data. For instance, a study [5] conducted a survey for H&M brands to analyse how social media can be used for branding purposes in Norway. The study found that client engagement with the brand was much higher on social media than through traditional methods, suggesting that brands should focus more on their social media presence. The authors also noted that the 28 questions in the questionnaire were not sufficient to cover the research subject comprehensively. In contrast, today’s digital landscape offers more dynamic ways to collect customer reviews through social media, e-commerce platforms, and public data sources. This modern approach allows businesses to quickly adapt to consumer needs and refine their market strategies. Analysing customer opinions is crucial for companies’ global growth, as feedback serves as a valuable tool for evaluating reviews and addressing criticisms effectively [6]. Social media platforms like Twitter have become useful resources for sentiment analysis, with tools like Tweepy, a Twitter streaming API, enabling the collection of tweets on specific topics [7]. For example, research [8] used Tweepy to gather 99,850 tweets mentioning “Nike” and “Adidas” across various dates in 2018 as part of a comparative study to gauge public opinion on these leading international apparel brands. Their research revealed that most customers rely on online product reviews before making a purchase, highlighting the growing importance of public customer reviews as a vital resource for businesses aiming to improve product design and offerings. Positive reviews and high ratings significantly influence potential buyers and enhance a brand’s reputation. Further highlighting the significance of customer sentiment reflected in reviews, study [9] conducted an aspect-based sentiment analysis on a dataset of various car brands obtained from the Kaggle website. Their findings demonstrated that a higher sentiment score is linked with an increased likelihood of consumers choosing that brand, particularly in the competitive automotive industry. These insights are helpful for brand managers and stakeholders, who can use them to sustain brand reputation and profitability by proactively addressing consumer concerns related to product reliability. They found that Lamborghini achieved the highest sentiment score among the car brands analysed, reflecting strong customer satisfaction, particularly in areas such as comfort and price justification. This illustrates how a higher sentiment score can significantly boost customer preference, with Lamborghini owners expressing satisfaction with the quality and value of their vehicles. This case highlights the critical role that positive sentiment plays in enhancing a brand’s reputation and influencing consumer choices. Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting and interpreting textual data to understand its emotional content through text mining and processing techniques. NLP techniques are used in sentiment analysis to categorise sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. This powerful tool is widely used across diverse industries such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and politics to analyse public opinion, improve product development, and support strategic decision-making. Another research [10] utilised NLP techniques to examine game reviews and categorise them into positive or negative sentiments. NLP offers several benefits in game studies, such as automated review analysis and the identification of gameplay patterns that can help improve game design. However, NLP techniques also face challenges, including difficulty in capturing language nuances such as sarcasm and irony, potential inaccuracies with context-specific language, limited generalisation of diverse player perspectives, and dependence on domain expertise for accurate interpretation. Moreover, techniques for sentiment analysis range from lexicon-based methods to advanced ML and Deep Learning (DL) models. Lexicon-based approaches, like those used by [11] and [12] in social media sentiment analysis, assign predefined sentiment scores to words or phrases. The opinion lexicon-based method, where a lexicon consisting of positive and negative opinion words is used to evaluate sentiment in sentences as positive, negative, or neutral. This widely used method involves applying a scoring function to each sentence, based on the presence of these opinion words. These methods are simple and computationally efficient but often lack the contextual understanding needed for accurate sentiment interpretation. For example, sarcasm, irony, or idiomatic expressions can easily lead to misinterpretation because the lexicon-based approach does not account for context beyond the predefined sentiment scores. Despite these drawbacks, lexicon-based methods continue to be widely used, especially in scenarios where speed is prioritized over depth of analysis. They serve as a foundational tool in sentiment analysis, often combine with more advanced techniques to enhance accuracy. As data grow in complexity, ML-based sentiment analysis models, such as Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM), offer powerful tools for analysing social media data, as demonstrated by [13–15]. These models can adapt to new data and capturing complex sentiment patterns. However, they necessitate large, labelled datasets and substantial computational resources. Their findings revealed that SVM achieved the highest predictive accuracy after cross-validation, outperforming the other models in most cases. This underscores the general observation that SVMs often deliver better performance compared to other classification models. With the increasing volume of data, traditional classification models often face efficiency challenges, making DL models particularly advantageous for sentiment analysis. These models, such as CNN, Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), offer benefits like automatic feature extraction, faster computation with accelerated hardware, and robust performance with large datasets [16,17]. Studies show that LSTM outperforms CNN and Simple RNN due to its ability to retain word sequences and capture long-range dependencies, which are crucial for accurate sentiment analysis. While overfitting was initially a challenge, it was addressed by optimizing parameters. Another research [18] also found that LSTM outperformed lexicon-based methods for calculating brand sentiment, though its high resource demands limited analysis to shorter timeframes. In recent years, the use of LLMs like BERT, GPT, and Llama has become increasingly common in sentiment analysis. Study [19] demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs over traditional transformers in identifying depressive content in Bengali social media posts, yielding good outcomes. These models, which are trained on huge amounts of text, are capable of understanding and human-like language with high accuracy. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced by Google in 2018, was one of the first LLMs to make a significant impact in this area. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), known for powering tools like ChatGPT, has also gained widespread recognition. Llama2, a more recent model from Meta, builds on the foundational transformer architecture with some enhancements. A study by Kwon [20] explored the use of these models for sentiment classification, comparing their performance with traditional and DL models. The study found that BERT and GPT outperformed others, achieving an F1-score above 0.9. However, the research also highlighted challenges associated with these LLMs. For instance, training these models, required considerable computational time and resources [21]. Llama, despite being a powerful model, showed lower accuracy in this study and demanded significant resources in terms of memory and training time. Additionally, further fine-tuning Llama proved to be time-consuming, making it less practical compared to the more efficient BERT and GPT models. Beyond sentiment analysis, topic detection plays a crucial role in interpreting large volumes of customer feedback, particularly from platforms like Twitter, where texts are often brief and incorporate slang. As short-text analysis gains prominence, [22] and [23]proposed two widely used methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and NMF for clustering these texts into coherent topics. Their findings suggest that while both models are effective, NMF generally outperforms LDA, offering more distinct topic classifications in short-text analysis. Furthermore, [24] conducted a systematic review of the airline industry, applying sentiment analysis and topic modelling to demonstrate their practical utility in various industries. Integrating these techniques enables a deeper understanding of consumer feedback, proving invaluable for businesses seeking actionable insights. Brand sentiment analysis focuses on evaluating consumer perceptions of a brand, informing marketing strategies, product development, and brand management. As customer feedback volume increases, sentiment classification has become a significant research area, helping businesses leverage customer opinions for better decision-making. This analysis predicts customer attitudes towards brand products and services and provides insights into consumer behaviour by systematically examining feedback to understand brand perception. Another research [13] emphasize sentiment analysis as a crucial tool for understanding customer sentiment, allowing businesses to strategically target advertisements based on positive reviews. A study [12] demonstrated the efficiency of sentiment analysis over traditional surveys by using Twitter data to create visual representations that can help businesses in understanding customer opinions. The study [25] underscore the importance of sentiment analysis in extracting actionable insights from reviews, although challenges such as sarcasm and nuanced language can affect accuracy. The process of gathering and labelling data for ML can be time-consuming, especially with large datasets [26,27]. Correlating sentiment analysis with customer ratings helps reveal how reviews impact overall satisfaction and supports data-driven decision-making. Another research [28] used sentiment analysis at the document, sentence, and aspect levels to categorise Amazon mobile phone reviews, capturing overall sentiment, specific preferences, and detailed product features. Nevertheless, the study encountered limitations, such as the reliance on the Afinn lexicon, which may yield different results with other tools, and the manual extraction of main product features, which could vary with different methods. The research also emphasised the need for validation with other corpora and the inclusion of n-gram features and qualifiers. In contexts like Twitter, where specific sentiment labels may be missing, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) are an effective tool for assessing sentiment. Specifically designed for social media, VADER able to measure both the polarity and intensity of emotions, considering language tones and even emojis. Pai [29] highlighted its ability to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on sentiment scores, making it particularly useful for short-text analysis. Mishra [9] applied VADER in the automotive industry, finding that higher sentiment scores were linked to increased brand preference. These insights are valuable for brand managers to enhance reputation and address consumer concerns. VADER is easy to implement and does not require extensive training data, making it accessible for both researchers and businesses looking to perform sentiment analysis without needing complex ML models. Prior investigations typically addressed sentiment analysis and topic modelling in isolation or required resource‑intensive LLMs that limit practical deployment. Few works link polarity, topic context, and decision‑support visualisation in a unified workflow. By integrating a lightweight CNN for sentiment classification with Non‑Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction and presenting the joint results in an interactive Tableau dashboard, our study overcomes those fragmentation and scalability challenges. This end‑to‑end pipeline demonstrates that near‑state‑of‑the‑art accuracy, granular topic insights, and real‑time business intelligence can coexist without the computational overhead of LLMs. Consequently, the proposed method advances the state of the art by delivering an interpretable, resource‑efficient, and operationally ready framework that directly maps consumer narratives to actionable brand strategies. This study utilized a comprehensive dataset of Amazon reviews, obtained through Kaggle [30]for its accessibility and relevance. This dataset was selected due to its easier accessibility compared to data from social media platforms, which require payment. Additionally, Amazon is one of the world’s largest online retailers, making its review data highly comprehensive. The Amazon customer review dataset consists of two CSV files: ‘items’ and ‘reviews’. The ‘items’ CSV file provides summarised information such as Product ASIN, Product Brand, Product Name, Product URL, Product Image URL, Product Avg. Rating, Product Review Page URL, Product Total Reviews, Product Price ($), and Product Original Price ($). The ‘reviews’ CSV file contains detailed customer reviews including Product ASIN, Reviewer Name, Reviewer Rating (on a scale of 1–5), Review Date, Valid Customer Indicator, Review Title, Review Content, and Helpful Feedback. This dataset encompasses 67,987 Amazon customer reviews across ten different smartphone brands: ASUS, Apple, Google, HUAWEI, Motorola, Nokia, OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi, ranging from November 24, 2003, to December 25, 2019. Moreover, the reviews in the dataset are accompanied by ratings ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 denotes the lowest rating and 5 signifies the highest. There is detailed content associated with each rating as well as information on the product and brand name. Overall, the dataset includes a total of 714 products across ten brands, making it a good source for conducting detailed sentiment analysis. Data processing involved refining the dataset by removing null values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns (e.g., URLs). The ‘items’ and ‘reviews’ files were merged using an inner join on the product “ASIN” attribute, resulting in a consolidated dataset named “Amazon_phone_review.csv”. Reviews were categorized using an automated Python-based heuristic labelling strategy: ratings of 1–2 were labelled as “Negative” 3 as “Neutral” and 4–5 as “Positive” as shown in Fig 1. This process resulted in a streamlined dataset of over 60,000 labelled reviews prepared for sentiment analysis. During model training, class weights were applied to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and ensure that underrepresented sentiment categories contributed proportionally to the loss function. This approach improved classification fairness without modifying the original data distribution. To implement this strategy, class weights were computed from the training set using the compute_class_weight function in the scikit-learn library. The resulting weight vector [Negative = 1.39, Neutral = 4.89, Positive = 0.50] reflects the inverse frequency of each sentiment class in the data. For traditional ML algorithms, these weights were supplied through the class_weight parameter (where supported) to ensure the loss function penalised mistakes on minority classes more heavily. For DL models, the same weights were passed to the fit method in Keras, thereby scaling the categorical cross-entropy loss during training. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g001 To provide an overview of the dataset, multiple visualisations were generated using Python. First, Fig 2 reveals that the Samsung brand received the highest number of reviews, whereas the ASUS brand received the fewest. Apple, Nokia, and Xiaomi received a similar count of reviews. According to this distribution, there is a significant difference in customer engagement among brands, with Samsung dominating in terms of customer feedback volume. Next, Fig 3 shows that the average rating for all brands exceeds 3.5, with Nokia having the lowest average rating at around 3.3. While most brands have generally received positive reviews from their customers, Nokia’s products are likely to receive more critical reviews than other brands. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g002 The red dashed line indicates the overall mean rating across all brands, serving as a benchmark for comparative evaluation. The red dashed line indicates the overall mean rating across all brands, serving as a benchmark for comparative evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g003 Fig 4 presents the distribution of reviews over time by brand from 2003 to 2020. Initially, from 2003 to 2008, reviews were exclusively for Motorola mobile phones. This could be due to Motorola’s early entry into the market or its popularity during that period. Subsequently, reviews began to appear for other brands, and the number of reviews steadily increased over the years. This reflects the growing diversity and competition in the smartphone market. Notably, Samsung received the most reviews overall, indicating its popularity over the years. On the other hand, in the case of the Xiaomi brand, reviews only began to appear after 2018. This late entry into the review dataset indicates that Xiaomi’s market presence significantly increased around this period. The number of reviews has continually increased since then, peaking in 2020. This trend highlights Xiaomi’s rapid growth and rising consumer interest in recent years. The detailed analysis of these visualisations provides valuable insights into customer behaviour and market trends over time, which can be crucial for strategic decision-making. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g004 Fig 5 displays the sentiment distribution of Amazon smartphone reviews. The dataset comprises 68.51 percent positive, 24.50 percent negative, and 6.99 percent neutral reviews based on the labelled ratings. To enhance statistical robustness, 95 percent confidence intervals were computed for each sentiment category using the normal approximation method for binomial proportions, from a total of over 60,000 reviews. The resulting estimates are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g005 To explore brand-specific sentiment differences, data from the most recent complete year, 2019, were analysed, as all ten brands were represented with sufficient review counts. As summarised in Table 2, Xiaomi, HUAWEI, and OnePlus received the highest proportions of positive reviews above 80%, reflecting strong consumer satisfaction. In contrast, Nokia showed the highest proportion of negative reviews 36.69%, indicating comparatively lower customer satisfaction. Samsung maintained a strong positive sentiment 71.50% consistent with its market leadership, whereas Apple exhibited a higher share of negative reviews 26.95%, possibly reflecting heightened user expectations. These differences demonstrate how brand reputation and product performance are reflected in sentiment patterns within the same market year. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t002 However, other sources of imbalance such as the uneven temporal and brand distribution of reviews were not explicitly addressed. For example, some brands only appear in later years (e.g., Xiaomi), which may influence the model’s ability to generalize across brands and time periods. Future work could explore temporal resampling or brand-stratified evaluation to better account for these biases. Raw text data usually contains noise or irrelevant information that can impact the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis. An effective text data preprocessing is crucial for preparing raw text data for sentiment analysis. This process involves several key steps, including cleaning the data, lemmatizing with POS (part-of-speech) tagging, removing stop words, and tokenizing text. Each of these steps plays a vital role in transforming the raw data into a format that can be effectively analysed by ML algorithms. Firstly, text cleaning is performed by removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers. This step is important because cleaning the text helps reduce noise, making the core content more accessible and analysable. Removing irrelevant information allows the model to focus on the significant features of the text, leading to better performance in sentiment analysis. Additionally, the text is standardised by converting all characters to lowercase. For instance, “BUY” or “Buy” is converted to “buy.” Without this step, words that are the same could be treated differently by text processing algorithms simply due to case differences, thereby reducing the accuracy of results. This standardisation helps create a uniform dataset, which is crucial for accurate analysis. To further refine the dataset, the contractions in the text data is also expanded; for example, “don’t” is converted to “do not.” This ensures that words are not counted separately, thus maintaining consistency. After that, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)‘s predefined stop-words list is used to remove common stop words like “a,” “the,” and “is.” This enhances model performance by highlighting important words that carry the meaning of the text. In the last step of our text preprocessing, lemmatization with POS tagging is applied by using WordNet Lemmatizer from NLTK. POS tagging involves assigning a specific label such as noun, verb, adjective, etc, to each word in the sentence. This labelling is essential because it provides contextual information that helps in accurate lemmatization. Lemmatization helps to reduce words to their base form and standardise text data. For instance, the word “purchasing” is reduced to its base form “purchase.” By applying the lemmatization process, the text data was further cleaned and standardized, reducing words to their root forms while preserving their essential meanings. This comprehensive preprocessing ensures our dataset is well-prepared for subsequent sentiment analysis shown in Fig 6 and Fig 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g007 Following these preprocessing steps, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method is employed for feature extraction. TF-IDF is calculated using the formula [15], which is illustrated in Equation 1: The TF-IDF scheme is particularly effective at emphasizing terms that frequently appear in each document. Term frequency (TF) quantifies the frequency of a term’s occurrence within a specific document. The TF-IDF method combines (Term Frequency) TF with the inverse document frequency (IDF) to highlight the significance of a term within a document relative to the entire dataset. The pre-processed text data is then converted into numerical features that can be used for ML models. The TfidfVectorizer not only computes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values but also manages tokenization internally. These preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are essential for transforming raw text data into a format that enhances the effectiveness of subsequent analysis. Finally, the pre-processed text data was combined with essential attributes, such as “brand,” “rating,” and “sentiment,” for subsequent sentiment analysis. To prepare the data for model training and prediction with traditional classification models, data splitting was performed using the train_test_split function. This step divided the pre-processed dataset into training and testing subsets to ensure that the ML models could be effectively trained and evaluated. Specifically, 80% of the data was allocated to the training set, while 20% was reserved for the testing set. The testing set serves as a separate subset to evaluate the model’s performance and generalizability on unseen data. This split is crucial for assessing how well the model performs. On the other hand, DL models often work directly with raw or minimally processed data. Sentiment labels were converted into numerical format and then one-hot encoded using LabelEncoder. Texts were tokenized with the Tokenizer, configured to manage up to 10,000 words and out-of-vocabulary tokens. The tokenized sequences were then padded to a uniform length of 100 tokens. Subsequently, train_test_split was used again to divide the data into 80% of training and 20% of testing subsets. This ensured that both types of models received appropriately formatted and split datasets for effective training and evaluation. To ensure fair and systematic optimisation across models, a grid-search procedure was applied to both traditional ML and DL algorithms. For Decision Trees, the grid included max_depth ∈ {200, 400, 600, 800, 900}. Naïve Bayes was tuned with alpha ∈ {1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05}. Logistic Regression explored C ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 10}, solver ∈ {lbfgs, saga, sag}, and max_iter ∈ {100, 200, 300}. The SVM grid covered C ∈ {1, 5, 10}, kernel ∈ {linear, rbf}, and gamma ∈ {scale, auto}. For DL models, the CNN grid comprised kernel_size ∈ {3, 5, 7}, filters ∈ {64, 128}, and dropout_rate ∈ {0.2, 0.5}; training epochs were capped at 20 with Early Stopping patience of 3. The RNN and LSTM grids varied units ∈ {64, 100}, dropout ∈ {0.2, 0.3}, and learning_rate ∈ {0.001, 0.0005}. All grids were evaluated with five-fold cross-validation on the training set, and the best hyperparameter combination for each algorithm was selected according to mean validation accuracy. These chosen settings form the basis of the fine-tuning results reported in Section 4. The selection of traditional ML models for this study was guided by their established performance and interpretability in text classification and sentiment analysis tasks. Tree-based model such as Decision Trees was included because of their ability to handle nonlinear relationships, mixed feature types, and feature importance estimation. Naive Bayes models were chosen for their probabilistic foundation and efficiency in high-dimensional text data, particularly where word independence assumptions hold approximately true. Logistic Regression models were selected for their robustness, ease of interpretation, and effectiveness as strong linear baselines in sentiment prediction problems. SVM models were included due to their proven capability to generalise well in sparse feature spaces and to achieve strong discriminative boundaries in text-based classification. The models were assessed based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall. Neutral sentiments may be underrepresented in the dataset compared to positive and negative reviews. This imbalance can lead the model to focus more on the majority classes and perform poorly on the minority class. If the features of neutral reviews are not distinct enough, the model may struggle to classify them accurately. Other ML were not considered in order to maintain methodological focus and computational efficiency, as the primary aim was to benchmark the performance of diverse learning paradigms (probabilistic, linear, and non-linear) against advanced DL models. The selected models therefore represent a balanced mix of interpretability, generalisability, and computational practicality, making them well-suited to the sentiment classification objectives of this study. 3.7.1.1 Decision Trees: Decision Trees model has a tree-like structure, where each node represents a decision or test on an attribute, branches indicate the possible outcomes of these decisions, and leaf nodes signify the final predictions. In the context of classifying customer reviews, a hierarchy of decision nodes is built based on review features to categorise the reviews into different sentiment categories. In the context of our dataset, entropy is a key concept used to measure the uncertainty or randomness in the data, specifically in how the data is classified into different sentiment categories. The formula of splitting criterion – Entropy from [31] is shown below in Equation 2. where S is the dataset that entropy is calculated, c is the sentiment classes in set S, and p(c) – the proportion of elements belonging to class c in the dataset S. 3.7.1.2 Naive Bayes Model: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach for text classification that operates under the assumption that documents are created by a distribution determined by unseen parameters. The model estimates these parameters from the training data and uses Bayes’ theorem to calculate the likelihood of each class. It classifies documents by selecting the class with the highest probability. Naive Bayes model would first calculate the probability of the class [31], which is illustrated as in Equation 3: Here c represents data belonging to a particular sentiment class, x is the data with an unknown class, P(c|x) represents the posterior probability of the class given the predictor, P(x|c) is the predictor probability of the given class, P(c) – prior probability of the class, P(x) is the prior probability of the predictor. 3.7.1.3 Logistic Regression Model: Logistic Regression is a supervised learning technique that predicts the probability of a target variable by modelling the likelihood of a data point belonging to a specific class [32]. This model utilizes the logistic function, which maps input values to a probability range between 0 and 1, allowing it to classify data into discrete categories. The formula of Logistic Regression model [33] is illustrated as in Equation 4: where S(x) represents logistic function or sigmoid function, p refers to the probability of the dependent variable belonging to a particular class, e is the exponential function, and x means linear combination of the input features. This method is applicable in both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. According to the dataset used for this study, this model will estimate whether a review belongs to a positive, negative, or neutral category, and assigns it to the most likely category. In this study, Logistic Regression was implemented using a multinomial (SoftMax) formulation to accommodate the three sentiment categories (positive, negative, and neutral). The model was trained using the LogisticRegression class in scikit-learn with the parameter setting multi_class = ‘multinomial’ and the solver lbfgs. This approach estimates a separate set of coefficients for each sentiment class relative to a common baseline and computes class probabilities through the SoftMax function. The predicted sentiment label is then assigned based on the class with the highest probability. This configuration ensures that the model captures the full range of sentiment categories within a unified probabilistic framework, providing interpretable and generalisable classification outputs. 3.7.1.4 Support Vector Machine Model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful supervised ML algorithm that is widely used in classification tasks. This model operates by identifying the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes within a multidimensional space. The goal of the SVC is not just to find any hyperplane but to discover the one that maximizes the margin between classes, ensuring that the separation is as clear and distinct as possible [34,35]. The SVM model formula [14] is presented as follows in Equation 5: where W represents the weight of vector perpendicular to the hyperplane, X is the feature vector of a data point, and b is the bias term that adjusts the hyperplane from the origin. The margin is the distance between hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. The larger the margin, the better the model performance [32]. This combination of mathematical precision and strategic placement of the hyperplane makes SVC a highly effective tool in the realm of ML, particularly for tasks involving complex and high-dimensional data. 3.7.1.5 Training Procedure for Machine Learning Models: To ensure consistent evaluation across all ML classifiers, a standardized training procedure was adopted. Each model, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM was implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python (version 1.2.2). Prior to training, the dataset was split into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing subsets using stratified sampling, as described in Section 3.5. Feature vectors were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization, preserving token frequency information critical for classification. Hyperparameters for each model were optimized through grid search with five-fold cross-validation, using validation accuracy as the scoring metric. For Decision Trees, the maximum depth was varied in the range of 200–900; Logistic Regression was optimized across different solvers (lbfgs, saga, sag) and regularization strengths (C = 0.1 to 10); SVM tuning involved kernel choice (linear, RBF), penalty parameter (C = 1–10), and gamma settings. Naive Bayes used smoothing values (alpha) between 0.05 and 1.0. Class weights were adjusted in all models where applicable to handle the sentiment imbalance described in Section 3.2. All models were trained and tested under the same random seed (42) to enable reproducibility. Final model performance was reported based on the test set using metrics described in Section 3.7.3. In addition to the traditional ML models, DL models were also explored in this study to provide a broader comparison. These models known for their ability to capture complex patterns in data were included to assess whether they could outperform traditional models. In this study, deep neural network models including CNN, RNN and long-short term memory (LSTM) classifiers were employed. 3.7.2.1 Convolutional Neural Network: CNN are powerful feedforward neural networks commonly applied in fields like image classification or object recognition. CNN have recently been adapted for text classification with impressive results due to their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from raw data. A simple architecture of CNN is shown as Fig 8 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g008 CNN consists of embedding layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, flatten and dense layer. The process begins with an embedding layer, which converts raw text into numerical representations since ML and DL algorithms cannot process raw text directly. The convolutional layer identifies high-level features through a convolution operation by sliding the filters over the input sequence. After this, the pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps to decrease computational complexity and highlight the most relevant features [16]. Sometimes, the flatten layer is used to convert the feature maps into a single column vector, making them suitable for input into the dense layer. The dense layer is then employed to determine the class label, utilizing SoftMax activation functions for tasks involving multi-class classification. In this study, this model begins with an embedding layer that is added to convert word indices into dense vectors of fixed size and followed by a Conv1D layer with 128 filters and a kernel size of 5. ReLU activation function is then applied to capture local features from the text. Next, a MaxPooling1D layer with a pool size of 2 is used to retain the most important features. A Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 is included to prevent overfitting. Following this, a GlobalMaxPooling1D layer further down-samples the input representation by taking the maximum value across the entire dimension to reduce the computation while retaining crucial features. The model then includes a Dense layer with 128 units and a ReLU activation function for additional processing, followed by another Dropout layer to further mitigate overfitting. The final layer is a Dense layer with 3 units, corresponding to the three sentiment classes, and a SoftMax activation function to output a probability distribution over the classes. The model is compiled using the categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems, and the Adam optimizer, known for its efficiency and adaptive learning capabilities. The CNN was trained for 20 epochs using a batch size of 32. These parameters were selected through preliminary experiments involving a manual grid search approach. The kernel size of 5 was chosen based on its ability to capture short-range dependencies in review text, offering a balance between local pattern extraction and computational efficiency. Early experimentation showed that kernel sizes smaller than 5 underperformed in validation accuracy, while larger sizes increased training time without measurable gains. Similarly, the choice of 20 epochs was based on early stopping criteria and validation curve trends. The model exhibited peak performance around Epoch 15 and began showing signs of overfitting beyond that point. Training beyond 20 epochs offered minimal additional benefit while increasing the risk of overfitting and computational cost. These observations guided the final hyperparameter configuration, which is further discussed in the Results and Discussion sections. 3.7.2.2 Recurrent Neural Network: A RNN is a specialized form of artificial neural network designed to process sequential data, making it particularly effective for tasks such as language translation, NLP, and speech recognition [17]. RNN have a unique ability to retain information from previous inputs, which allows them to influence current and future outputs, enhancing their learning capability from training data [16] The formula for RNN model is shown as in Equation 6: where b is bias value, is the previous hidden state, which carries information from past time steps and is current input, which determines its influence on the current hidden state. This can be seen as a process where the RNN updates its memory (hidden state) at each time step by combining information from the previous hidden state and the current input, passing this combination through a non-linear activation function (tanh). This allows the network to process sequences of data in a way that invovle both the current input and the history of past inputs. The RNN model shown in Fig 9 in this study is designed with an Embedding layer, followed by a SpatialDropout1D layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to reduce overfitting. A single LSTM layer with 100 units is used with both dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.2 to further prevent overfitting. Adding LSTM layer in a model helps capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data. The model also includes a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation to capture complex features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g009 3.7.2.3 Long Short-Term Memory: LSTM is a specialized form of RNN designed to capture and learn long-term dependencies in data [20]. The architecture of LSTM is outlined in Fig 10. In LSTM model, the pre-processed input data is represented as an embedding matrix. The LSTM layers with number of units will process the data, followed by fully connected layer for classification task. The final layer will use an activation function to reduce the dimensional input vector down to a single output. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g010 Moreover, Fig 11 shows the mechanism of LSTM model. LSTM consists of a memory cell (ct) and three key non-linear gates: the input gate (it), the forget gate (ft) and the output gate (ot). The memory cells maintain a consistent state over time, while the gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell to ensure that relevant data is retained or discarded as needed. These mechanisms allow LSTMs to effectively retain relevant data over time. In short, LSTM networks employ a memory cell along with a set of gates to manage the storage, updating, and retrieval of information across extended sequences. These mechanisms allow LSTMs to effectively retain relevant data over time [17]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g011 In this study, the LSTM model was constructed starting with an Embedding layer, followed by a SpatialDropout1D layer, like the architecture used in the CNN and RNN models. This model consists of three LSTM layers, each with 100 units and dropout settings of 0.3 for both standard dropout and recurrent dropout. These layers enable the model to learn complex temporal relationships within the data. After the LSTM layers, there is a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation for additional feature processing. To avoid overfitting, a Dropout layer with a 0.5 rate is included. The final output is a Dense layer with 3 units and a SoftMax activation, suited for multi-class sentiment classification. Additionally, Reduce Learning Rate On Plateau (ReduceLROnPlateau) is used to lower the learning rate of the model when validation accuracy has stopped improving. 3.7.2.4 Training Procedure for Deep Learning Models: All DL experiments followed a unified training protocol to support reproducibility. For every network, the dataset was shuffled and stratified into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing splits as described in Section 3.5. Models were built with the Keras implementation in TensorFlow 2.14 and trained on a single NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU. The Adam optimizer was used with an initial learning_rate of 0.001 for the CNN and RNN, and 0.0005 for the LSTM network, reflecting the grid selections in Section 3.6. The batch_size was fixed at 32 across models for comparability. Early Stopping monitored validation loss with patience = 3 and restored the best performing weights. A ReduceLROnPlateau callback halved the learning rate if validation accuracy plateaued for two epochs. Each model was permitted a maximum of 20 epochs, although Early Stopping typically halted training earlier (CNN at epoch 7, RNN at epoch 9, LSTM at epoch 16). Training history, including loss and accuracy per epoch, was logged and the final weights were saved with a version tag corresponding to the best validation epoch. The same random seed (42) was set for NumPy and TensorFlow to ensure repeatability of results. To compare the effectiveness of various models, multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed. By analysing these metrics, strengths and weaknesses across different models can be identified, allowing for the selection of the most effective model for the task. Each metric offers insights into how well the models classify data. where P refers to precision, TP is the True Positive, which the instances where the model correctly identifies the positive class, and FP is False Positive which the instances where the model incorrectly predicts a positive class. where, FN is False Negative. The instances where the model fails to identify a positive class and incorrectly predicts it as negative. During evaluation, cross validation was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the models. Cross validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by evaluating its ability to make accurate predictions on new data [14]. The models were cross validated 5 times to ensure robust evaluation in this study. All model evaluations, including those during hyperparameter tuning and final testing, were conducted using five-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling to preserve class distribution across folds. Random shuffling of the dataset was performed before splitting to ensure robustness and reduce ordering bias. The same random seed (42) was used across all experiments to support reproducibility. To determine the topics in this dataset, two topics modelling are used in this section. Topic modelling can also be used for a variety of tasks such as detecting trends on social media or uncovering hidden themes in large text datasets. In this study, three topic detection models including LDA, and NMF are used to reveal insights from the dataset. LDA model is a generative probabilistic model that assumes K latent topics are hidden in given N documents corpus. This method is particularly useful in revealing the thematic structure of the dataset and allows for a nuanced understanding of the dominant topics present in the customer reviews. The generative process for each document in the text archive is presented as Fig 12 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g012 This process outlines how each document is generated in the entire corpus. Each document in the corpus is assumed to be a mix of these topics, and the words within the document are drawn from this mixture. The generative process is repeated for each document, leading to a probability model for the entire corpus. The model’s hidden variables, which represent the topic-word distributions (ϕ) and document-topic distributions (θ), are estimated using techniques like Gibbs sampling and variational algorithms by maximizing the probability P(D∣α, β) of the observed data given the model parameters. The formula of probability [22] is shown in Equation 11: The equation represents the likelihood of observing the entire corpus 𝐷, given the model's hyperparameters 𝛼 and 𝛽. The probability is denoted as 𝑃 (𝐷∣𝛼, 𝛽), where 𝛼 controls the distribution of topics within documents (document-topic distribution) and 𝛽 controls the distribution of words within topics (topic-word distribution). indicates that the likelihood is calculated as a product over all documents in the corpus (where 𝑁 is the total number of documents). The function 𝐹 (𝜃, 𝜙) represents the probability of observing all the words in document given the topic distribution and the topic-word distributions. In short, the process involves summing over all topic assignments for each word in each document and then multiplying these probabilities across all words and documents. The LDA model was constructed to uncover the five main topics within customer reviews across various brands. The text data was pre-processed and converted into a bag-of-words format. Using this corpus, an LDA model was constructed with a predefined number of topics, K as five topics. The model assumes that each review is a mixture of these topics, with each topic represented as a distribution over words. The final topics, represented by the top words within each topic, provide insights into the main themes filtered by each brand in customer reviews. NMF is a technique used to simplify complex data by breaking it down into non-negative components. NMF helps uncover hidden topics within the document by expressing each document as a combination of a few key themes. For each document, NMF represents it as a sum of these components, with specific weights showing how much each component contributes to that document. The process of NMF finding the best combination of components is done by minimizing the difference between the original data and the reconstructed version based on these components. The goal is to approximate the original matrix 𝐷 (which contains the data) as the product of two non-negative matrices, U and V. This is represented by the equation [22] below in Equation 12: where D is the original data matrix, U represents the topics, V shows how these components mix to recreate the original data and ∥ ⋅ ∥ F denotes the Frobenius norm, which measures the difference between the original and approximated matrices. Moreover, the formulas for U and V [22] are shown as below in Equation 13 and equation 14: These equations adjust U and V to minimize the difference between the original data and its approximation. The optimization process can be done by adjusting U to better fit the data D based on how well the current V represents D or adjusting V to better fit the data D based on how well the current U represents D. In this study, an NMF model was built to uncover five topics by brand. The process began by transforming the text data into a numerical format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. This method captures the importance of words in each document while considering their frequency across the entire corpus. The top ten words associated with each topic were then extracted to provide insights into the primary themes present in the reviews. To evaluate the quality of topics generated by the LDA and NMF models, we calculated the Coherence Score (CS) using the c_v metric. The CS measures the degree of semantic similarity between the most relevant words within a topic, thereby reflecting its interpretability. A higher CS suggests that the top words in a topic are more meaningfully related and thus more easily understood by humans. This metric is widely used in topic modelling evaluations to provide a quantitative assessment of how coherent or useful the generated topics are. In this study, CS values were computed using the gensim library in Python. After identifying the topics, the VADER sentiment analyser was applied to assess the sentiment associated with each brand. VADER is well known at analysing the sentiment of texts, including those with emojis and other social media-specific elements that other libraries might overlook. VADER provides four different sentiment scores: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. The positive, negative, and neutral scores represent the proportion of the text that falls into each category, while the compound score is a combined metric that sums up the overall sentiment of the text. This compound score ranges from −1 (indicating extremely negative sentiment) to 1 (indicating very positive sentiment) [4]. In this study, only the compound score is used to assess sentiment. By linking the sentiment scores to the topics generated by the topic detection model, the average sentiment for each topic across all reviews was calculated. This approach provided us with insights into not only the key themes present in the customer feedback but also the overall sentiment associated with each theme. For example, a topic related to phone camera feature might have a positive sentiment, while another topic related to product quality might be neutral. The results were categorized into sentiment types, Positive, Neutral, and Negative, based on the average sentiment scores, allowing for a clear understanding of how customers feel about various aspects of the brands they reviewed. Brand sentiment analysis is crucial for businesses to understand how customers perceive their products and services. By evaluating sentiments, companies can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and tailor their marketing strategies effectively. Overall, this model shown in Fig 13 allowed us to effectively combine topic modelling and sentiment analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer opinions for each brand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g013 In this section, the results from both traditional ML models and DL techniques are examined. The outcomes of each model are presented, with their performances compared to determine the most effective approach for the dataset. Additionally, the results of the brand topic detection model are explored, and each method is evaluated to identify the most suitable model. Finally, the VADER sentiment analysis tool is applied to assess the sentiment scores associated with the identified topics. As detailed in Table 3, the Decision Trees model achieved an average accuracy of 77.29% after running five cross-validation. It performs particularly well on the majority class, which is positive sentiments, with an average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.87. In contrast, its performance on negative sentiments is less robust, with average metrics of 0.66. This indicates that the model is better at identifying and classifying positive reviews compared to negative ones. For neutral sentiments, the model struggles to recognize them, achieving only an F1-score of 0.20. The tree’s depth of 937 suggests that the model is quite complex, involving multiple decision nodes to classify the data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t003 To improve the performance of the Decision Trees model, fine-tuning was conducted by adjusting the key parameter, max_depth, to explore different values. Max Depth refers to the maximum number of splits allowed in a Decision Trees and determines how deep the tree can grow, with each level representing a decision based on a feature in the dataset. During fine-tuning, it was observed that the model’s performance did not improve significantly as demonstrated in Table 4 and Table 5. After running cross-validation for each max_depth value, a maximum depth of 600 yielded an average accuracy of 77.31%. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t005 The Naive Bayes model is known for its high speed and efficiency in text classification tasks. As shown in Table 6, it achieved an average accuracy of 78.01%, which is comparable to the Decision Trees model’s performance. The Naive Bayes model outperforms the Decision Trees model in terms of recall for positive sentiments, achieving a high recall rate of 0.99. This means that Naive Bayes is highly effective at identifying positive reviews. However, its precision is lower than that of the Decision Trees model, standing at 0.78. This indicates that while Naive Bayes is particularly good at detecting positive sentiments, it is less accurate in ensuring that all detected positive reviews are genuinely positive. Conversely, the Naive Bayes model struggles significantly with neutral sentiments, scoring zero across all evaluation metrics for this category. This suggests that the model fails to identify or predict neutral reviews, which might be attributed to factors such as dataset imbalance, insufficient representation of neutral sentiments, or the model’s inability to distinguish neutral reviews effectively. On the other hand, the model performs well with negative sentiments, showing a high precision of 0.88, meaning it correctly identifies negative reviews 88% of the time. Nonetheless, its recall for negative sentiments is only 0.47, indicating that it captures just 47% of all actual negative reviews. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t006 To further enhance the performance of the Naive Bayes model, fine-tuning was performed by adjusting the key parameter, alpha. In Naive Bayes models, alpha is a smoothing parameter used to handle zero probabilities in the estimation of probabilities for unseen words in the training data. After fine-tuning, the model’s accuracy improved to 82.69%, outperforming the previous version with a smaller alpha value of 0.05. With a smaller alpha, the model is less likely to assume that all words occur with a uniform probability. As a result, the recall for negative sentiments improved significantly from 0.47 to 0.71, indicating a better ability to correctly identify negative reviews. Additionally, the F1 score for neutral sentiments also saw a slight improvement, reflecting some progress in predicting neutral reviews. Table 7 presents the results of the Naive Bayes model after fine-tuning. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t007 For classification tasks, logistic regression is a supervised ML algorithm designed to predict the likelihood that a given instance belongs to a specific class. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 85.05%, making it the best-performing model so far. Based on Table 8, it performs very well on positive sentiments, with f1-score of 0.92, and 0.78 on negative sentiments. Nonetheless, the model struggles with neutral sentiments, achieving only 26% precision, 2% recall, and a 4% F1-score. This low performance could be due to the limited number of neutral sentiment instances, meaning the model may not have enough examples to learn from. Additionally, logistic regression might be better at distinguishing between obvious different classes (positive vs. negative) and struggle with the minor distinctions required for neutral sentiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t008 To improve the performance of the logistic regression model, fine-tuning was conducted by adjusting several parameters. Specifically, a range of values for the regularization strength parameter C was explored, which governs the trade-off between achieving a good fit on the training data and maintaining smaller model coefficients. Additionally, different solvers (sag, lbfgs, and saga) were assessed to determine the optimization algorithm used, and various settings for the max_iter parameter were examined, which specifies the maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver to converge. Although these adjustments were made, the enhanced logistic regression model did not improve significantly with accuracy of 85.07% as shown in Table 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t009 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised ML algorithm that works by finding the optimal boundary that best separates different classes. Table 10 and Table 11 present the detailed results of the SVM model, including its performance after fine-tuning. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 85.02%, which is comparable to the logistic regression model. Like the logistic regression model, the SVM performs well in classifying positive sentiments, with an impressive F1-score of 0.92, and negative sentiments, with an F1-score of 0.78. The model also struggles with neutral sentiments, showing only 33% precision and 2% recall. This indicates the model correctly identifies only 2% of all actual neutral reviews, and one-third of the predictions it makes for neutral reviews are accurate. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t011 To further enhance the performance of the SVM model, we fine-tuned it by adjusting the regularization parameter C and setting the kernel to ‘linear’. Specifically, we increased the regularization parameter (C) to 10 to evaluate its effect on model performance. A higher C value in SVM typically signifies a greater emphasis on minimizing classification errors on the training set, potentially leading to improved model accuracy. Despite these adjustments, the tuned SVM model yielded an accuracy of 83.27%, which is slightly lower than the previous version. However, the larger C model shows a slight improvement in neutral sentiment detection, but overall performance remains low. In summary, while increasing C slightly improves the detection of neutral sentiments, it results in a decrease in overall accuracy, suggesting a potential overfitting to the training data. A CNN was employed to perform sentiment analysis and achieved an accuracy of 85.07%. The CNN model was initially set to train for 20 epochs but stopped early at the 7th epoch due to the Early Stopping criterion. Early Stopping was configured with a patience of 3 epochs, meaning the training would halt if no improvement in validation loss was observed for three consecutive epochs. The relatively small number of trainable parameters in the CNN architecture and the structured nature of the dataset contributed to rapid convergence. By the final epoch, the training accuracy reached 93.13%, while the validation accuracy had peaked earlier at 85.72% during the second epoch, indicating potential overfitting. Although the number of epochs completed was low, this was driven by clear validation trends suggesting that further training would not yield improved generalization. To enhance the performance, the fine-tuned CNN model included additional layers compared to the initial model. Firstly, a SpatialDropout1D layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 was added after the embedding layer to reduce overfitting. Then, two Conv1D layers were included: the first with 128 filters and the second with 64 filters, both with a kernel size of 5 and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation. Each Conv1D layer was followed by a MaxPooling1D layer and a Dropout layer with a 0.5 dropout rate to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the fine-tuned model included an extra Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation, followed by another Dropout layer, before the final Dense layer with 128 units and the output layer. These modifications aimed to enhance the model’s ability to capture complex patterns in the data and improve generalization. Fig 14 suggests that during the initial epochs, training accuracy steadily increases while training loss decreases, demonstrating effective learning. However, starting from Epoch 2, the validation loss begins to rise, and validation accuracy starts to decline, indicating overfitting. This trend suggests that the model becomes increasingly specialized to the training data and loses generalization capability on the validation set. Compared to the previous model, the fine-tuned CNN model achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 84.51%. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g014 When evaluated on the test set, the RNN model achieved an accuracy of 84.56%, which is comparable to the CNN model. While the RNN showed improvement in accuracy over epochs during training, the trends displayed in Fig 15 reveal signs of early instability and eventual overfitting. From Epochs 0–3, both training and validation accuracy fluctuate noticeably, suggesting that the model struggled to generalize consistently during the early stages of training. A significant gain in performance is observed from Epoch 4 onward, culminating in peak validation accuracy around Epochs 6 and 7. However, validation accuracy begins to decline slightly after Epoch 8, even as training accuracy continues to rise, indicating that the model starts to overfit to the training data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g015 To further improve the model, an enhanced RNN configuration was implemented by introducing an additional LSTM layer with 100 units. This LSTM layer was paired with dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.3 to reduce overfitting. The additional layer helped capture more complex sequential dependencies in the input text. This was followed by a Dense layer with 128 units and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation to extract additional features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. As shown in the training plots, training and validation loss both decline steadily up to Epoch 6. After this point, training loss continues to drop, while validation loss begins to plateau and slightly increase from Epoch 8 onward. Similarly, training accuracy steadily increases across all epochs, but validation accuracy peaks around Epochs 7–8 and shows a slight decline afterward. These trends clearly indicate that while the model initially generalizes well, overfitting begins to emerge in the later epochs. The enhanced RNN model achieved a slightly improved accuracy of 85.01% on the test set, reflecting marginal but consistent gains over the baseline. The graphs indicate early instability followed by convergence and later-stage overfitting, as shown by the divergence between training and validation metrics after Epoch 8. The performance instability observed in the RNN model, particularly during the early and late training epochs, may be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameter settings or the model’s architectural complexity relative to the dataset. Although dropout techniques were employed to mitigate overfitting, the model’s generalization capacity appeared limited after a certain point in training. Further optimization, such as adjusting learning rates, increasing data volume, or exploring simplified architectures, may enhance performance stability in future work. To further improve the model, an enhanced RNN model was designed by adding an additional LSTM layer with 100 units. This layer is paired with dropout and recurrent dropout rates of 0.3 to help prevent overfitting. The addition of the extra LSTM layer allows the model to further capture more complex patterns and relationships within the data. Following the LSTM layers, the model includes a Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation to extract further features, and a final Dense layer with SoftMax activation for three-class sentiment classification. Initially, the model shows steady improvements, with both accuracy and loss trending positively as shown in Fig 16. Nevertheless, from Epochs 1–3, there is some fluctuation in the validation metrics, indicating instability in the learning process. A notable improvement occurs after Epoch 4, where validation accuracy increases significantly. Yet, after Epoch 9, the validation metrics begin to decline slightly, suggesting potential overfitting as the model continues to improve on the training set but shows less progress on the validation set. This indicates that the model’s generalization capacity may be nearing its limit, with the best performance observed around Epoch 8. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.01% on the test set, showing only a slight improvement over the previous RNN model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g016 The initial LSTM model’s training performance shows an improvement over epochs, though with some fluctuations. According to Fig 17, the model’s accuracy gradually increases as the loss decreases from Epoch 1 to Epoch 4, reflecting a positive learning curve. A significant improvement occurs around Epoch 5, where the model’s accuracy increases, especially in validation accuracy, which increase from 70% to 85%. This trend continues as the model reaches its peak performance in Epoch 7, where the validation accuracy stabilizes around 85.97%. Conversely, in subsequent epochs, the model’s performance starts to drop, with minor increases in accuracy and slight increases in validation loss, indicating potential overfitting. The final accuracy achieved on the test set is 85.04%, which suggests the model is may have limited further improvement beyond this point. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g017 The enhanced LSTM model uses a slightly reduced learning rate (0.0005), which appears to stabilize the learning process more effectively. Validation accuracy and loss metrics demonstrate a more consistent improvement across epochs as presented in Fig 18. The validation accuracy continues to improve up to Epoch 16 before showing signs of minor fluctuations, while the first model started showing signs of overfitting by Epoch 9. Both models ultimately achieve similar final test accuracies of 85%. Yet, the second model achieves this through a more stable learning process, suggesting potentially better generalization to unseen data, even though the improvement in accuracy is minimal. In summary, the enhanced LSTM model shows improvements in training stability, overfitting control, and consistent performance across epochs. Although both models achieve similar final accuracies, the second model’s training process suggests a better-tuned model with improved learning dynamics. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g018 To compare the performance of various models on a sentiment classification task, the overall accuracy of each model is provided in Table 12 below. These accuracy scores provide a straightforward measure of how well each model performs in correctly classifying sentiment across a large dataset. Following the accuracy comparison, Table 13 and Table 14 offer a more granular analysis by presenting key performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and support for each sentiment class (negative, neutral, and positive). These tables provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, not just in terms of overall accuracy, but in their ability to manage the nuances of sentiment classification across various categories. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t014 When examining the accuracy scores, the Logistic Regression and CNN models achieved the highest overall accuracy at 85.07%, slightly outperforming LSTM (85.05%), and SVM (85.02%). Although the differences in accuracy are relatively small, these results indicate that even slight variations in model architecture or algorithm choice can impact performance in sentiment analysis tasks. The comparative performance of traditional classification models, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM across different sentiment classes highlights significant differences in effectiveness. For negative sentiments, both Logistic Regression and SVM demonstrate impressive performance, each achieving an F1 Score of 0.78. The Decision Trees model, however, shows more modest performance with an F1 Score of 0.66. Regarding neutral sentiments, the Decision Trees model performs best among the models with an F1 Score of 0.20, but this reflects a limitation in capturing neutral sentiments effectively, as it recalls only 17% of these cases. The other models perform even worse, particularly in terms of recall, with values falling below 0.05. This underscores the difficulty all models face in accurately classifying neutral sentiments. In summary, Logistic Regression and SVM are particularly effective for classifying both positive and negative sentiments, while they struggle with neutral sentiments. The Decision Trees model performs slightly better on neutral sentiments compared to others but is still limited. The overall effectiveness of Logistic Regression and SVM makes them more robust for handling sentiment classification, although the underrepresentation of neutral sentiments in the training data likely contributes to the models’ struggles with accurately identifying and classifying these less frequent cases. The evaluation of DL models including CNN, RNN, and LSTM models reveals performance characteristics across the sentiment categories of negative, neutral, and positive. For negative sentiment classification, all models exhibit good performance, with an average F1 Score of 0.77. For positive sentiment classification, all three models perform strongly. The CNN model achieves an F1 Score of 0.92, with high precision of 0.90 and recall of 0.94. The RNN model follows closely with an F1 Score of 0.91, precision of 0.89, and recall of 0.94. The LSTM model also performs well, reaching an F1 Score of 0.92 with a precision of 0.88 and recall of 0.96. In contrast, classifying neutral sentiments remains challenging for all models. Each model reports extremely low scores across precision, recall, and F1 Score for this category. The CNN model shows a slightly better performance with a precision of 0.41 and recall of 0.02, but these figures remain notably low. The RNN model performs worse with a precision of 0.30 and recall of 0.01, while the LSTM model struggles significantly, with all metrics at zero. This poor performance in identifying neutral sentiments is likely due to the imbalanced representation of neutral sentiments in the dataset, which provides insufficient context for the models to learn and generalize effectively. Based on the provided results, the CNN and LSTM Model are the best models due to their strong performance across positive and negative sentiments. Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy but is not the best in all sentiment-specific metrics compared to CNN and LSTM. For neutral sentiment classification, all models are faced with challenges. If overall accuracy and balanced performance across sentiment categories are prioritized, the CNN Model might be preferred due to high F1 Scores in both positive and negative sentiments. The LSTM Model is also a strong candidate as it able to capture positive sentiment with high recall. To evaluate whether the observed accuracy differences are statistically meaningful, a paired t-test was applied to the five-fold cross-validation accuracies of the CNN against each baseline model. Table 15 reports the resulting p-values (df = 4). A threshold of 0.05 was used to determine significance. The CNN outperforms Decision Trees and Naïve Bayes with statistically significant margins, while its advantage over Logistic Regression, SVM, RNN, and LSTM is not significant at the 0.05 level. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.t015 These results support the descriptive metrics in Table 12: although CNN shares similar mean accuracy with Logistic Regression and LSTM, its superiority is statistically confirmed only over the lower-performing traditional models. Consequently, conclusions about model ranking should emphasise practical as well as statistical considerations. After classification, the identification of main subjects within the Amazon customer review dataset is facilitated through the utilization of two topic detection algorithms: LDA and NMF. The purpose of this is to reveal the main topics people are talking about in the Amazon customer review dataset. The LDA model was employed to discover five primary topics for each brand within the Amazon customer reviews dataset. These topics are characterised by a distribution of words that summarise the key themes prevalent in the reviews. The main points include: By detecting these topics across different brands, the LDA model provides valuable insights into the aspects of phone performance that matter most to consumers. The topic explanations for each brand can be found in Table 1–10 of Appendix A in S1 File. After that, the NMF model was also employed to discover five primary topics for each brand within the Amazon customer reviews dataset. The key points identified by NMF model include: This explanation highlights that the NMF model captured not only performance-related aspects but also emotional themes. The topic explanations for each brand can be found in Tables 11–20 of Appendix B in S1 File. To provide an objective assessment of topic quality, we calculated the CS using the widely adopted c_v metric. Higher CS values indicate greater semantic similarity among the top words in a topic, resulting in more interpretable themes. The LDA model achieved a CS of 0.41, whereas the NMF model obtained a higher CS of 0.54. These quantitative results corroborate the qualitative findings in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, confirming that the NMF topics are more coherent and therefore better suited for analysing brand perception in this dataset. In evaluating the performance of these two topic-detection approaches, the NMF model emerges as the most effective for this study. NMF produces more focused, detailed, and interpretable topics, making it the strongest tool for understanding brand perceptions within customer reviews. The LDA model tends to capture topics that are closely related to phone features yet often overlapping. Themes such as “battery” and “camera” frequently intersect with broader topics like overall user satisfaction, limiting LDA’s ability to separate distinct aspects of user experience, especially in the smartphone domain, where multiple features influence perception simultaneously. By contrast, the NMF model delivers more precise and distinguishable topics. It not only identifies general themes like user satisfaction but also uncovers specific issues such as product condition upon arrival or mixed feedback on certain models (e.g., Asus Zenfone). NMF further highlights detailed topics such as camera performance and connectivity issues, each treated as a distinct subject with its own sentiment profile. This granularity enables deeper analysis of how customers perceive individual phone features. When NMF reveals, for instance, that camera performance is a significant concern for a brand, product development and marketing teams can address that issue directly. The clarity and specificity of NMF topics thus provide actionable insights, facilitating improved brand management and customer satisfaction. In conclusion, NMF proves to be the most effective topic-modelling technique for this study. Its capacity to extract distinct, focused topics and capture a wide range of user sentiments and product attributes makes it the preferred choice for understanding and analysing brand perception in customer reviews. By leveraging NMF, business owners gain a deeper and more actionable understanding of how customers perceive different aspects of their products, enabling more targeted improvements and more effective communication with consumers. After selecting the best topic detection model, brand sentiments were generated by applying the VADER sentiment analysis on the results. Sentiment scores help categorize customer opinions into positive, neutral, or negative, and provide a clear measure of consumer sentiment. The sentiment scores for each brand can be found in Table 21 of Appendix C in S1 File. Here is a summary of the sentiment scores for various smartphone brands: Overall, these sentiment analyses provide a comprehensive view of customer perceptions, enabling brands to address concerns. This information also can guide strategic decisions, such as enhancing product features that are well-received, addressing common complaints, or refining marketing messages to align with customer expectations. Following the sentiment analysis and topic detection, which offered a deeper understanding of the underlying themes and sentiments within the dataset, we now shift our focus to visualizing the broader aspects of the data. Visualization is essential for uncovering patterns, trends, and insights. This section presents a series of visualizations that offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset, employing both Python and Tableau for this purpose. Several graphs were created using Python to provide a detailed analysis of the dataset. These Python-generated graphs offer an initial exploration of the data. The top ten products with the most customer reviews are presented in Fig 19, allowing business owners to identify which products were customer favourites during this timeframe. Most of these products are from the Samsung brand, with only one product each from Xiaomi and Nokia. By knowing the popular brand among the smartphone users, a business owner can determine if a particular feature or product brand resonates more with consumers, enabling them to focus on those aspects in future inventory management and marketing strategies. Besides, Fig 20 plots the top three products for each brand, providing insights into the best-selling products for each brand. This information can help business owners understand which products are most popular among customers for each specific brand. For instance, a business owner can manage product inventory more effectively by deciding whether to stock up on popular items, reduce stock for less favoured ones, or import similar products with popular features. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g019 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g020 Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard was created in Tableau to compile and extend these insights as seen in Fig 21. The Tableau dashboard includes visualizations such as reviews over time, average ratings by brand, total reviews by brand, sentiment distribution across categories for each brand, and a summary of the top ten products by brand in terms of review count and average rating. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for gaining a comprehensive view of Amazon customer reviews across distinct brands, allowing for a deeper understanding of brand performance and customer perception. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334330.g021 In conclusion, this study addressed the challenge of extracting actionable insights from the extensive volume of customer reviews, particularly within the smartphone industry. By applying sentiment analysis techniques, topic detection, and an interactive Tableau dashboard, this research filled a gap in the literature on brand sentiment analysis for smartphone brands. The results showed that the CNN model, which achieved the highest accuracy at 85.07%, provided balanced performance across sentiment categories and proved to be particularly effective for overall sentiment analysis. Although Logistic Regression achieved similar accuracy, it fell short in comparison to CNN across sentiment-specific metrics. All models struggled with classifying neutral sentiments, which may be attributed to the less emotionally charged nature of these reviews. While early stopping and dropout were applied to address overfitting in the CNN model, we acknowledge that the observed gap between training and validation accuracy suggests room for further improvement. Due to the scope of the current study, additional regularization techniques such as L2 weight decay, batch normalization, and text augmentation were not explored. These strategies are being investigated in ongoing follow-up work aimed at enhancing model generalization and robustness. All DL models were capped at 20 global epochs to maintain parity of training time across the benchmark. While early stopping indicated convergence in most cases, this cap may have curtailed the models’ ability to extract deeper feature hierarchies. Ongoing work is experimenting with extended epoch schedules, cosine learning-rate decay, and warm-up strategies to determine whether additional training yields measurable gains in generalisation. Building on these findings, the research made significant contributions. Firstly, the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard enables businesses to monitor customer sentiment trends and brand perception effectively. This tool provides businesses with a comprehensive visual analysis of customer feedback, helping them to make data-driven decisions that enhance brand image and customer satisfaction. Secondly, this study proposed a new framework that applies sentiment analysis, topic detection and brand topic sentiments. This approach provides a holistic view of customer feedback, which is essential for businesses in the competitive smartphone market. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The dataset used only includes information up to 2019, which may not reflect the most recent trends or shifts in language usage. Additionally, challenges in text preprocessing, such as handling multilingual content and slang, may have impacted model performance. Future research should consider using real-time social media analytics, if possible, to capture more up-to-date customer feedback. The dataset also revealed a clear imbalance in sentiment labels. This imbalance posed a risk of model bias during classification. To mitigate this, class weighting was applied during model training, ensuring that minority classes contributed more significantly to the loss function. Preliminary experiments showed that weighted training improved the recall of Negative and Neutral classes by three to five percentage points compared with an unweighted baseline. Techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), data augmentation, or ensemble re-weighting were not employed in this study; future work could explore these alternatives to determine whether they further mitigate imbalance without introducing noise. In this study, we adopted a conventional 80/20 random train-test split to benchmark model performance, which allowed for a balanced distribution across sentiment categories. However, we recognise that this approach may not fully capture the complexities of real-world generalisation. The observed similarity in model performance could, in part, stem from the homogeneity introduced by this split strategy. As such, we acknowledge the value of more challenging evaluation frameworks. Future work will explore brand-wise, temporally stratified, and cross-platform data splits to better evaluate model robustness and generalisability across diverse product lines and evolving consumer contexts. Other sources of imbalance, such as the uneven temporal and brand distribution of reviews, were also not explicitly addressed. For example, some brands only appear in later years (e.g., Xiaomi), which may influence the model’s ability to generalize across brands and time periods. Future work could explore temporal resampling or brand-stratified evaluation to better account for these biases. Reviews were categorized using an automated Python-based heuristic labelling strategy, which relied in part on the VADER lexicon-based approach. While this facilitated efficient labelling of over 60,000 reviews, it may oversimplify sentiment classification, particularly for neutral or ambiguous cases. Lexicon-driven methods such as VADER are constrained by their dependence on pre-defined word lists and heuristics, which can struggle to capture contextual nuances, sarcasm, or domain-specific terminology. These limitations introduce potential ambiguity in the dataset and may affect model training and evaluation outcomes. Future iterations of this study may therefore explore more robust labelling methods, such as manually annotated datasets, semi-supervised learning approaches, or transformer-based sentiment labelling techniques, to improve contextual sensitivity and reliability. Due to computational constraints, hyperparameter tuning for CNN, RNN, and LSTM models was limited to a focused grid of empirically selected values. While this ensured fair benchmarking, we acknowledge that a broader search might have yielded better-optimised configurations. Each model was tuned via five-fold cross-validation, with the best settings selected based on mean validation accuracy. In future work, we aim to adopt more systematic tuning methods, such as Bayesian or random search, to explore a wider range of architectural and optimisation parameters and further improve model robustness. While the current pipeline relies on conventional ML and foundational DL architectures, recent advances in NLP demonstrate that richer text representations can be obtained through Word Embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe, and through Transformer-based LLM such as BERT, Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and GPT. These models capture context-dependent semantics, idiomatic expressions, and subtle sentiment cues that conventional bag-of-words and static embeddings may overlook. Future work will therefore integrate pre-trained contextual embeddings or fine-tuned transformer encoders into the sentiment-classification stage, benchmark their performance against the current CNN baseline, and evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost. While the present work focuses on Amazon smartphone reviews, we recognize that broader applicability requires careful consideration. The proposed pipeline is adaptable to other e-commerce platforms and consumer domains where reviews share structural similarities, such as hospitality, consumer electronics, and healthcare. However, differences in linguistic styles, platform-specific rating systems, and domain-specific terminology may limit direct transferability. To strengthen generalizability, future research should evaluate the framework across multiple datasets and platforms, potentially using domain adaptation or transfer learning techniques to account for variations in language and context. This would ensure that the approach remains robust and reliable when applied to diverse industries beyond the Amazon ecosystem. Beyond technical performance, this study also acknowledges the ethical implications of deploying automated sentiment analysis systems. Bias in training data, such as imbalanced sentiment classes, skewed brand representation, or culturally specific language, can propagate through the model and result in unfair or inaccurate predictions. For instance, reviews written in non-standard dialects or by speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds may be misclassified due to underrepresentation in the training set. Automated sentiment classifiers may also inadvertently amplify stereotypes or marginalize minority voices if not properly audited. To ensure responsible AI practices, future work should incorporate fairness evaluation metrics, conduct bias audits, and explore mitigation techniques such as adversarial debiasing or fairness-aware training. Transparency, accountability, and inclusivity should be core principles in the development and deployment of sentiment analysis models used for real-world decision-making. In conclusion, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of customer sentiment analysis and provides practical tools for businesses to improve their brand perception and customer satisfaction in the highly competitive smartphone market. At the same time, the ethical implications and challenges of generalizability must not be overlooked. By embedding fairness, transparency, and adaptability into future work, sentiment analysis frameworks can achieve both technical robustness and responsible application across diverse domains.

AI Stat Padding Google and Meta love bragging about how widely their AI tools are being used by consumers. But are those metrics legit? For example, Mark Zuckerberg noted during Meta’s quarterly earnings in October that “more than one billion monthly actives already use Meta AI.” Wow! Sounds like a lot. Usage has also increased, Zuckerberg added, as the underlying models improve. But guess what? The basic search function on Instagram was recently replaced by Meta AI, and the app’s entire user base now defaults to that experience even if someone doesn’t want to use the feature. Meanwhile, Google is funneling people to its AI Mode for search regardless of their search engine preferences. As noted by Search Engine Roundtable, anyone who uploads a photo or document to Google is now sent to AI Mode by default instead of a traditional Google Search or Image Search. Meanwhile, in September, Google quietly began sliding a button into the Chrome URL address bar that directs queries straight into AI Mode rather than traditional search. The Defrayed Desk It’s been knives out for The Trade Desk’s 20% take rate all year. And now the largest independent DSP actually appears open to cutting its own fees. Although The Trade Desk historically has been inflexible in pricing negotiations, it’s offering agency discounts and incentives this Q4, Digiday reports. What’s changed? Mainly, increased competition from other top DSPs, Amazon in particular. Amazon DSP has been courting agencies with 0% tech fees for Amazon-owned media and 1% fees for third-party ads. Plus, TTD is under pressure to meet or exceed expectations this Q4, after missing its fourth quarter 2024 revenue guidance earlier this year. One indie agency buyer says TTD offered 1% to 2% discounts on ad tech fees for individual clients – if the agency committed to spending $500,000 more in Q4 than originally budgeted. Another buyer says they were offered post-auction discounts if they spent at least $750,000 in Q4. At the holding company level, one buyer says, TTD is making its development team available for working on tailored programmatic solutions free of charge. Another observes that TTD’s account reps are more responsive lately. All told, evidence is accumulating of an increasingly cutthroat DSP market. Open Up The Elsagates Good news: YouTube has finally found a reliable audience for the AI-generated content that’s been flooding the platform. Bad news: It’s toddlers (again). YouTube creators are increasingly monetizing by generating generic, low-quality AI slop videos intended for children, reports Bloomberg. The trend is particularly popular among entrepreneur-focused creators that make content about making money on YouTube, such as Monique Hinton and Isabella Kotsias. Both have posted videos specifically advocating that their viewers attempt to copy popular YouTube Kids trends and products, like “Baby Shark” and “Cocomelon.” This might trigger alarm bells for those who remember 2017’s Elsagate, a YouTube epoch marked by nonsensical videos of popular children’s characters (mostly Spider-Man and Elsa from “Frozen”) engaging in strange or disturbing activities. This “luridly-colored vomit,” as Forbes called it at the time, became enough of a problem that YouTube changed its community guidelines, purged thousands of videos and removed monetizable ads from millions more.

December 03, 2025 17:29 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to report shallow, high-grade confirmatory grade control drill results from the P17 Zone at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The P17 Zone is a high-grade hard rock deposit outcropping at surface located at the southern end of the Bomboré mining lease. In addition to several phased oxide pits, which have locally been advanced into the hard rock, the P17 Zone will be a primary mill feed source in 2026 for the new hard rock plant, currently being commissioned. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “The results of the near-surface P17 Zone grade control drill program were successful in confirming the P17 resource and reserve models. Furthermore, the results serve to underscore the high-grade nature and overall continuity of mineralization within the P17 Zone. This initial grade control drill program is centered on the first six months of planned production from the P17 Zone. Mining activities in this area of the pit are now underway, with mined ore scheduled to be fed to the mill in early 2026 once commissioning is complete. ___________________________________1. True widths of mineralization are between 75-80% of drilled lengths. Commissioning of the stage 1 hard rock plant is well advanced, with the jaw crusher now commissioned and a crushed ore stockpile established. The SAG mill is now turning, with grinding media being added and first ore through the mill expected to follow very soon. Water testing of the CIL circuit is now complete, with the tanks to be filled and fresh carbon to be added by the end of the week. Overall, commissioning activities remain on schedule, with first gold expected in the coming days. This is truly an exciting time for the Company, and I want to thank everyone involved for all their hard work and dedication. The commencement of production from the stage 1 hard rock plant represents a major milestone for Orezone, with overall gold production at Bomboré set to increase by 45% to 170,000 to 185,000oz in 2026. This will mark a significant cash flow inflection point, underscored by the Company’s solid balance sheet and record high gold prices.” Figure 1: Stage 1 Hard Rock Expansion Commissioning Figure 2: Bomboré Plan Map – Highlighting Location of P17 Grade Control Drilling and Associated Sections Figure 3: P17 Composite Long Section – Highlighting Location of Grade Control Cross Sections and Further Exploration Upside Down Plunge of US$1,740/oz Pit Shell (Looking West) Figure 4: P17 Grade Control Cross Section A-A’ (Looking North) Figure 5: P17 Grade Control Cross Section B-B’ (Looking North) Table 1: P17 Grade Control Drill Results * Mineralized intervals are reported as downhole lengths.

Title: This Meta Quest 3 charging dock won't stop beeping at me, but damn does it keep my VR setup neat and tidy

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The PrismXR charging dock is certainly one of the neatest stands for the Quest 3 you'll find on the shelves. It keeps things low-profile, charges the headset and its controllers, and doesn't take up much room on a shelf or desk. But there are some definite annoyances that prevent this from being an easy recommendation. Charges the controllers and the headset Supplies rechargeable batteries for the controllers Neat, tidy look while on display Handy indicator LEDs to show how much each element is charged Compatible with headstraps from other brands Annoying, incessant beeping Doesn't seem to turn itself off when the headset is fully charged Separate version for the Quest 3S -Not the fastest method of charging Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Pretty soon after setting up my Quest 3, I realised how quickly the controllers lose battery. In fact, even if I didn't use them or the headset for a week or two, I'd frequently come back to find them completely drained. Having only used a charging stand that gave power to the headset itself, I knew my budget for batteries would thank me if I tried something that charged the controllers too. So, to the best Meta Quest accessories I turned, and of all the available charging stands, PrismXR's filled the most gaps in the market for me. It charges the headset and the controllers, but also feels perfect for anyone who wants a pretty low-profile way of displaying their VR loadout. It doesn't have fancy RGB or stand too high for a lot of shelfing units, and its aesthetic matches the Quest 3's as though it was made by Meta itself. For $69.99 / £69.99, it's roughly on par with the cost of most other charging docks, so let's see how it performs. Having just reviewed the PrismXR charging belt for Quest 3 and 3S, I had high hopes for this dock as a follow-up. Just like the charging belt, this is fairly self-explanatory. The Carina D1 is a dock that you can plug in via USB-C that'll magnetically charge your headset and controllers. Rather annoyingly, because this was designed with the Meta Quest 3 in mind before the 3S arrived on the scene, it has a fairly snug design that's bespoke for the original VR headset. For that reason, you'll need to opt for a separate version of this device for the Quest 3S, which leaves the door open for wrong purchases, but does help to create a neater match with whichever headset you own. From a quick search of both charging docks on Amazon and at PrismXR's own website, they seem to do the exact same thing, and for the most part, are the same price. That said, I'd think about looking into the price history of either at your own leisure because, like any and all Quest 3 accessories, their prices fluctuate madly. To keep the controllers charged, the D1 dock comes with rechargeable batteries, as well as different grip plates for your controllers so that they can attach magnetically. These feel exactly the same as the stock ones when using the controllers during VR play, and only take a minute to swap out. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Magnetics are the name of the game here, as magnetic charging pins are used to connect the bottom of the headset to the charging dock. For the overall aesthetic of the Carina D1, this helps to keep things nice and neat - there are no cables to be seen from the front. Perhaps my favorite thing about the dock's design is that it has a handy head strap pedestal at the back, which allows for more compatibility with third-party accessories. I was worried my KIWI Design Comfort Battery Strap wouldn't fit, but thanks to this handy add-on, I had no problems. In terms of technicals, the Carina D1 Charging Dock can Fast Charge up to 27W, which PrismXR says will take your Quest 3 from 0% to 50% in 45 minutes, and fully charge in 1hr50. The controllers have a quoted charging time of 2hr30. There are also some handy LED indicators on the front of the stand that tell you what level of battery the headset and two controllers are, and as I'll come on to, there are audible indicating bleeps too. I really like the look of the PrismXR charging dock. Its nest design means I was spoiled for choice for where to put it in my living space. It could fit in one of the shelves in my cube unit because it isn't too tall. It's not obnoxiously wide, so it can sit nicely with the other gaming hardware on my desk or a shelf. But at the same time, it still looks neat and tidy, and its white design lines up exactly with the color of the headset. The only real test of this dock, besides its looks, is how it charges the headset and controllers. If I'm honest, I'd like it to be a bit quicker, but that's mainly because I'm used to plugging it in at the wall with a super-fast charger and seeing it juice up pretty speedily. Arguably, for a charging stand, I don't think it necessarily needs to be super quick because it's where you put it when you know it'll be sitting to rest between sessions. Still, I found it took around an hour to charge the headset up to its 50% mark while the controllers were also connected - which I suppose matches up with the quoted 45-minute mark that I'll assume refers to just the headset being connected. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into At least the indicating LEDs are a handy way to keep tabs on charging progress. What isn't so handy is a very loud beeping tone that the D1 will pierce your eardrums with. When you first connect the headset and controllers, it'll beep. When it finishes charging them? It'll beep, and sometimes, keep beeping. I've seen reports of these bleeps being buggy and incessant for multiple users. Certainly, the first time I used the D1, that's the experience I had when my headset reached full charge. Other reports seem to suggest that the beeping is due to a faulty connection, which would line up with my experience of other times when the headset reached full charge, then didn't beep at all. Either way, these beeps are loud and a very annoying point of convenience-gone-wrong if they continually bug out for people. What's more unclear is whether or not the dock can turn itself off when the Quest 3 reaches full charge, because if not, it could cause you battery life issues further down the road. Unless you go and unplug the dock entirely or remove the headset so the magnetic pins aren't connected, it could keep charging your headset, or, in my case, beeping loudly. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into, but since this is a known issue for other users who have had larger connection problems, it's all a little unclear. Considering this brand's charging belt will turn itself off when it detects a fully charged headset, it's a bit of a shame that the charging dock isn't more upfront that it will do so as well. If you touch the LEDs, they'll go to sleep, but I'm not sure whether that actually turns the charging power off. Thankfully, I've found that my headset will still sit fine on the dock when it's just out of place enough that the pins aren't touching. This isn't ideal though, and goes against the snug aesthetic the charging stand is going for. Irritating beeping aside, I do think this charging stand is one of the better and more versatile ones available for the Quest 3. PrismXR has made something that's well designed and caters to a large cross-section of VR gamers who have lots of storage needs and headstraps already integrated into their setups. It's a shame that the charging isn't quicker, and there's definite friction with those indicating bleeps - which seem to be the most frequently reported issue in most customer reviews. Regardless, this is a charging stand I'll be keeping in my loadout, mainly thanks to its convenience of charging the headset along with its controllers, which can prove tricky otherwise. I integrated the PrismXR Carina D1 Charging Dock into my gaming setup for a number of weeks before this review was written. Since receiving the testing sample from PrismXR, it's been my main method of charging my VR headset and controllers. To put it to the test, I set a timer on how long it took to charge the headset in various scenarios: when it was at 0%, when it was at 50% going to 100%, and a full charge. I compared my experience to my time spent with other Quest 3 accessories. For more on how we test the latest gadgets, check out the GamesRadar+ hardware policy. Happy with flat screen games for now?
