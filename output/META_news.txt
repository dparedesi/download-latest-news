Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has recently sold a portion of his holdings in the company. The transaction, which took place on September 23, involved the sale of 10,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $569.93 per share, amounting to a total of over $5.6 million. This sale was conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of trading on nonpublic information. The shares sold by Cox were held by the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust, for which he is the trustee. Following the sale, Cox's trust still retains a significant stake in the company, with 328,662 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A common stock remaining. Additionally, Cox is associated with the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider sales as they may provide insights into executives' views on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it is important to note that such transactions do not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company; they may be part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specifically within the computer programming and data processing industry. The company has made significant strides in recent years to expand its offerings beyond social media, delving into areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The sale by Cox was officially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, with Erin Guldiken signing as attorney-in-fact for Christopher K. Cox. As insiders' transactions are publicly disclosed, investors have the opportunity to stay informed about the financial moves of Meta Platforms' top executives. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has been actively showcasing its advancements in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The company's annual Connect conference highlighted the development of its first AR glasses, and an update to its AI chatbot feature that now allows users to select a voice of their choice. Despite technical challenges, Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and AR technologies, with projected capital expenses for 2024 estimated to be between $37 billion to $40 billion. Simultaneously, Meta has decided to hold off on joining the European Union's AI Pact, focusing instead on complying with the upcoming EU's Artificial Intelligence Act. The Act, set to be implemented by August 2, 2026, will require companies to provide detailed accounts of the data used to train their AI models. In the financial realm, both Roth Capital and BofA Securities have provided positive outlooks on Meta's shares. Roth Capital highlighted a steady increase in the company's cost per thousand impressions, a key indicator of robust advertising demand. BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating for Meta, anticipating the launch of advanced AI chat options and new AI capabilities for WhatsApp and Messenger. In its push towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits in a deal with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm, marking the company's most significant carbon removal procurement from a single project to date. This is part of Meta's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Lastly, Meta along with other tech giants is engaged with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act. The companies are participating in the drafting of the codes of practice for the new legislation, expected to be finalized by late next year. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms Inc. Amidst the news of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, selling a portion of his holdings, current and potential investors may find it beneficial to consider additional metrics and tips from InvestingPro.

Title: Meta Unveils Budget-Friendly Quest 3S Headset for the VR Curious

Mark Zuckerberg is trying once again to bring VR to the masses, this time through a new Quest 3S headset that arrives next month starting at $299. The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499.

Title: Google paid $2.7B to rehire AI genius who left after company refused to release his bot: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/business/google-paid-2-7b-to-rehire-ai-genius-who-left-for-startup/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T18:29:46Z
Full Content:
Google paid $2.7 billion to rehire an artificial intelligence genius who left the tech giant in a huff three years ago to found his own startup, according to a report. Noam Shazeer, a 48-year-old software engineer who was first hired by Google as one of its first few hundred employees back in 2000, left the company in 2021 after it refused his request to release a chat bot that he had developed with a colleague, Daniel De Freitas. Shazeer and De Freitas went on to found Character.AI, which grew to become one of the hottest AI startups in Silicon Valley that would eventually reach a $1 billion valuation last year. Last month, Google and Character.AI announced that Shazeer, De Freitas and certain members of Character.AI’s research team would be joining Google’s AI unit DeepMind. At the time of the deal, Character.AI said that it had more than 20 million monthly active users. Google paid Character.AI $2.7 billion to license its technology as well as to get Shazeer and his team to agree to work for the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The licensing deal, which is short of a full-fledged acquisition, is a unique arrangement that allows Google to immediately access Character.AI’s intellectual property without having to wait for the regulatory approvals and bureaucratic sign-offs that would have been required if the company was bought outright. Shazeer’s return to Google is widely viewed among company employees as the primary reason behind the acquisition of Character.AI, the Journal reported. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was reportedly impressed with Shazeer — so much so that he was convinced he would be able to build an AI model that could operate with human-level intelligence, according to the Journal. “If there’s anybody I can think of in the world who’s likely to do it, it’s going to be him,” Schmidt was quoted as saying of Shazeer during a talk at Stanford University in 2015. In 2017, Shazeer and another Google colleague, De Freitas, teamed up to create Meena, a chat bot that could engage humans on a range of issues. According to the Journal, Shazeer was so confident of Meena’s utility that he predicted it would one day replace Google’s search engine. But Google executives thought it was too risky to release Meena due to concerns about safety and fairness, the Journal reported. Google tapped Shazeer, who netted hundreds of millions of dollars in the transaction, to be one of three people who will lead the company’s efforts to build the next version of Gemini, Google’s next-generation AI model that was built to compete with rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Google temporarily suspended Gemini’s image-generating feature after it produced inaccurate “woke” depictions such as minority founding father and diverse popes.

Last month, Google lifted the suspension and allowed users to create images using prompts after fixing the bugs. The steep price that Google paid to bring Shazeer and De Freitas back into the fold is indicative of the expensive race among Silicon Valley tech giants to hire the best talent during the AI era — particularly in the wake of OpenAI’s rollout of ChatGPT. The talent wars have heated up to the point where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founder Sergey Brin personally wrote notes to recruits urging them to come aboard. Brin is reportedly the key figure in helping to persuade Shazeer to return to Google, according to the Journal. Companies like OpenAI pay prized recruits compensation packages ranging from $5 million to $10 million — mostly in the form of stock. Meta has developed a reputation for being somewhat stingy, offering pay packages of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data unearthed by the tech-centric news site The Information.

Title: Meta will stop selling the Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year

Meta just revealed the budget-friendly Quest 3S VR headset at its annual Connect keynote event, but it also made a sad announcement about some of its previous headsets. The company will stop selling both the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro by the end of the year. “With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” the company wrote in a blog post that also announced the pending launch of the Quest 3S. The company will be selling Quest 2 and Pro accessories for “a bit longer” after the stock of headsets runs out. This includes the carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers and bundles like the Quest 2 Active Pack. Meta recently lowered the price of the Quest 2 to $200, and it’s still a decent headset for beginners. The Quest 3S is better in every way, but it starts at $300, while the standard Quest 3 costs $500. It’s the end of an era for the Quest 2. This was a hugely successful headset, as it launched during the dog days of COVID-19. For many, it became a crucial item to survive endless isolation, along with stuff like Zoom and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It’s the end of an error (see what I did there?) for the Quest Pro. This headset never caught on, likely because it was originally priced at $1,500 before being quickly lowered to $1,000. It still costs a grand from Meta, but can typically be found for around $900 via Amazon and other retailers. As they say, out with the old and in with the new. The Quest 3S is, essentially, the new Quest 2. It starts at $300, boasts the same CPU as the original Quest 3 and handles full-color passthrough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Meta Quest 3S is Meta's new budget-friendly standalone VR headset, and you can preorder now ahead of its October 15 release. By Steven Petite on September 26, 2024 at 3:57PM PDT Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $300 Meta Quest 3S (256GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $400 Meta Quest 3 (512GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $500 The newly announced Meta Quest 3S has a pretty awesome launch bundle that makes the already budget-friendly headset more enticing. From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, ahead of the headset's October 15 release date. Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3. Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision. Meta also significantly reduced the price of the regular 512GB Quest 3, which is eligible for the same bundle offer, and discontinued the 128GB Quest 3 (now on clearance for $430). Meta Quest 3 VR headset options: Check out the new Meta Quest 3S bundles below: The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives. The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year. Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments. You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on. At the moment, buying the headset and Elite Strap separately costs the same price as the bundle at Amazon. The 256GB Meta Quest 3S is available to preorder for $400 at Amazon. Like the 128GB version, you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta+. Amazon has the Quest 3S 256GB bundle with the Elite Strap included for $465.73. If you want to play Batman: Arkham Shadow but would rather opt for the more powerful Meta Quest 3, the same bundle is available to purchase now at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3 Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle costs $500, which sounds like quite the deal considering the price of the 512GB Quest 3 up until now. Meta revealed the bundle alongside a price drop for the Quest 3. The 512GB model previously cost $650 and will now go for $500. The 128GB model is being discontinued, but remaining stock will be sold for $430 (was $500). As a result of its discontinuation, the 128GB Quest 3 will not be available in the new Batman bundle, but you can buy the headset now for $429 at Walmart.

Title: I tried out Meta's Orion computer glasses. I'd buy them in a heartbeat — if they were actually for sale.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/orion-meta-ar-smart-glasses-review-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:50:17Z
Full Content:
Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here is what you need to know about Orion, the new computer-on-your-face nerd glasses Mark Zuckerberg showed off today: Each pair of glasses reportedly costs Meta $10,000 to make, and the company says it needs time to get them to a price that makes them plausible — think something in the $1,000-ish range, like a laptop or high-end phone. (That $10,000 number comes from The Verge's Alex Heath. Meta declined to comment on the number). If all goes well, it could take a few years for that to happen. 2. I've tried them, and they are very cool! They don't make you look cool — you look like someone wearing tech on your face — but the ideas and engineering behind them are really fascinating. If you're one of the people who complains that Silicon Valley hasn't made anything except soul-sucking social networks and monetization machines for years, here's a compelling counter. More important: Unlike other face-computing tech I've tried over the years — Google's Glass, Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's own line of Quest goggles — this is one I can actually imagine buying, and using, in real life. My brief experience with Orion comes with major caveats. The biggest is that it's not actually ready for mass production. But if this pans out, it will deliver what lots of people in tech, and outside tech, say they want: a wearable computer jammed into a pair of glasses. What would you do with a wearable computer? For starters, lots of things you can do with a phone: Take and make phone calls and video calls. Send and receive texts. Take photos and videos. Watch videos. Play time-wasting games. Play around with AI. And because Orion sits on your face like glasses — bulky glasses that use silicon carbide instead of glass — you can do all those things while looking at, and interacting with, everything and everyone around you. This is "augmented reality" — digital images laid over the real world. As opposed to "virtual reality" — where you are totally enveloped by a digital landscape. There are obvious downsides to this. If you think it's frustrating to talk to someone who keeps looking at their phone to check a text or a viral video, imagine what it will be like to hold a conversation with someone who's staring at you and staring at something else at the very same time.* But there are very intriguing upsides, too. Most obviously: Picture yourself with a task — like changing a tire, making marinara, or solving a math problem — and the ability to simultaneously look at the thing you want to do and instructions on how to do it. Orion uses eye tracking, which means you select digital items just by looking at them. And you manipulate them — turn an app on or off, respond to a text message, swipe through videos on Reels — by making subtle flicks and clicks with your fingers. Those gestures get registered by a snug-but-not-bulky wristband** that registers your muscles' movements using electromyography*** and transmits them wirelessly to your glasses. Orion also comes the closest I've seen to a face computer you could take for a stroll. Unlike other devices I've seen, it doesn't need to be plugged into a bulky power source or tethered to a phone. Instead, it connects wirelessly to a TV-remote-sized power/computing device you can slip into your pocket that connects to the internet via WiFi or cell signals. Meta says its battery will last for two to three hours of continual use. And here, I'm going to stop talking about Orion's specs. Because it seems pretty silly to get very deep into a thing that's still in development and may never actually materialize for mass production. It's also important to stress that my brief demo time was in a Meta building, surrounded by Meta employees who guided me through a Meta-scripted walk-through. I have no idea how, or if, this thing works in the real world. Neither do Meta executives, really. They say they're about to start "dogfooding" the device with lots of employees to get a better sense of how it performs while continuing to figure out how to make it lighter and cheaper. Which brings us to two questions about Zuckerberg's reveal this week. First: Why is Meta showing off something no one's going to be able to buy — at best — for years? This reminds me of pre-iPhone reveals, where it was common for tech companies to show you stuff they might make one day, but very often didn't. When I ask Meta executives that question, they murmur about wanting their fellow employees to see the work they're doing, and to be encouraged by the progress they're making. But surely there are other ways to pump up morale — like having a record-high stock price, which happens to have happened this week. My theory relates to that stock price: that Zuckerberg, who has gotten grief over the years for plowing billions into his metaverse dreams, wants to show the world — and specifically investors — that all those dollars weren't wasted. And that he's getting very close to a consumer device people might buy in very large numbers. Which brings us to my second question: Why does Meta, whose online ad business is one of the world's greatest money-printing machines, want to make hardware anyway? That one is easier to answer. Most practically: As great as that money-printing machine is, it can't work without phones made by Apple and Google — companies that force Meta to play by their rules and restrictions. If Orion, or any other device Meta makes, becomes the future of computing, then Zuckerberg can operate his business on his devices. But if you're into vibes-based answers: Orion's debut is part of the Mark Zuckerberg 3.0 era. One where he says he's done apologizing (even though he's still apologizing) and done with politics (even though politics is not done with him). One where he's trying new looks (including his own designs). So if he wants to take a victory lap with very cool new tech — even if the tech isn't quite ready for prime time? He's going to do that, too. *The entire time I played with Orion, I kept thinking about teenagers I see walking around with a single AirPod in their ear at all times. The idea, supposedly, is that they can keep listening to whatever they want while begrudgingly listening to you, too. I find that half-in, half-out way of interacting with the world incredibly frustrating. But I'm old. Your mileage may vary. **For whatever reason, some Meta people call this a "neural wristband," which makes it seem like it's somehow reading your brain. Thankfully, it is not. ***(I had never heard of this term before this week, either.) Jump to

Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Meta made the announcement today at Meta Connect 2024. It comes as the company officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, starting at $300, and announced that it's also discontinuing the 128GB Quest 3 after cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 model to $500. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: Quest 2 launched in 2020 with a remarkable proposition: a twice as powerful chipset and higher resolution than the original Oculus Quest at a $100 lower price. Sure it also lost the OLED and precise lens separation adjustment of its predecessor, but this didn't seem to matter much as the improved graphics and $300 price point propelled Quest 2 to a level of success no other VR headset has reached before or since. Quest 2 outsold all its predecessors combined within 6 months of being on sale. Meta has now shipped an estimated 20-30 million Quest 2 units through its four years on the market, similar to the number of Xbox Series X/S consoles sold so far. The first major standalone VR games to not support Quest 2 are launching soon, but many other VR apps will likely support Quest 2 for many years to come, and Quest 2's lenses and display will live on in Quest 3S. Building on the success of Quest 2, two years later Meta hoped it could introduce a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a battery in the rear of the strap, and ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was lacking. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful chipset at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of automatic room sensing for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And earlier this year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. When Quest Pro is off the market, Meta will no longer be selling any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time next year. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Meta Just Cut The 512GB Quest 3 To $500 And Will Discontinue The 128GB Model

The 128GB storage model of Quest 3 is being discontinued, and the 512GB model has been cut to its $500 price. Quest 3 launched a year ago with two models, 128GB storage for $500 or 512GB for $650. When stock of the 128GB model depletes, the 512GB option will be the sole Quest 3 model. Until that happens, the 128GB model is available at a discounted price of $430. This announcement comes as Meta just officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, a cheaper headset that has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and single panel from Quest 2. Meta also announced that it's discontinuing Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year or when stock runs out, whichever comes first. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: As well as simplifying Meta's lineup, this move could push many potential Quest 3S 256GB buyers up to Quest 3, since for $100 more they can get a slimmer headset with double the storage, pancake lenses, higher resolution, and precise IPD adjustment.

Title: Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: More similar than you'd expect

No offers found You'll be shocked how alike the Meta Quest 3S is to the costlier Quest 3, though some budget-friendly Quest 2 traits return. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Affordable upgrade Meta has made VR more accessible to consumers again by bringing next-gen gaming and mixed reality apps to the same price point that made the Quest 2 so popular. Its lenses and display are unchanged from the previous generation, but it's more powerful and versatile than ever. Full upgrade The Meta Quest 3 has the same game library and graphical power as the Quest 3S but makes those games more visually appealing with more pixels and a wider view. Plus you get all the storage space you could want. Whether that's enough to pay the extra $200 is up to you. The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you'll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories. If you're a Quest 2 owner, you might have been put off by the Quest 3's higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the Quest 3S has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now's a good time to choose the mainline headset, too. Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our Quest 3S hands-on demo at Connect, we'll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3! The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we'll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users. New CPU & extra RAM: Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the same games, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with graphical enhancements like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. Quest 3 exclusives: Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they're too graphically demanding for the Quest 2's headset. So far, we know of Batman: Arkham Shadow, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other upcoming Quest games are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. Full-color passthrough: Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality. Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have improved significantly in 2024; on the hardware end, Meta fixed mixed-reality warping and made MR apps use 80% less GPU processing in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you're getting a better MR experience right from the start. Controllers: The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics. Weight: Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. Accessories: We were surprised to learn that most of the best Quest 3 accessories should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we'll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit. The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3's 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack. The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our Quest 3 reviewer specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity. One of the Quest 3S' cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it's still 11.6mm thicker than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you'll probably want the same for the Quest 3S. Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics. Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2's shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2's interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn't match one of those three presets; it's just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3. Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won't work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it's phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more. Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don't hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did). Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). We assume that the Quest 3's higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We've asked Meta for confirmation on this. If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you're probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200. Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you'll have to spend the extra money either way. Even though we'll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the best VR headset today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset. Affordable upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3S if you want the power, game library, and mixed-reality passthrough of the Quest 3 for a lower price. Don't choose it if you dislike the Quest 2's visual experience and want something truly next-gen. Full upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3 for the most storage, a pixel-packed display, wider field of view, and better hand tracking via the depth sensor. Skip it if you're on a budget and can make do without every possible feature.

Goodbye Quest 2, Quest Pro, and 128GB Quest 3 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched the Meta Quest 3S (you can check out our hands on Meta Quest 3S review for our thoughts on it) and introduced us to a new affordable member of the Quest family, and also killed off three others. It’s time to officially say goodbye to the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3. The Meta Quest 2 has been sold out everywhere since July, so this announcement isn’t a surprise – it already happened. It’s sad, but with the 3S here, there’s no reason to pick up a Quest 2, frankly. It was fantastic, and I loved it, but it’s time for the next generation of XR hardware. The Meta Quest Pro has been hanging on, but its demise shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s never a good sign when a product drops one-third of its price in just six months on sale, and since the Quest 3 launch – a way cheaper headset that even performs better in a few key areas – the Quest Pro has very much faded into the background. Meta says these devices will still be on sale until the end of the year or until its remaining stock runs dry – whichever comes first. So if you want one for your collection, act fast, but if I were you, I’d pay attention to a different Quest that’s being killed off. My favorite of the trio: the Meta Quest 3 128GB. As leakers reported the day before Meta Connect, the Quest 3 128GB model is also being discontinued. The 512GB Meta Quest 3 will remain on sale, however, at a reduced price of $499.99 / £469.99 / AU$1,049.99. From now until the stock runs out, the 128GB Meta Quest 3 will be on sale for $429.99 / £409.99 / AU$799.99, and it looks like this could be the best headset to buy right now as it has all the upgrades of the full-Quest 3 while still being fairly affordable. Plus, given that VR games and apps aren’t big files 128GB is more than enough – especially as it’s so easy to delete and later redownload titles if you run out of storage. The only downside of this deal is you’ll miss out on the Batman: Arkham Shadow purchase bonus included with the Meta Quest 3S models and 512GB Meta Quest 3. This is a slight incentive to opt for the 512GB model instead, but even if you buy it separately the Meta Quest 3 128GB model is still a solid deal.

Title: Meta discontinues Quest 2 and Quest Pro | TechCrunch

Comment Hidden among the Meta Connect 2024 hardware announcements comes word that the social media giant is sunsetting two key members of its Quest VR headset line. With the budget Quest 3S now up for preorder, Meta will no longer sell the Quest 2 and Quest Pro once back stock is deleted. The end of the Quest 2 isn’t surprising. The headset is long in the tooth, celebrating its fourth birthday in October. Meta kept the legacy device on sale as a way to offer a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3. The new Quest 3S, however, now occupies its place in the lineup with its $300 starting price. It also shares some key characteristics with the new 3S model, including display resolution. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, debuted in 2022 as Meta’s bid to offer up its mixed reality for enterprise. The truth is, however, that last year’s Quest 3 made the Pro model largely redundant, and did so at a lower price point. Here’s what Meta has to say on the matter: “[Y]ou know what they say about new beginnings. With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first. If you’d like a carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers, the Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, we plan to continue selling those for a bit longer.” Notably, Meta is also ending security patch updates for the original Quest headset in September.

Title: 512GB Quest 3 Gets a Big Price Drop While 128GB Model is Phased Out

Say goodbye to the 128GB version of Quest 3, as the company is slated to only offer the 512GB version moving forward, and at a new, more attractive price. With the entrance of Quest 3S, and the discontinuation of Quest 2 and Quest Pro, Meta’s lineup is shifting a bit to make way for its new entry level XR headset, Quest 3S. Released in late 2023 for $650, the 512GB version of Quest 3 is still the company’s best-in-class headset. But now Quest 3 (512GB) is is dropping to just $500. Meanwhile, Quest 3 (128GB), which was originally $500, is being phased out. Meta is pricing Quest 3 (128GB) at $430 until supply is gone. Although the Quest 3 (128GB) price cut isn’t massive, it’s certainly not something to sneeze at if you absolutely need a great XR headset today and don’t want to go down a half-step with Quest 3S, which is being offered starting at $300 for the 128GB version and $400 for the 256GB version. Quest 3S is slated to launch on October 15th, offering the same resolution and Fresnel optics as Quest 2, but with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR gen 2 chipset as of Quest 3.

I think 10/15/2024, when the 3s is released. Prices already lowered in UK. Funny, I'm over here still rocking a 64GB Quest 2 and they didn't even list it LOL. I may have to grab that 128GB Quest 3S though. Looks nice. If it will run the new Batman game coming out, I'm all on board….

Title: Quest 2 and Quest Pro are Being Discontinued, Encouraging Wider Adoption of Mixed Reality

Out with the old, in with the new. Meta announced that the cheap and cheerful Quest 2 and the company’s pricey mixed reality pioneer Quest Pro are officially getting the boot, marking Meta’s next big push to bring mixed reality to the masses. There aren’t any official figures going around, but it’s safe to say Quest 2 was Meta’s most popular VR headset to date, coming just one year after the launch of the original Quest, which was released in May 2019. Still, even nearly three years after release, Quest 2 was so popular last Holiday season it handily outsold Quest 3 on Amazon. While it’s impossible to say whether Quest 3S will live up to Quest 2’s legacy, at an aggressive $300 price point for the entry-level 128GB model, it has a pretty good chance of again attracting plenty of eyeballs when it launches October 15th. So much can’t be said for Quest Pro, which always felt more like an expensive mixed reality dev kit than a consumer device, launching in 2022 for an eye-watering $1,500. Granted, Meta relented somewhat, bringing it down to $1,000 nearly a year after launch, likely owing to its overly exclusionary price point and lack of compelling MR content—something Meta hopes to deliver on starting with Quest 3S. That said, we’re unlikely to recommend Quest Pro over Quest 3 or Quest 3S due to the upcoming slate of Quest 3-exclusive content that notably doesn’t support Quest Pro. And with that, Meta is now officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Quest Pro. Remaining stock will be sold through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first, Meta says. Accessories for both are still going to be on offer, such as carrying cases, Touch Pro controllers, Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, with Meta noting it will to continue selling those “for a bit longer” after Quest 2 and QUest Pro headset supplies dry up. So, out with the old, in the with the new. Check out our hands-on with Quest 3S to get the full details on just why Meta thinks you might want its next XR headset.

It will hear two others that could radically reshape regulations on ghost guns and redefine corporate accountability in the tech industry. And it may confront urgent election-related litigation after Nov. 5 that tests the limits of the Electoral Count Act, depending on the aftermath of the presidential election. The new term begins as the Supreme Court is grappling with significant internal challenges and public scrutiny, as concerns about undisclosed gifts to certain Justices and ideologically divided decisions on some of the nation’s most divisive issues has raised questions about transparency and impartiality within the institution. A July 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 47% of Americans express a favorable opinion of the court following a consequential term, in which it granted presidents broad criminal immunity for some actions in office, preserved access to an abortion pill, and upheld a law that prevents those under a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing guns. Here are some of the key cases coming up this term. Perhaps the highest-profile case already on the docket, United States v. Skrmetti could have significant implications for transgender rights across the country. The case focuses on a Tennessee law that prohibits certain medical treatments for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and gender-transition surgeries. The case marks the first time the Justices will weigh in on the constitutionality of statewide bans of this nature, which have proliferated in approximately two dozen Republican-led states in recent years. The Tennessee law, known as SB1, has already stirred considerable controversy, with the Biden Administration and various advocacy groups arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has contended that the law discriminates against transgender individuals by allowing these medical interventions for other medical conditions while categorically banning them for gender dysphoria. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti defends the law as a necessary measure to protect minors from potentially irreversible treatments that may be based on "uncertain" benefits. The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case comes at a time of increasing legal fragmentation regarding transgender healthcare, with different federal courts issuing conflicting rulings. Legal analysts suggest that the Supreme Court’s ruling could establish a landmark precedent not only on transgender medical care but also on broader issues of civil rights, including access to public facilities and participation in sports. In Garland v. VanDerStok, the Justices will hear a case that challenges the Biden Administration’s regulation of ghost guns—untraceable firearms that can be assembled from kits and lack serial numbers. The case represents a critical moment in the ongoing debate over gun control, as the regulation was designed to combat the increasing prevalence of these weapons in crime scenes across the country. The rule, implemented in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), expands the definition of a firearm under the Gun Control Act of 1968. It mandates that unfinished parts, such as gun frames and receivers, must be serialized and licensed, ensuring that they can be traced. The regulation also requires background checks for the sale of these components. However, it has faced pushback from gun owners and manufacturers, who argue that it overreaches the authority granted to the ATF and violates the original intent of federal firearm laws. A federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to strike down the regulation. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor contended that the definition of a firearm does not encompass kits and parts, arguing that such interpretations should be the purview of Congress, not the judiciary. The ruling raised alarms among some law enforcement and advocacy groups, which fear that a Supreme Court decision against the regulation could lead to an influx of ghost guns, complicating efforts to address gun violence. The Supreme Court is set to determine the legality of a Texas law mandating age verification for users of pornographic websites. The case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, could have significant implications for First Amendment rights, as the state law, enacted in June 2023, aims to restrict minors from accessing sexually explicit content by requiring users to provide personal information for age verification. Proponents of the law, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, argue that it is necessary to protect minors from exposure to harmful material. They assert that requiring age verification ensures that only adults can access pornography, thus addressing a pressing public safety concern. However, critics, including the Free Speech Coalition, contend that the law infringes upon the constitutional rights of adults, creating a chilling effect on access to protected speech. They argue that the measure is overbroad and fails to account for the privacy risks associated with submitting personal information online. Read More: How an Ordained Rabbi Ended Up Owning the World’s Most Famous Porn Company A federal district judge initially blocked the law, citing concerns that it imposes unnecessary restrictions on adult access to constitutionally protected material. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later permitted the law to take effect, ruling that the age verification requirement is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in preventing minors from accessing pornography. However, dissenting opinions within the panel highlighted the law's potential to limit access to protected speech for adults, raising questions about its constitutionality. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments, a case that will evaluate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to deny marketing authorization for flavored e-cigarettes produced by Triton Distribution. The case comes amid ongoing concerns about the popularity of vaping among young people and the agency's efforts to regulate products that might appeal to minors. At the heart of the dispute is the FDA's rejection of applications for sweet-flavored e-liquids, including varieties such as "Jimmy The Juice Man Peachy Strawberry" and "Killer Kustard Blueberry." The agency contends that these products pose a "serious, well-documented risk" of enticing young users, contributing to alarming rates of e-cigarette use among adolescents. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students reported using e-cigarettes, with flavored options being the overwhelming choice, the FDA said in court documents. They have argued that companies failed to demonstrate that the benefits of their products for adult smokers outweighed the risks of underage consumption. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously sided with Triton, declaring that the FDA had acted in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner by imposing new requirements for studies on smoking cessation that had not been communicated prior to the companies’ applications. The implications of the case could extend beyond flavored e-cigarettes. The court's decision may clarify the FDA's authority under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which mandates that new tobacco products be proven “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” The Justices will hear Meta’s appeal in a high-stakes class action lawsuit related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has drawn significant scrutiny over the misuse of user data. The high court will review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed the lawsuit, spearheaded by Amalgamated Bank on behalf of shareholders, to proceed. Investors allege that Meta misled them about the risks associated with Facebook user data being improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit claims that inadequate disclosures led to substantial drops in Meta’s stock price in 2018, following revelations that the personal information of approximately 87 million Facebook users had been exploited without consent. The litigation, initiated in 2018, accuses Meta and its executives of violating the Securities Exchange Act by making false statements regarding data security risks that had already materialized. In its defense, Meta argues that the 9th Circuit's ruling sets a troubling precedent that could require public companies to disclose historical incidents that do not pose current risks. Meta has already faced penalties, including a $5 billion fine and a $725 million settlement related to user privacy violations. In NVIDIA v. E. Ohman J, the Supreme Court will consider a case that challenges the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of fraudulent intent in shareholder class action lawsuits. The core of the dispute revolves around allegations that Nvidia misrepresented its dependence on the volatile cryptocurrency mining market, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Shareholders claim that the company’s CEO made misleading statements about demand for its products, failing to disclose crucial information that could indicate a risk of mismanagement. At the heart of the case is the legal standard for establishing "scienter," or the intent to deceive, which requires plaintiffs to present specific facts demonstrating that a defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard. Nvidia, whose computer chips the world relies on to make AI systems, argues that the Ninth Circuit improperly accepted vague allegations from unnamed former employees and speculative analyses from hired experts, rather than concrete evidence of fraudulent intent. The company contends that such reliance on speculation undermines the stringent requirements set forth in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A ruling in favor of Nvidia could reinforce higher standards for investor claims and potentially reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, while a decision that supports the Ninth Circuit's stance might embolden shareholders to pursue more claims based on less concrete evidence, experts say.

Title: Things are looking up for the economy. So why are consumers still unhappy?

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s 2024 Election Plan: Make Facebook, Instagram Less Political

Sports and celebrity news are now prioritized over election coverage on Meta’s social media platforms You may have noticed less political content on your Instagram and Facebook feeds this year — and that’s by design. Specifically, it’s the design of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who, according to The New York Times on Tuesday, wants his platforms to be less politically charged heading into the 2024 election. “On Facebook, Instagram and Threads, political content is less heavily featured,” the Times reported. “App settings have been automatically set to de-emphasize the posts that users see about campaigns and candidates.” Rather than political coverage, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news. That’s a stark change from four years ago, when Meta — then still under its original Facebook name — hit users with political news more frequently. The company, at the same time, actively policed content tied to the Trump-Biden election, as well as COVID-19. In mid-2020, Facebook started putting warning labels on posts from politicians and public figures that it deemed misinformation; the company also expanded its “hate speech” policy at the time. Zuckerberg, in the year leading up to the 2020 election, said he was “very focused on election security“; the company changed its rules around political ads, making it so American political advertisers had to have a U.S. address, for example. Facebook also had 40 teams, including an “election security” team, that partnered with Homeland Security, law enforcement and state and local election officials to oversee how the election was presented on Facebook and Instagram. That’s become less of a concern for Zuckerberg this time around. For instance, Zuckerberg no longer meets with his heads of election security on a weekly basis, the NYT reported, adding: “He has reduced the number of full-time employees working on the issue and disbanded the election integrity team … though the company says the election integrity workers were integrated into other teams.” Facebook was also active on the political front in the months after the 2020 election. Most notably, the company “indefinitely” banned Trump, saying the risk of having him on the platform was “simply too great” after the January 2021 Capitol Riot (Facebook and Instagram lifted all restrictions on Trump in July). One reason to expect Meta’s shift away from politics to continue: it hasn’t hurt business. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since Election Day 2020, and is up 63% on the year to $564 per share. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Super League Gaming stock hits 52-week low at $0.52

Super League Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ:SLE) shares tumbled to a 52-week low this week, touching down at $0.52. The esports community and content platform has faced a challenging market environment, reflecting a broader downturn in tech and entertainment stocks. Over the past year, Super League Gaming has seen its stock price plummet, with a staggering 1-year change of -71.12%. This significant decline has brought the company's shares to their lowest point in the last year, underscoring the hurdles the company faces as it strives to pivot its strategy and regain investor confidence amidst a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, Super League Gaming has released its Q2 2024 financial results, highlighting a strategic push toward profitability by Q4 2024. The company's operational progress is marked by a decrease in operating expenses and losses, and an expansion of partnerships and offerings. One significant collaboration is with Meta-Stadiums in the metaverse, aiming to create virtual stadiums. Despite flat revenues in Q2 2024 and delays in advertising campaigns due to inflation's impact on consumer spending, Super League Gaming has seen a decrease in operating expenses and losses. This indicates improved efficiency and a promising outlook for the company. The company has also launched immersive experiences with major brands such as the International Olympic Committee, Visa (NYSE:V), Maybelline, Claire's, Skechers, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Universal Pictures. These collaborations have led to high engagement and conversion rates. In further developments, Super League Gaming is focusing on transitioning repeat customers into long-term campaigns and setting annual booking records. The company's CEO, Ann Hand, expressed confidence in the company's strategy and its role in the future of immersive worlds as a media channel. Super League Gaming Inc. (SLE) has been navigating a turbulent period, as reflected in the company's recent market performance. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest 5.63 million USD, illustrating the scale of its financial footprint in the esports and entertainment industry. Despite the challenges, one of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that SLE holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide some financial flexibility in its strategic pivot. Additionally, the stock's recent movements suggest it is in oversold territory, based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), hinting at a potential undervaluation by the market. However, with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -0.08 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 at -0.23, investors are shown a company that is not currently generating profits relative to its share price. The revenue growth of 25.12% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 does provide a silver lining, indicating some level of business expansion despite the stock price's decline. It is also worth noting that the stock has been quite volatile, with a 1-week price total return of -22.3% and a 1-year price total return of -69.49%, which may deter risk-averse investors. For readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available on the platform, which could offer further insights into Super League Gaming's financial health and stock performance.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock – Needham
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2024/09/24/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham/

Update font size. Reset Needham & Company analysts have outlined three compelling reasons for investors to maintain a bullish outlook on Apple stock, even amidst concerns about the company’s reliance on the iPhone. These analysts believe that Apple’s strong “stable and liquid” fundamentals, huge share repurchase program, and the company’s strong cash position provide a solid foundation for continued growth and success. Sam Boughedda for Investing.com: ‎ The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company’s $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. Needham believes Apple’s commitment to achieving “net cash zero” from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Needham maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a target price of $260 per share, an upside of some 16% over the current price.

Title: The Quest 3 may undergo a significant pricing change

Time Published: 2024-09-24T15:46:40Z

Meta Connect 2024 is tomorrow, which means the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S is about to be revealed (we hope). Despite the event being only hours away, however, there are still more leaks to be had. The latest information, spotted by TechRadar, suggests that with the launch of the 3S, Meta will discount both Meta Quest 3 models and stop production of the 128GB model sometime in November. These leaks come from X (formerly Twitter) users CezaryXR, the editor-in-chief at XR Daily News, and Lunayian, who has posted multiple Quest 3S leaks before, including images of what appears to be marketing material for the 3S. Finally, later in March 2023 u/LuffySanKira on Reddit claims they were shown these &quot;Meta Quest 3s&quot; mockups in what was likely a User Research Zoom call. They were deleted shortly after. The account has an age of 3 years with little activity in VR, and is still active. 13/x 🧵 pic.twitter.com/kq0wTdDodz &mdash; Luna (@Lunayian) March 26, 2024 According to CezaryXR, there will be two models of the Quest 3S — a 128GB model priced at around $300 and a 256GB version for about $400. These prices are very similar to the Quest 2 and much lower than the Quest 3’s current $499 and $649 price tags. If the leak is accurate, Meta will also stop producing the 128GB Quest 3 model sometime in November, meaning it won’t be available to buy after stock runs out. At the same time, both Quest 3 models will get a discount — but we don’t know how low the prices will go. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect: Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant. Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available. &mdash; Cezary Sobociński (@CezaryXR) September 23, 2024 Although a discount sounds like a good thing, in the long run, it could raise the price overall. Once 128GB stock runs out, people will have no choice but to buy the 512GB model — and with that much storage, it seems very unlikely that even its discounted price will be close to the cheaper model’s $499. Assuming the Quest 3S pricing estimates are accurate, that will leave buyers with three options: Our first thoughts in looking at these prices are that people would love the super affordable Quest 3S models, but sales for the Quest 3 would surely go down. It’s hard to believe that’s what Meta wants, so there’s definitely room for these leaks to be a little off. It’s all unofficial speculation anyway, so it’s always best to take it with skepticism The best part about this leak is that we only need to wait 24 hours to have the record set straight. Make sure to check our coverage of Meta Connect tomorrow for all the latest news on the Quest 3S and the fate of the Quest 3. Logitech has announced its first piece of hardware in the VR space, a stylus that lets you draw and paint in 3D on the Meta Quest 3. The MX Ink Stylus is a familiar-looking sketching tool that works hand in hand with the Quest controller to drastically expand the capabilities of the popular Quest 3 VR headset. The MX Ink also works with the Quest Pro and Quest 2 and supports several painting and sculpting Quest apps, including Gravity Sketch, PaintingVR, OpenBrush, ShapesXR, GestureVR, Arkio, and Engage XR. If you connect your Quest to a VR-ready PC, you can use the MX Ink Stylus with Adobe’s Substance Modeler and Elucis by Realize Medical. The Meta Quest 3 was already one of the best VR headsets for mixed reality, while keeping costs affordable. Soon Quest 3 owners will see a big upgrade that removes the distortion that sometimes broke the immersive feeling, simply by updating their headsets. Meta has announced the v66 software update that, among many things, comes with improvements to the Quest 3's passthrough cameras. Since the Quest 3’s passthrough cameras are located a couple of inches in front of your eyes, the headset must adjust the image to match your true perspective. Otherwise, everything would seem slightly zoomed in. Distant objects are easy, but nearby hands hide a portion of the background, presenting a challenge. A Windows app extends into 3D space via a Meta Quest 3 VR headset.

Visa (V) shares fell Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the payment processing giant over allegedly monopolistic behavior to protect its dominant position in the debit card market. "Visa has been the largest, most powerful debit network for over a decade," the DOJ wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court. It alleged that the company's contracts with merchants "unlawfully inhibit competition and stifle innovation." An antitrust lawsuit led Visa and competing payment processor Plaid to abandon merger talks in January 2021. The DOJ said at the time that the planned $5.3 billion merger was an example of Visa's monopolistic behavior, as it looked to acquire a potential rival before it was large enough to effectively challenge it. "We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable," said Visa General Counsel Julie Rottenberg in an email. "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” Bloomberg and The New York Times earlier reported a DOJ filing was imminent, causing Visa stock to trade lower throughout the session Tuesday. The shares closed down more than 5%. The lawsuit is the latest move from the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in recent years to use antitrust laws to block mergers and challenge dominant companies like Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (LYV), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). Visa shares fell more than 5% to $273.76 soon before the closing bell Tuesday. They are up 5% this year. UPDATE: This story has been updated to note the filing of the lawsuit, add a statement from Visa, and update the share price.

Title: Oppenheimer analysts initiate coverage of Pinterest with "Outperform" rating
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oppenheimer-analysts-initiate-coverage-of-pinterest-with-outperform-rating-3629814

Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has the smallest daily active user base among social media companies, but there is "upside" to the company stemming from engagement and advertising on the platform, according to analysts at Oppenheimer. In a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts noted that Pinterest, which is known for its pinboards designed to spark ideas on everything from recipes to weddings, has the fastest-growing digital advertising offering outside of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). "Pinterest operates a global discovery platform with high-intent users in search of products and inspiration, lending itself well to direct response advertising. Relevant ads improve the core user experience, like magazines, driving strong advertiser [return on investment]," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote. They initiated their coverage of the firm with an "Outperform" rating and a share price target of $45. "Ads drive increased engagement, which brings more advertisers, better data, more users, and higher ad pricing. More than half of users think of Pinterest as a place to shop, and 96% of searches are unbranded (e.g., “red dress”) further indicating access to unique inventory," the Oppenheimer analysts said. In July, Pinterest's stock price tumbled by around 15% after the company's third-quarter revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. The business said it now expects to post sales of $885 million to $900 million during the period, below estimates of roughly $907 million. However, Pinterest said it had 522 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, above analysts' forecasts, while quarterly average revenue per person of $1.64 met estimates. Speaking in a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly noted that Pinterest's "more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform," although she flagged "broader headwinds" are weighing on ad spending by food and beverage groups. In general, however, Pinterest executives said the market for advertising was "relatively stable" in the second quarter.

Title: Meta might soon cut the Meta Quest 3 price and discontinue the 128GB model

The Meta Quest 3S could shake things up more than we thought When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Update: It's confirmed, Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets including the 128GB Meta Quest 3, though it is getting a price cut while it's still available. Original story continues below. As I’m writing this, Meta Connect 2024 is just a day away, which means we’re also just a day away from (hopefully) finally seeing the Meta Quest 3S in action – Connect is where many expect the much-leaked headset will make its debut. But its arrival could also be the end of one of the two Meta Quest 3 models, because leaks suggest the 128GB Quest 3 could be discontinued after the 3S launch. This comes from two sources, @CezaryXR – Editor-In-Chief at XRDailyNews – and @Lunayian – the source of most Quest 3S leaks, just ahead of Meta itself. CezaryXR claims that the Quest 3S will have two models: a 128GB variant at around $300 and a 256GB model at around $400; this matches the price in that supposed leaked Amazon ad, and aligns roughly with the Quest 2’s prices of $299 / £299 / AU$479 and $399 / £399 / AU$599 for its two models respectively. What’s more, Meta will also reportedly stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November – so when it sells out it won’t come back. Both current Quest 3 models (128GB and 512GB) will be discounted too. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect:Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant.Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available.September 23, 2024 Lunayian shared the post adding they “heard similar whispers” – however neither source can confirm what prices the Meta Quest 3 headsets will fall to. In either case, it’s worth remembering to take these leaks with a pinch of salt, however they do support my one big piece of advice for anyone keen to buy a VR headset right now: wait. While I think a Quest 3 price drop makes sense (more on that below) whether it happens or not the Quest 3S looks set to be a headset at least worth considering – something you can’t do until it’s official. One question I’ve had about the Quest 3S is how its value proposition will stack up against the regular Quest 3. Yes the rumors say it’ll be bulkier, and have slightly worse specs in areas like its display and RAM – but still boast an identical processor – though as long as these downgrades don’t affect its performance too massively, the main deciding factor will be price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And here there’s a lot of room for error. Make the Quest 3S too pricey and the Quest 3 will remain a no-brainer upgrade killing the new model, make it too cheap and the regular Quest 3’s sales could tank – yes older models get replaced eventually, but VR headsets are not yet at the yearly refresh cycle of smartphones (and they shouldn’t be). This is why I was starting to convince myself the Quest 3S would start at around $350, or even $400 rather than being as cheap as the Quest 2 like many hoped. The strategy outlined in the leak above however is an alternative way to walk this pricing tightrope. Eliminating the cheaper Quest 3 helps to create more of a distinction between the Quest 3S models and the top of the line Quest 3, meaning we can have our super-affordable Quest 3S without as much risk of it cannibalizing its predecessor. Unfortunately, while the Meta Quest 3 will get a price drop according to the leaks, I suspect the 512GB model will land a little above the 128GB version’s current price of $499 / £479 / AU$799. If that’s the case, then when the 128GB model sells out the Quest 3 would get an effective price increase, which wouldn’t be ideal. We’ll have to wait and see what’s announced at Meta Connect 2024 and beyond, but if the leaks hold true I’d recommend trying to snatch up a 128GB Meta Quest 3 while you can as that’s looking like my pick for the best of the four Quest 3/3S models, and it might not be around for much longer.

September 24, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from three deep diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing and fully-funded 35,000 metre drill program, and represent the first deep drill holes of the current campaign. The three drill holes reported today represent an approximately 200 metre wide fence to the west, centre and east of the down-plunge extension of a high grade mineralization trend at the Project labeled “Trend 1.” The fence was located at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource and below the level of the historic workings at the adjacent O’Brien mine. Of note, DDH OB-24-324, the central hole of the fence located directly below “Trend 1”, returned a wide intersection of high-grade mineralization with extensive visible gold (Figures 1, 2 & 3 and Tables 1 & 2). Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “The results reported today represent a significant extension of high-grade mineralization at the O’Brien Project at depth. We have successfully intersected the down plunge extension of one of the principal high-grade gold trends at O’Brien. The 6-metre core interval of almost an ounce per tonne gold in OB-24-324, well mineralized throughout and with extensive visible gold, was achieved in the location predicted by our deposit model at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, a full 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. The two other deep holes reported today also intersected vein mineralization within alteration zones at the same depth, confirming the lateral continuity of the O’Brien mineralizing system generally and with noteworthy high-grade intercepts in OB-24-322 in particular. Taken together, this deep drilling is demonstrating the significant upside potential of the Project below the existing Mineral Resource. Two rigs are currently active, one targeting shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and one continuing to target deeper, down-plunge step-outs. We will be reporting additional drill results as they become available.” Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring adjacent to the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the Historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.62 million tonnes at 8.64 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trends 0 to 5”, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Table 1: Summary Assay Results from DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 40-80% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill Hole OB-24-321 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au based on unofficial assays received to date (official assay certificates for three samples in OB-24-321, covering the interval italicised in Table 2, are pending). Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P: Piché conglomerate; S3P: Piché sediments; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North. Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from three drill holes over 3,660 metres in Trend 1. Visible gold was observed in each hole. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -77 and -85 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be between 40 and 80% of core length.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock: Needham

Investing.com -- Needham & Company analysts provided three key reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock despite concerns about its dependence on the iPhone. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, with a target price of $260 per share, representing a 16% upside. A Liquid Stock During Uncertainty: The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. In a volatile market, they argue that investors need a reliable stock to "hide in" during 2025, making Apple an attractive option. Share Repurchases Driving EPS Growth: Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company's $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. This continued buyback strategy is expected to support the bullish outlook for Apple. Strong Cash Position Enables Further Buybacks: Needham believes Apple's commitment to achieving "net cash zero" from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. This financial strategy is expected to further enhance shareholder returns. Despite concerns about Apple's reliance on the iPhone and its slower pace of GenAI adoption compared to peers, Needham & Company believes Apple's financial discipline and stock buyback strategy make it a strong investment opportunity.

Title: Bernard Arnault plummets down the list of world’s richest men after a $54 billion collapse
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/bernard-arnault-richest-man/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
“As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy,” Bernard Arnault once said. The day has come. Arnault, the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, went from being the richest person in the world to the fifth-most after a 20% drop in his company’s stock price, resulting in a $54 billion cut of his net worth. Arnault, who oversees dozens of prestigious brands including Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, was worth an estimated $231 billion in late March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. As of Monday, Arnault was worth an estimated $177 billion. Now, Arnault ranks lower than each of those executives, plus Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In the past year, LVMH stock has dropped over 16%, and is currently trading at about $132 per share; Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate. Since the start of 2024, Arnault’s net worth is down $30 billion, making him the biggest loser on the list year-to-date. LVMH did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. During the first half of 2024, LVMH reported a modest dip in revenues, but its wine and spirits divisions fared even worse. “Maybe the current global situation, be it geopolitical or macroeconomic, doesn’t lead people to cheer up and open bottles of champagne,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call in late July. “I don’t really know. The matter of fact is, is that our volumes are down double digits.” But it’s not just LVMH that’s had a tough time in today’s market. Other major luxury brands and holding houses have reported losses this year. In fact, luxury revenues were flat during Q2 2024, the slowest growth in 15 quarters, according to a Bank of America note about luxury goods released Monday. Demand deteriorated during July, and August and September have also slowed. Michael Kors, housed under Capri Holdings, saw its first quarter revenue drop more than 14% year-over-year, according to Capri’s first quarter fiscal 2025 results posted Aug. 8. “Sometimes you’ll be the hottest thing on the block,” Michael Kors said in his testimony during an $8.5 billion antitrust trial involving Capri Holdings and Tapestry. “Sometimes you’ll be lukewarm. Sometimes you’ll be cold.” While Arnault has lost a tremendous amount of wealth this year as the result of the struggling luxury market, with a net worth of $177 billion, he’s still wealthier than former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as well as Warren Buffett, Michael Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Plus, Arnault has stayed active in investing this year. His family office has invested in five AI-focused startups this year amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Plus, in July, he joined the chase to acquire Venice’s iconic Hotel Bauer for $305 million—but got outbid. Arnault, 75, isn’t ready to leave his post: He forced his board to extend the retirement age for its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80 so he could stay longer. But he received a letter from 93-year-old Warren Buffett saying he should’ve made the age limit higher, according to Bloomberg. Still, Arnault says he’s working 12-hour days. “Every morning I have fun when I arrive,” Arnault told Bloomberg. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has sold a significant amount of company stock, according to a recent filing. The transactions, which took place on September 19, 2024, involved the sale of 20,000 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A Common Stock at prices ranging from $555.00 to $560.25 per share. The total value of the shares sold by Cox amounts to approximately $11,150,486. The sales were conducted in multiple transactions within the stated price range. The filing indicated that these transactions were executed pursuant to a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Cox adopted on April 26, 2024. Following the sale, Cox's remaining direct holdings in Meta Platforms amount to 338,662 shares of Class A Common Stock, held through the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust. Additionally, the filing disclosed that Cox is a co-trustee of the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into the confidence levels of a company's executives and their perspectives on the firm's future prospects. The transactions by Cox are part of the normal course of stock trading by executives and are disclosed to the public through mandatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meta Platforms, known for its social media and technology services, has not commented on these transactions. The sales are a routine part of stock ownership and portfolio management for many executives and do not necessarily indicate a change in the company's outlook or strategy. For those interested in the details of the transactions, the filing is available for public review, and further information about the specific prices of shares sold can be provided upon written request to the issuer or the SEC. In other recent news, Meta Platforms has been spotlighted by Roth Capital for its strong growth in cost per thousand impressions (CPMs), a key metric for online advertising effectiveness. The technology giant has seen its CPM growth accelerate from approximately 27% year-over-year in the first quarter to an estimated 40% in the third quarter. This consistent positive trend points to robust advertising demand on Meta's services. In addition, BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating for Meta, anticipating the launch of advanced AI chat options and new AI capabilities for WhatsApp and Messenger. The firm also expects updates on Llama, Meta's growing open-source language model, at an upcoming developer event. Moreover, Meta has procured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits in a deal with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm, marking a significant step towards its net-zero emissions goal by 2030. Lastly, Meta, alongside other tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is actively engaged with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act. These are the latest developments in the company's journey. In light of the recent insider transactions at Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), an analysis of the company's financial health and market performance may offer additional context for investors.

From a market performance standpoint, Meta Platforms boasts an impressive market capitalization of $1.43 trillion. The company's revenue growth over the last twelve months has been strong at 24.28%, with a gross profit margin of 81.49%, underscoring its efficiency in generating income from its sales. Moreover, the firm is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a P/E ratio of 26.34, which could suggest that the stock is undervalued given its earnings potential.

NEW YORK – US stocks closed modestly higher on Sept 23 as investors assessed whether a trend will develop in the week following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The gains came amid comments from Fed policymakers and steady factory activity data, building on last week’s sharp market rally after the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates. The Fed’s pivotal move last week pushed major indexes to monthly gains, defying the historical trend of September as a weak month for equities. Comments on Sept 23 from three reserve bank presidents were the main focus as investors searched for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis-point cut. Fed officials including Mr Raphael Bostic, Mr Neel Kashkari and Mr Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Trader bets, as per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, initially favoured a larger Fed move at its upcoming November meeting, after Governor Christopher Waller on Sept 20 flagged that upcoming inflation data could undershoot the Fed’s 2 per cent target. However, the bets have swayed since then and now appear to be a coin-toss, with markets expecting a total reduction of 74 basis points by the year end, according to LSEG data. On the data front, US business activity remained steady in September, while average prices for goods and services increased at the fastest pace in six months, potentially signalling a rise in inflation in the months ahead. “I think investors are still just sort of taking a wait-and-see attitude, if indeed a soft landing is the most likely outcome.” said Mr Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.29 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 42,124.65, the S&P 500 gained 16.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,718.57 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 25.95 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 17,974.27. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy stocks led gains with a 1.31 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.25 per cent. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.65 per cent, while Meta Platforms rose 0.6 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. The Russell 2000 index, tracking small caps, was off 0.25 per cent. All eyes are on Sept 27’s personal consumption expenditures figure for August – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts say this release will be the week’s most significant catalyst. Among top movers, Intel rose 3.05 per cent after a media report said Apollo offered to make an investment of as much as US$5 billion (S$6.46 billion) in the chipmaker. General Motors slipped 1.72 per cent after Bernstein downgraded the carmaker’s stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 505 new highs and 36 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 123 new lows.

Title: Goldman Sachs maintains buy on Arista Networks, price target $430
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-maintains-buy-on-arista-networks-price-target-430-93CH-3628796

On Monday, Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) with a steady price target of $430.00. The firm is projecting Arista Networks to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, citing increased confidence in their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for these years. The revised EPS estimate for 2024 is now $8.39, up from the previous $8.35 and higher than the FactSet consensus of $8.27. For 2025, the EPS estimate has been set at $9.91, compared to the prior $9.86 and above the consensus of $9.39. The optimism from Goldman Sachs is based on several key factors, including anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm also highlighted the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects expected in the next year and the momentum in Ethernet deployments across Arista's target five major AI cluster projects. Additionally, the firm noted Arista's expectations of increased front end networking investment relative to back end spending. Arista Networks' competitive edge is attributed to its top-tier switching platform, which offers scale up and scale out capabilities. This positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly adopting integrated compute systems. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Arista will not only meet its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025 but will also continue to grow beyond that year. Goldman Sachs expects Arista Networks to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. This forecast aligns with the company's history of exceeding the midpoint of its EBIT margin guidance by an average of approximately 260 basis points over the last 26 quarters. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been in the spotlight with significant developments. The company reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on Arista, projecting a revenue growth target of at least 14% in 2024, while Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Arista also repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. These recent developments underscore the company's strong market position and potential for continued growth. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. With these developments, Arista Networks continues to make strides in its industry. As Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish stance on Arista Networks, citing robust revenue growth and competitive advantages, InvestingPro data and tips provide additional insights for investors considering ANET stock. The company's strong financial health is reflected in a market capitalization of $121.21 billion and significant revenue growth, with the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 showing a 19.93% increase. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025. InvestingPro Tips highlight Arista Networks as a prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry with a high return over the last year, suggesting investor confidence in the company's performance and strategy. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, indicating a solid position to meet its financial commitments. However, investors should be aware of the stock trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 48.95, and near its 52-week high, which could imply a premium valuation. For those seeking a deeper dive into Arista Networks' financial health and stock performance, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips to help investors make informed decisions.

Title: Trump Media’s Stock Price Sinks to New Low After Insider Lockup Period Expires

Former president has said he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in company that operates Truth Social By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company, which operates the unprofitable Truth Social platform, dropped 10.3% Monday to their lowest price since the stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DJT” earlier in 2024. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock closed at $12.15/share, down nearly 82% from the company’s peak closing price of $66.22/share on March 27. The slump for the stock comes after a six-month lockup period on shares held by TMTG insiders — including Trump, TMTG’s directors and officers, and certain other securityholders — expired at the end of regular trading Thursday, Sept. 19. Related Stories VIP+ Netflix vs. YouTube: The Post-Streaming Wars Era’s Archrivalry Courteney Cox Says 'I'm Not Officially Signed On' for 'Scream 7' Yet and Hopes Dewey Can Appear: 'They Have to Figure It Out' Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his shares in TMTG. “A lot of people think the reason [the company’s stock price is] down is a lot of people think I’m going to sell, and if I sell, it’s not going to be the same,” Trump said at a Sept. 13 press conference, per CBS News. “But I have absolutely no intention of selling.” Popular on Variety TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $2.4 billion. That’s down from an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $1.4 billion — down from $5.2 billion at stock’s the highest closing price. The 114.75 million shares Trump holds includes 36 million “earnout shares” that TMTG determined he was entitled to in accordance with the merger agreement. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. According to an Aug. 23 filing with the SEC, TMTG’s board and audit committee authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the company’s common stock “from certain executive employees” at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, TMTG said, it will remit $2.9 million plus applicable penalties and interest to the IRS and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7 issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes. “TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” the company said in its most recent 10-Q filing. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.” The filing also noted that Trump “is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation.” Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company says in its prospectus.
