Title: The world's 10 richest people are $500 billion wealthier this year, thanks to the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/28/what-caused-constellation-energy-stock-to-surge-by-80/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio This week on the podcast. Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time. My pleasure. Always really, really interesting. We have been speaking with Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief investment strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in client funds.

Title: The stock market is staring down a chaotic mix of its 4 most important catalysts this week

Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In the market, entire weeks can pass without any real catalyst. Inspiration can run thin, which can lead to traders talking themselves into tepid moves based on minimal information. This is definitely not one of those weeks. In fact, every single one of the four main narratives is in play concurrently, setting up an unpredictable period of trading. After all, the market is not a kung-fu movie, dispatching developments in orderly fashion, one at a time. It's more like John Wick, with complications constantly coming from all angles, often multiple at once. Let's recap the landscape, and how each driver could shape markets in the near term: Catalyst 1: The Fed The next FOMC meeting kicks off today, with the culmination on Wednesday, when the central bank announces its latest interest-rate decision. The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. What could happen: A single rate cut is priced in with 98% certainty, so any volatility will result from Powell's comments. If he laments that inflation is peskily high, that could dent rate-cut hopes and send stocks lower. But if he complains about any other struggling economic force — like the labor market — that could stoke expectations of more aggressive cuts, giving stocks a boost. Catalyst 2: AI fever The latest big development in this space came on Monday as Qualcomm threw its hat in the ring by announcing new chips and computers. This sent the company's stock surging (see below) and lifted chip names overall. Another week, another shuffling of major AI players — and this time OpenAI wasn't even involved. What could happen: Even if the Qualcomm-adjacent stock moves are limited to a single day, the company's announcement further raises investor antennae for new products and cross-company collaborations — all of which have been rocket fuel for associated stocks. Catalyst 3: Earnings season This week is as big as it gets. Across Wednesday and Thursday, the following mega-cap tech giants report: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. That's 25% of the S&P 500 right there. What could happen: At risk of stating the obvious, strong results should lead to stock gains. The question then becomes: what constitutes "strong"? For this group, which is enmeshed in the AI race, strength can be defined in a couple ways, namely: (1) better-than-expected future earnings forecasts and (2) tangible results of massive AI spending. Catalyst 4: Trade progress This is last chronologically, but certainly not least, since a reported US-China treaty was the main source of record highs for stocks on Monday. The main event comes on Thursday, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet. What could happen: Looking at the index level, trade-war progress is unabashedly positive. Fewer tariffs and more global collaboration is a good thing, especially for US exporters. At the sector and single-stock level, it's a bit more unpredictable, although there has been an unwinding of trades that benefited from US-China gridlock. For instance, safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys gave up some gains on Monday, while US-affiliated rare-mineral stocks took a tumble. Expect this to continue if further progress is solidified. Let's play a game: Can you tell the exact moment that Qualcomm announced its new lineup of semiconductor chips, with the intention of challenging Nvidia? All kidding aside, this was a momentous moment not just for the share price, but for the whole AI race broadly. While Qualcomm is a comparatively late entrant to the battle for AI supremacy, the company argues that its existing mobile technology will differentiate its chips. The market certainly seemed to agree, lifting shares 11% on the day, up 22% at intraday highs. Interestingly, Nvidia didn't take a dive on the increased competition, and was instead pulled higher alongside other chipmaker stocks. Even when someone comes at the king, the king still wins. Today's chart comes from Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo. It shows that the US currently has more data centers built than all other major countries combined. It has 5,425, more than 10 times Germany, which is in a distant second place. "The bottom line is that the rest of the world is far behind the US when it comes to AI," Slok wrote. Be sure to browse Business Insider's interactive map, which shows where data centers are all across the US. And check out the full investigation here. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. There's been plenty of recent chatter — and debate — about a potential AI bubble. Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, is leaning into the "not a bubble" narrative. He says the next few months are actually a good time to buy mega-cap tech stocks leading the AI trade, and he offers three main reasons why. The first is earnings, with Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple scheduled to report this week. "They should all be good because we came into the earnings season with estimates brought down a bit," Roberts told BI about the bevy of tech stocks reporting. Second is buybacks, which have historically been a way for companies to engineer stock gains and signal to investors that they think their stock is affordable. Repurchases are up 16% year-over-year, and companies that do them have been rewarded, Goldman Sachs data shows. "We're going to have about $6 to $7 billion a day in corporate buybacks starting in early November," Roberts said. "That's going to provide an uplift." Third, he points out that discretionary traders from institutions like hedge funds are underweight tech stocks at the moment. Roberts thinks their re-entry can fuel a rebound. "There's going to be a catch-up run, particularly in AI, as we approach the year-end reporting period," he said. For investors looking to follow his advice, funds like the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) offer exposure to mega-cap tech names. We're maintaining the First Trade index, an equal-weighted basket of five stocks that will be adjusted each week. After one rebalancing, we ended up with this group: Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Tesla. Each week, you'll vote one stock out, and one in. Last week we added Tesla, and this week we'll be sliding in Nvidia. It doesn't have earnings this week, but it's wildly popular with retail traders and has been absolutely scorching for the past few years. Its inclusion will come at the expense of J&J, which will be removed. And with that, our portfolio has gotten even more tech-heavy, and more levered towards the AI theme that's ruled markets. How will it work out? Check back next Monday, Nov. 3, for an update. The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: Here’s What Trump’s Ballroom Donors Want
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
The cost of Donald Trump’s garish ballroom that’s replacing the East Wing of the White House keeps increasing, from $200 million to $300 million and now $350 million in a matter of days. That’s because the cost of construction isn’t nearly as important as having an inventory of donations available for corporate America to pony up. These contributions—or if you prefer, bribes—work in two directions. One, they represent cash that companies can give to secure favors from the government. Two, they serve as a disciplining function from Trump: People giving to his ballroom can’t easily speak out against his abuses of power. It’s no real surprise that the formal editorial page of The Washington Post offered a limp defense of the ballroom, when the company founded by the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, is one of the donors. The White House has said it would allow ballroom donors to remain anonymous, but they’re the ones who put out all the names of the donors. The double game of bribery and disciplining only works if the names are public, and it certainly wouldn’t do for Trump to pay for his own ballroom out of a $230 million extortion from the Justice Department; that wouldn’t leave any room to demand tribute from the corporate sector. More from David Dayen The result is among the most corrupt displays in American history, with a president agreeing to do corporations’ bidding in exchange for financing a personal shrine and staying aligned for the duration of his presidency. We’ve seen other instances of personal self-aggrandizement and favor-trading, from pardoning convicted felons who partner with his crypto company to handing out contracts to businesses linked to his family to letting personal friends and patrons fund the Defense Department. (That’s all just in the last week!) But the ballroom is literally being built on a foundation of corruption, as a monument to it, on the very grounds of the White House. Which raises the question: What do all these companies in on the ground floor, so to speak, really want? Most of the companies that officially donated to the Trump ballroom have been in the Prospect’s crosshairs for some time, and in going back through our archives we can divine why they’re debasing themselves to play this corrupt game. Here’s a rundown: The first thing that jumps off the page is that the nation’s five largest tech companies—Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft—are all on the donor list. Google’s money comes from a settlement with Trump for taking him off YouTube after January 6th. Even before this, Trump had been the tech industry’s personal lobbyist abroad, shaking down foreign nations to drop their taxes and regulations on U.S. tech firms in trade deals. Trump’s attorney general was an Amazon lobbyist. And he exempted Apple from tariffs after getting a ridiculous statue from CEO Tim Cook. So why are these firms giving cash to someone who already is serving them well? That’s simple: ongoing maintenance. Google has been found liable for being a monopoly on multiple occasions in Justice Department cases; there’s an imminent ruling on its advertising technology business after Obama-appointed judge Amit Mehta delivered a light remedy on Google’s search monopoly. Meta recently wrapped up a trial in a monopolization case against the Federal Trade Commission, and a ruling is expected shortly; Apple and Amazon face monopolization lawsuits against the government as well, and Apple has lost private antitrust litigation. All of these cases could be withdrawn or settled by the president. In addition, all of these companies are spending fantastic sums in the global AI race. They need a government that will weaken state regulations and allow data centers to be built nationwide, as well as being willing to provide a backstop if the AI stock bubble collapses. (NextEra Energy, which is also a donor, is resurrecting an Iowa nuclear facility to power a Google data center; it will help to have the government in its corner.) There’s evidence that Meta’s appeasement of the Chinese government actually facilitated that country’s AI developments; Apple is exposed on aiding Chinese tech’s superpower status as well. Buying Trump’s loyalty helps him overlook these betrayals. Finally, Amazon is in the midst of trying to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional, and wants to keep the Trump administration out of that fight. Like with Big Tech, the crypto industry has already made its purchase of the inner sanctums of the government. Trump is literally a crypto mogul; his administration is allowing crypto in 401(k) plans and potentially as collateral for mortgages; nearly all of the overlapping civil and criminal investigations against crypto companies have been withdrawn; and Congress passed a stablecoin law that eases up on regulation and could facilitate private currencies. It is party time in the crypto world. Among the ballroom donors are Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether. Among individual donors are the Winklevoss twins, who own the crypto exchange Gemini, and Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also a donor; he made his fortune running Cantor Fitzgerald, which was the banker for Tether. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Again, this is about ongoing maintenance and future results. Coinbase and Ripple have been among the largest crypto spenders in politics since the 2024 elections. The Winklevoss twins recently interceded to get Trump to change his choice to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which the industry wants to become the lead digital assets regulator. But they need market structure legislation to make that happen, and Congress is in turmoil. Spending on the ballroom could be a way to go back to Trump and get him to pressure his Republican underlings to pass what the industry wants. Crypto titans also want the barely-alive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make it easier for customers to move their money out of banks and to their apps; that requires more quid pro quo relationships with D.C. power brokers. It may have been jarring to see printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard on the list. It’s a pretty Democratic firm in terms of campaign spending. But one of its business lines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, has been in the news lately. HPE successfully got a merger approved with Juniper Networks that the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division initially challenged. It turned out that HPE paid MAGA lobbyists to get top DOJ officials to overrule the Antitrust Division, in what ousted Antitrust Division officials later described as rank pay-to-play corruption. There’s likely to be a forthcoming judicial proceeding about the merger, which could reveal some very unseemly things about HPE. They’re likely paying Trump to try to keep a lid on this scandal. In addition, HPE’s dominance in enterprise networks could see them soar in the data center building boom, so keeping Trump happy makes sense there as well. Separately, Blackstone, the private equity firm run by ballroom donor Stephen Schwarzman, just announced an $18.3 billion deal alongside TPG to take mammogram rollup Hologic private, which presumably Schwarzman wants the government to approve. One decidedly old-school donor on the list was Union Pacific. But in July, the company announced a historic $85 billion proposed merger with Norfolk Southern, which would for the first time in American history put one company in control of a railroad that can travel coast-to-coast. Even Jay Gould couldn’t get a single transcontinental railroad done during the first Gilded Age. But Union Pacific’s dream would touch 43 states, and end the gentlemen’s agreement whereby two Eastern and two Western railroads split up the country. That merger needs to be approved … by the Trump administration’s Surface Transportation Board. So you get the picture here. Throwing down millions of dollars for a ballroom is a small price to pay for monopolizing freight rail commerce. One old-school member of the military-industrial complex showed up on the list, as did one new-school member. Lockheed Martin is in line for at least some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new contracts available after Congress topped up military spending in the Big Beautiful Bill. Palantir thinks it can get a substantial share of that money as part of the defense tech push, as well as funding for surveillance operations at the border. Meanwhile, national-security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton gave to the ballroom, an indicator of the continuing drift of rule by contractor in the Trump era. Sharp-eyed Prospect readers were sure to notice the presence of José and Emilia Fanjul on the list. The Fanjul dynasty, as we reported last month, has been a dominant fixture in American life since the 19th century, cleaning up in the sugar industry with favorable rules and tariff structures and the like. When Trump secured a deal with Coca-Cola to produce their soft drink with cane sugar, he was enriching the Fanjuls. And keeping sugar flowing from their plantation in the Dominican Republic that employs something approaching forced labor, which Trump secured with a quiet regulatory change this year, is a top priority. There are a few individual donors who are closely associated with the companies they run. Stephen Schwarzman and Blackstone have tons of business before the federal government, from housing to AI, and Pam Bondi was also that company’s lobbyist. The Adelson family has essentially dictated Trumpian policy in the Middle East. Fracking mogul Harold Hamm is a close associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and helped map out the administration’s energy policy. A little extra for the ballroom helps keep that on the right path. It was interesting to see cigarette manufacturers Altria and R.J. Reynolds International on the list. Cigarette companies’ stocks did fall when Trump’s Food and Drug Administration kept e-cigarettes on shelves in July. Altria once had a significant investment in Juul, the top e-cigarette maker, but divested in 2023. So maybe this is just a pitch for Big Sin to get back in the game with the administration. Less puzzling is the role of Caterpillar, the farm machinery manufacturer. Trouble in the agricultural sector is a direct threat to Caterpillar’s bottom line; a little investment in Trumpian relations to get better outcomes than a farm bailout (whereby farmers are paid not to produce, and therefore not use Caterpillar equipment) is in order. Caterpillar also has a big plant in Mexico that has been alleged to have committed significant labor violations; maybe this is buying off Trump to look the other way at an America Last company. Finally, your guess is as good as mine as to why Hard Rock International appears here. Maybe Trump has an old friend at Hard Rock from his casino days; or maybe Hard Rock wants the concession contract, or a few slot machines in the gilt-edged foyer. But there’s one more option; Hard Rock is among the firms trying to win a New York City license to install a casino in one of the five boroughs. Trump doesn’t have much clout in New York, but I guess every bit of leverage helps, should Trump decide to trade funding for a rail tunnel for a casino license for his favorite pals. Logan Chapman contributed reporting. We’re entering the final stretch of our fall fundraising campaign, and a generous reader has offered a $15,000 match to help us close the gap. Every dollar you give this week will be doubled. Independent media like The American Prospect stands as one of the last defenses against authoritarianism. Meanwhile, the rest of the media landscape keeps consolidating—gobbled up by billionaires who see news as another tool to accumulate more wealth and power. We’re beholden to no one but our readers, and that independence is exactly what your donation protects. If you believe in journalism that exposes power rather than serves it, now’s the time to give.

Stocks rallied to more records Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events. The S&P 500 rose 83.47 points, or 1.2%, to 6,875.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.47 points, or 0.7%, to 47,544.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 432.59 points, or 1.9%, to 23,637.46. Stocks also climbed to strong gains in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the leaders of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, the AP reports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's "a framework" for President Trump and Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, "We feel good" about working things out with China.

All the optimism flowing through financial markets helped knock down the price of gold. The metal's price has stalled after it nearly touched $4,400 per ounce last week, when it set its latest record. It's dipped back toward $4,000, but it's still up more than 50% for the year so far.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.69cv9ktuy Share article Print article Over the past few years, markets have been on a wild ride. The price of gold has soared to record highs. Bitcoin is trading above US$100,000 (about A$150,000), at levels that once seemed unthinkable. Hype about artificial intelligence (AI) has put a rocket under tech stocks. US chip maker Nvidia is worth more than Australia’s entire stock market combined. Obviously, this doesn’t tell us anything about where these investments are headed in the future. There are now even widespread concerns AI investment may be driving a bubble. Still, if you did have a time machine, what would be the best way to go back and invest some cash? We’ve crunched the numbers on a range of popular investment options to see how they have performed since 2010. The results might surprise you. Let’s imagine you had A$1,000 burning a hole in your pocket back in 2010. The global financial crisis was still fresh on everyone’s minds, and the investment world was a different place. But maybe you had just received a tax refund, or sold your old car. So, where should you have put that money? By now, that $1,000 could be worth anywhere from $1,428 if you left it in a savings account, to a mind-boggling $466.8 million if you’d invested in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is a bit of a special case, so we’ll come back to that later. The Australian share market delivered solid returns. Investing in the ASX 200 – the top 200 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) – would have turned $1,000 into $3,446 (with dividends reinvested). That’s a 245% total return. Putting it in gold, often considered a “safe haven” investment, would have returned $4,201. Then comes the standout: US shares. Investing in the S&P 500 would have transformed $1,000 into $10,851 – more than triple the return on Australian shares. Even that remarkable figure pales beside a more concentrated bet – the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, Meta (owner of Facebook), Tesla and Nvidia. These stocks now account for about 40% of the S&P 500 index and have driven much of its recent strong performance. We can’t measure their performance from all the way back in 2010, because Meta (Facebook) only listed publicly on the US share market in 2012. However, Bloomberg data allows us to reliably track their performance as a basket of stocks since 2015. From that point in time, investing in these stocks would have turned that same $1,000 into $26,074 by today. That’s nearly two and a half times better than the broader S&P 500 since 2010 and more than seven times the ASX 200’s performance. The Magnificent Seven’s outperformance reveals why the overall strength of US shares isn’t just about US companies being better investments – it’s about which sectors and companies dominated global innovation and market returns over this period. The S&P 500 would have given you more than 600% over 15 years in US dollar terms with dividends reinvested. This is impressive, but after you translate the US dollar returns into Australian dollars, you get a return of 985%. That’s because the Australian dollar fell from parity with the US dollar in 2010 to about 65 US cents now. That’s a 35% depreciation that turbocharged returns on US investments. Every US dollar of gains converts back to significantly more Australian dollars today than it did in 2010. Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room. Theoretically, A$1,000 invested when Bitcoin traded around 37 Australian cents in late 2010 could have grown to approximately $466.8 million by now. That’s a whopping 46,682,249% return. However, cryptocurrency investors faced immense challenges over this period. They had to navigate a market with a catastrophic failure rate, where nearly 40% of all coins from 2014–2021 were delisted – mostly as a total 100% loss. Even though Bitcoin appears more resilient than other cryptocurrencies, it has endured intense volatility. It saw annual price swings of over 100% between 2010 and 2015. Cryptocurrency exchange collapses – such as the 2014 failure of Mt. Gox, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin – highlight the vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure. Here is the sobering news: leaving your money in a typical savings account would have seen it grow to just $1,428. That is only 45% growth over 15 years. Savings accounts were paying reasonable interest (although the rate had been declining) until the COVID pandemic, when savings rates plummeted to just 0.5%. When you account for inflation, money in savings accounts has actually lost purchasing power. An investor who turned $1,000 into $10,851 in US shares simply diversified internationally, held steady through multiple crises, and benefited from both asset appreciation and currency depreciation. They didn’t need perfect timing or insider knowledge, just patience and perspective. In an era of unprecedented market concentration, that patient, diversified approach matters more than ever. The best investment strategy isn’t about finding the next Bitcoin. It’s about building a portfolio that captures returns wherever they emerge globally.

Qualcomm stock just soared 19% — its biggest jump in over a year. The reason? Qualcomm announced new AI accelerator chips, the AI200 and AI250, built to rival Nvidia and AMD in powering AI data centers. With a $182 billion market cap and entry into a $6.7 trillion AI infrastructure boom, Qualcomm is no longer just a smartphone chipmaker — it’s going all-in on energy-efficient AI hardware that could redefine the next era of AI computing. Analysts broadly see Qualcomm's stock as a moderate buy with significant upside potential.

The rapid rise of the fintech sector in India has enabled Indian investors to explore investment opportunities overseas, especially in booming markets like the United States. Global equities have become more accessible for Indian investors due to the proliferation of Portfolio Management Services (PMS), global trading platforms and fintech apps. As the US stocks have reached record highs in the last few days, it could be an opportune time for Indian investors to gain from the booming US market. Indian investors can explore a wide range of options from stocks of top global tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta to popular ETFs and index funds. The key US stock indices reached record high levels on Friday, after the potential China trade deal progress and anticipation of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow closed above 47,000 for the first time on Friday after September’s Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation had heated up but less than expected, as per a CNN report. Key indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, also rallied to new record highs on Oct. 24. The S&P 500 Index rose by 0.79% while the Dow Jones Industrials Index rallied1.01%. On the other hand, the Nasdaq 100 Index advanced 1.04%. Amid the boom in the US market, Indian investors can explore the opportunities to reap benefits through the new-age digital trading platforms that offer simple and secure ways to invest in US equities. · To start investing in US stocks, Indian investors need to follow a few simple steps: · Open a global trading account with a registered brokerage firm · Complete the KYC verification by submitting documents like identity proof, address proof, PAN and bank account details. · Some trading platforms may also ask for additional documents for compliance and legal requirements. · Once the account is set up, you can add funds and start trading in American stocks. Many international brokers are also offering overseas trading accounts for Indian investors. · Access to top global companies across industries offers an opportunity to minimise risks through diversification, while maximising returns from their growth. · Exposure to US stocks may help to minimise risks during a downturn in domestic markets. · Many brokers are allowing the opening of free trading accounts for Indian investors. · Investments in American stocks can be made starting at as little as $10. · For long-term investors, investments at regular intervals also minimise risks due to the advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Before investing in US stocks, it’s important for Indian investors to know about regulatory restrictions, compliance norms and transaction-related guidelines. Currency exchange rates and capital gains taxes could also reduce your actual returns from the US stocks. Tax compliance in both countries could be a tedious task for many investors. Market volatilities arising from global economic factors and geopolitical issues could also pose a serious risk for investors. It’s also advisable to consistently monitor currency exchange rates as they can impact the overall value of your portfolio in rupee terms. To conclude, Indian investors can easily access American stocks with today’s tech-driven trading platforms. It’s advisable to take a balanced approach and remain watchful of all key factors while ensuring compliance as per Indian laws and RBI rules for seamless investing.

Title: Exit dialogue: What would you consider a decent severance pay?

She rolled her eyes. Pay discussions are sensitive, but easier when you do it before joining, hence I ignored her non-friendly body language and pursued, “I mean, if you terminate me in the first year, will there be a special severance pay?” That conversation went on for another 45 minutes without leading to any conclusion, and she then had to pass it on to her CEO for a resolution. Are you wondering why I was spoiling my chances of being employed as a CEO? I had my reasons — the risk factors were big. The enterprise in question had the dubious distinction of asking two people before me to leave in the first year of appointment; and, if anointed, I would have been their fifth leader in seven years. I had asked for a year’s compensation if my employment contract were to be ended by the organisation in the first year. They didn’t have a formal retrenchment policy and were hence hesitant. Well, that was more than 15 years ago; today, most progressive organisations have a formal retrenchment policy, and the formulas are fixed. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), several countries offer some sort of a redundancy pay. The ILO’s Employment Protection Legislation (EPLex) database covers 116 countries, and lists the severance pay in months, based on tenure. Guess where India features in this? You will be surprised to note that India, along with countries like Japan, is at the top of the list, recommending 20 months of severance pay for employees serving 20 years. However, countries like the US, which dish out attractive severances to their ousted CEOs, recommend nothing, as per the ILO database. In a way, for every year of service, one month of severance pay is considered acceptable. According to the website TrueUp, which tracks tech layoffs, May and July saw the most number of layoffs — 24,000 and 46,000, respectively. It says the layoffs at tech companies have impacted 158,993 people so far in 2025. That’s about 541 people per day. Sounds like a lot? But then, if you compare with 2024, it was about 653 per day. All of us criticise enterprises that lay off people. But does it affect their brand worth? We know Wall Street rewards headcount reduction and even CEO firings. Remember, the stock price of Starbucks went up by 20 per cent when it replaced the last CEO. Let’s name the 10 brands that laid off employees in 2025 and ask ourselves whether we would be willing to recommend our near and dear ones to work there in the future? According to the platform Intellizence, leading companies that announced layoffs in 2025 include UPS (20,000), Dell (12,000), Nissan (12,000), Intel (10,000), HBC (8,300), Chevron (8,000), DHL (8,000), BP (7,700) and Audi (7,500). As per company filings cited by Bloomberg, Reliance Retail laid off 38,000 employees in 2024. Will anyone refuse to join these enterprises if they are recruiting again? We know severance pay is a question of intent and affordability for an enterprise. When Meta laid off 11,000 employees in 2022, the company paid $975 million in severance, about $88,000 per person on average. In a subsequent regulatory filing, the Facebook parent said “the impact of these costs was not material” as it was offset by what it saved in payroll and other employee benefits. A Bloomberg review of Russell 3000 companies that made layoffs between 2022 and 2024 showed that, on average, each laid-off worker received a severance pay of $40,000. The report also highlighted an extreme example of a healthcare company with an average payout of almost $212,000 per laid-off worker. Back home, when TCS recently announced its severance package for the 12,000-odd employees it intends to lay off, most of us termed the offer as generous. According to reports, affected employees will be offered a minimum of six months’ pay while those who have served 20 years will be given two years’ pay. Would you prefer a six-month or two-year salary paid upfront, rather than continuing with your job? It may depend on your personal and professional context. What if you don’t get your next job within the next six months? After 20 years in a single company that laid you off for want of better skills, what are the chances of getting a suitable job in two years? One can call the severance pay attractive if the laid-off person is able to secure a job before the money runs out. A severance paycheque is a ticking time bomb till you get your next job offer. Picture this: one gets a job well in time, and there is a handsome additional amount in the bank after getting laid off, thanks to the severance pay. Will you trade the money in the bank for feeling unwanted by your former employer? Are the uncertainties you had to go through, the anxieties, and the feeling of rejection caused during the redundancy period worth the money you received in the end? Let’s face it — in today’s world, the scars of layoffs are inevitable. Let’s believe that the scars show us where we have been and don’t dictate where we are going!

Title: If you don't love the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses, you won't like smart glasses, period

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Ray-Ban (Gen 2) glasses don't make major changes, but they didn't need to: It's still the best way to capture candid shots of your day or analyze your environment with your phone in your pocket, only with enough battery life so that you no longer have to worry they'll die mid-outing. Meta eventually wants true "all-day" glasses that record and respond to everything you see; these Gen 2 glasses aren't there yet, but they're getting closer. Major battery life upgrade Variety of styles, colors, and lenses for everyone High-res photos and stabilized action videos Contextual Meta AI insights Promise of regular post-launch updates Still too thick and heavy for non-techies Not as water-resistant as Vanguards No HUD Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When I reviewed the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I explained how much I liked them, but that others might skip them because of the Meta connection and privacy concerns. Instead, they became the world's best-selling smart glasses. Ray-Ban/Oakley maker EssilorLuxottica is thriving thanks to AI glasses sales, on target to make 10 million units next year to meet demand. My Gen 2 review will focus on two types of people: the millions of Gen 1 buyers wondering whether these new glasses are enough to justify an upgrade, and smart glasses skeptics wondering whether to hop on the Ray-Ban train. For the first group, the Gen 2-to-Gen 1 gap is subtle, with some problems addressed and others unresolved. But just as Meta transformed the Gen 1s with Meta AI and Live AI months after launch, the best is yet to come for the Gen 2s — if you're patient. For smart glasses skeptics, I'll help you decide whether these Ray-Bans can replace your current combination of normal (sun)glasses, earbuds, and smartphone cameras. It'll come down to your personal style as much as hardware, but you probably won't like any current smart glasses if these are too thick or heavy for you. Style Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) Frame colors Shiny Cosmic Blue, Matte Black, Shiny Black Shiny Mystic Violet, Shiny Chalky Gray, Shiny Black Shiny Asteroid Grey, Matte Black, Shiny Black Lens colors Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15*, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses ship in three styles, each with multiple colors and lens options. Wayfarers have Standard or Large frame sizes to accommodate larger heads; Headliners have High and Low bridges. Skyler frames are one-size-fits-all. All styles and lens types let you add a prescription, though only through Meta or Ray-Ban directly. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler all start at $379 — $80 higher than the Gen 1 glasses. You'll pay $30 or $80 for Polarized or Transitions lenses, respectively. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Buying from Ray-Ban directly unlocks unique Transitions lens colors like Amethyst, Ruby, or Sapphire, Polarized colors like Dark Brown, extra-thin lenses for stronger prescriptions, and an "optimized" anti-reflective layer to combat smudges and oils.

Most of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) perks will be old news to Gen 1 owners, but are still worth explaining to new buyers. When I go out for a solo walk, run, hike, or round of golf, I think about wearing my Ray-Bans. They give me rich speakers for music or audiobooks to keep me motivated as I work out. I can snap first-person-perspective photos with a quick tap of the right temple button, and the five-mic array helps my voice come through crystal clear during phone calls. At any time, I can say, "Hey Meta," and have the AI explain what plant species I'm looking at, set a reminder for where I parked, check my next appointment in Google Calendar, start playing a specific song or playlist, or message a family member. None of this is all that different from what you can do with a smartphone and earbuds, and they won't function without a phone. But it's a convenient combo package. The design isn't perfect, but the EssilorLuxottica partnership couldn't have worked out any better for Meta. The Ray-Ban manufacturer tapped its design expertise to make these glasses look normal (if thick) with dozens of variations; other tech brands can't offer this variety or leverage in-person glasses stores for fittings. The Wayfarers are the default look, boxy and a bit generic to "blend in" the most, while the rounded-edge Headliners and Skylers soften the thick-framed look somewhat. Whichever style you choose, I recommend splurging on the Transitions lenses. I don't use them indoors that often, but if I'm out for a long activity, they give me good eye protection to start and then switch to clear once the sun goes down. As I wrote in my Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 first impressions, longer battery life is their most important upgrade. The old version had a 4-hour max but rarely lasted that long, and doubling the max capacity without the glasses getting noticeably heavier is worth praising. I've never hit Meta's eight-hour estimate, but only because I tend to use the Gen 2s heavily: nonstop music streaming, plenty of 3K videos, and Meta AI commands. Meta's five-hour estimate with music aligns with my experience, about 20% per hour while using all the main features. Whenever I've gone out and only taken photos or asked Meta a few questions, it's much closer to the 12.5%/hour that Meta promises, with little battery use while idling. But with frequent videos or livestreaming, you'll burn through battery quickly. - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Gen 1 - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN - Oakley Meta Vanguard vs. Oakley Meta HSTN Camera quality from the 12MP ultrawide sensor hasn't changed since the Gen 1 glasses, and my thoughts from 2023 apply to the Gen 2s. Meta's camera is excellent at catching moving targets or adjusting to your movement; I've taken great shots while running. It captures a ton of detail, but no wayfinder means you'll have trouble knowing what you're actually photographing or how close to stand. Your height will also affect things; as a tall guy, I need to squat for the best close-up angle. Meta wants you to upload these directly to Instagram, but I find they usually need cropping and magic erasing in Google Photos first. Meta's post-processing tends to oversaturate photos, and Magic Eraser removes the unnecessary details. Be prepared to accept some trade-offs. Night photography is blurry, even with artificial light sources, and you won't find any alternative "modes" like portrait that blur things behind your subject. For natural, on-the-go, quick-snap photography, they're excellent; I can capture things I'd usually miss if I had to pull out my phone first. I just hope that by the Gen 3 release in a few years, we'll get landscape photography, a shortcut button to zoom in for faraway subjects, and other improvements. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses have the same video settings: 1080p or 3K at 30 FPS. Meta also says it'll eventually support 1200p at 60 FPS, but that setting still hasn't arrived as of late October. You can see the Oakley video test above from Android Central's Nick Sutrich showing how the new 3K video setting compares to 1080p on the Gen 1s. My findings are similar to his: 3K HDR videos give you more detail, better contrast, and less compression than the 1080p setting, especially in well-lit areas; in dimly lit rooms or at night, Ray-Ban videos are blurry and dull on either setting. For mobile videos — like recording while running a half-marathon — the 1080p setting is better, while 3K is distractingly shaky. Meta gave its sporty Vanguard glasses a smoother 60 FPS mode and customizable stabilization tools, so I'm assuming the Ray-Bans will get those soon. My mom loved testing out my Ray-Ban Meta glasses; she went around her garden asking about every type of plant and taking photos. But after the novelty wore off, she handed them back and said she'd never wear them long-term because they're too big, both physically and aesthetically. I think plenty of people will agree with her that the thickness needed to fit the cameras, mics, and battery is very distinct, and might not fit their vibe. Meta will eventually have to pull off glasses that weigh slightly less if people are going to wear them all day, not just for outings. I recommend trying them on at a local glasses or electronics store if you're uncertain. You'll have to decide if their 50g weight is oppressive and which size to choose. I find the Standard fit is more secure but digs deeper into my nose, while the Large fit is more comfortable but tends to drift down my face when I walk or run. Smart glasses have become much more mainstream, and the Gen 2 design blends in more than most XR glasses. But people outside the tech sphere still dislike wearable cameras that can start recording without warning, even with the white LED to warn them. Some first-gen nitpicks have returned this generation, like the Ray-Ban logo being distractingly visible in the right lens, or Meta AI not being able to change glasses settings, only telling you where to look. You'll have to accept the noticeable audio spill; at the volume necessary to hear your music clearly, anyone else nearby will hear it, too. And I'd like Meta to add different audio profiles tailored to specific types of music (aka a bass mode) or to audiobooks and podcasts. Lastly, as I said earlier, Meta tread water on photography this generation, and I'd like to see improvements by next generation: A portrait/ landscape toggle, optional zoom, better postprocessing, or other tricks. If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. the Oakley Meta HSTN, you'll find they're virtually identical in hardware, differing only in style and Prizm lenses. But the Oakleys are theoretically tough competition if you prefer their aesthetic to Ray-Ban. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are more substantially upgraded: you get an extra hour of battery life, louder speakers, IP67 water resistance, and a more centered camera cutout. But they don't blend in like Ray-Bans, they have no Transitions or prescription options, and they're heavier — though the nose pads keep them in place. Then you have to compare the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses against the Gen 2s. Pay twice as much, and you get a built-in HUD for unique apps — map navigation, watching videos, reading messages, etc. — a viewfinder for better photography, and a neural band for gesture controls. But these glasses are notably thicker and heavier, available only in one style and two colors, and in limited stock. You should buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... You shouldn't buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... Smart glasses newbies will either like the Ray-Ban style, easy photography, and AI insights, or get scared off by their size. The real question is whether Gen 1 or Stories owners will see enough to upgrade. Aside from battery life, the Gen 2 Ray-Bans won't feel that different from the last generation, but only because Meta has spent two years updating the Gen 1s. They didn't even launch with Meta AI, yet it's now the signature feature. We already know they'll get slow-motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin integration, better video recording, and one-word commands like "Photo" by the end of 2025. And that should be just the start. Just look at Meta's AI glasses release notes — with eight feature updates so far in 2025 — to see what to expect. Ultimately, you won't find other display-free glasses that balance AI smarts, camera and speaker quality, and classic style so well, and I think Meta has done enough to tempt you to upgrade. However, if you're not convinced, check back in a few months — they might be even better by then. Familiar tools, upgraded The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses have arrived with enhanced battery life, UHD video, and new styles to tempt long-time fans into upgrading. Unless an alternative Oakley style or the Display HUD really tempt you, you won't find a proper smart glasses rival to them. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

It's gotta be the shoes! Why else would people be willing to drop at least $1,100 on a pair of sneakers? I'd never shell out that much but I am tempted to go try on Wall Street's favorite pair of kicks. On the agenda today: But first: Are you leaving the money on the table? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Imagine you work for a company and your stock price has just skyrocketed. Think Nvidia, up more than 1,100% over the past few years to become a $4.5 trillion company. Or Broadcom and AMD, two other chipmakers whose shares are surging in the AI boom. Employees of these companies must be feeling pretty good right about now. What could possibly go wrong? As is often the case, though, there is a catch. In this instance, it's known as "golden handcuffs" — the notion of feeling stuck because it's too risky or expensive to move or change. These compensation packages often include restricted stock units, or RSUs. Those who decide to leave their companies could forfeit any unvested stock, meaning they could miss out on a substantial form of compensation — potentially worth millions of dollars. My colleagues Geoff Weiss, Hugh Langley, and Rosalie Chan wrote this weekend about the latest golden handcuff trend sweeping through Silicon Valley, particularly at the AI chip companies. In one case, they reported that an equity package of $420,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is worth almost $2 million today, citing data from Levels.fyi. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $267,000. Stock payouts unlock over time. Quitting before shares vest can potentially mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. Although, it's worth noting that if you quit or lose your job, those unvested RSUs disappear. Companies use restricted stock as a retention tactic. It's one that has been utilized from Wall Street to Big Tech, with a similar dynamic now occurring in the AI boom. Consider the employee churn rates at these chipmakers. Nvidia said in its annual sustainability report that its turnover rate has been cut in half over the past few years, adding that "RSUs promote retention." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy. Similarly, Broadcom said its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive." This is the conundrum for chipmaker employees right now. Walk away and forfeit millions for a new opportunity? Or stay? For the last 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg has been the world's Minister of Thought. Starting with Facebook, the Meta CEO has transformed how we view ourselves and each other. Now, Zuckerberg appears to be ceding that title to OpenAI's Sam Altman. ChatGPT is only three years old and has more than 800 million weekly users — about 40 times more than Facebook's audience during its first three years. If the past two decades were about curating who we are, the future may be about creating who we want to be. From pokes to prompts. Dimitri Semenikhin is the 29-year-old day trader whose thesis helped spark a massive rally in Beyond Meat. The day trader is a Moscow native who lived in Monaco and was schooled in London. He previously launched a luxury travel startup called Yacht Harbour, and is currently the CEO of his family's real-estate development firm. And while he's leaned into it at times, he said he's not Roaring Kitty 2.0. What makes Semenikhin and Beyond different. At the video-game giant Electronic Arts, management is gung-ho on AI. Workers, on the other hand, say AI is actually making their jobs harder — and they fear it could be game over if they're training their replacement. AI has been a part of video games for some time: when you play "Madden" you're competing against a computer-controlled team, for instance. But the modern AI affecting game design is different, and it's widening the gap between bosses and employees. Player v. player.

Title: Meta Is Set to Report Earnings on Wednesday—What You Need to Know

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which boosted its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.55 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.70 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Wednesday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 16% upside from Tuesday's close. The stock has added 28% of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). UPDATE—Oct. 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values and analyst estimates.

Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to
