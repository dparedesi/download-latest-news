ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. This photograph shows macaron pastries with the Snapchat logo during the inauguration of Snapchat ... More France headquarters in Paris on May 19, 2025. (Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP) (Photo by JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images) Snap (NYSE: SNAP) stock has fallen more than 20% this year. In fact, the stock has decreased over 50% from its peak in July of last year. It was trading at around $8 per share at the close of the market yesterday. This recent poor performance can be linked to the absence of second-quarter guidance, worries about how macroeconomic conditions are impacting advertising demand, and slower-than-expected revenue growth, particularly in key segments. The current question is – could it decline further—by another 25-30%? What if it drops to 50%, reaching $4 levels? Well, here’s the issue: even at about $8 per share, the stock isn’t inexpensive. It is valued at nearly 35 times its cash flow over the last twelve months. If we invert that figure, it results in a cash flow yield of roughly 2.9% (the ratio of cash flow to price). By comparison, Meta Platforms trades at just 17 times cash flow. Furthermore, Meta is a leader in social networking platforms and has consistently achieved 13% revenue growth over the past few years, in contrast to 9% for SNAP. Is a 35x multiple genuinely warranted for SNAP? What you are willing to pay is significant. We have developed the Trefis High Quality Portfolio with a focus on relative valuation. Notably, HQ has recorded over 91% return since its inception and has outperformed the S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow — all of them. Separately, see – Nvidia Stock’s 1 Big Risk Although Snap’s average revenue growth of 9% over the past three years is relatively modest, and its -13% net margins are inferior to most companies in the Trefis coverage universe, there's a crucial factor influencing its valuation. Snap has notably increased its user base, with daily active users rising from 319 million in 2021 to 460 million currently. This steady user growth has historically been rewarded by the market. The company's appeal to advertisers comes from its primary target audience: younger demographics (Gen Z and Millennials). These groups are particularly appealing due to their significant future spending potential and engagement with emerging trends, prompting investors to pay a premium for access to this valuable audience. While Snap may continue to grow its user base in the short term, the critical challenge lies in enhancing its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Failure to achieve this could result in a slowdown in revenue growth. Moreover, the company is currently not profitable, and the necessity to integrate AI into its offerings may further strain its already tight margins. As a result, Snap’s valuation should reflect that of companies experiencing 5-10% revenue growth, assuming it can even maintain that level. In stark contrast to Snap, Meta is a more stable, resilient, and deeply entrenched entity. Its dominance is “embedded” in the essential ways people socialize, communicate, and consume digital content. Meta currently trades at about 17 times cash flow while delivering 13% annual growth. If Snap were valued at a comparable 17x cash flow multiple, its share price would drop to around $4, representing another 50% decline. Could Snap’s multiple even fall below the 17x commanded by Meta? Ultimately, the choice of how much you are ready to pay for SNAP is up to you. Snap’s dependence on digital advertising, especially from sectors like consumer goods, entertainment, retail, and tech services, offers a potential silver lining. There’s always the chance that advertising expenditures will recover. Historically, when economic conditions improve and consumer confidence rises, marketing budgets are among the first to expand. This occurs because companies typically increase advertising spending when they’re optimistic about future sales growth, planning new product launches, or actively competing for market share. If advertising activities and volumes increase, Snap’s revenues are likely to follow. There’s considerable pent-up demand from brands that scaled back their advertising efforts during recent economic uncertainty. Importantly, Snap may not need to significantly elevate its ad prices; it mainly requires a boost in advertiser activity to drive its revenue growth. Comparing SNAP with Meta is essential for understanding the risk-reward profile of investing in Snap. Effective investment decisions rely on gauging relative attractiveness. The central question is: should you invest in SNAP stock, maintain interest-earning cash to avoid market risk, or perhaps choose an S&P 500 ETF? How much higher is the expected return on SNAP stock compared to cash, and what downside risk must be accepted for that potential gain? Utilizing a specific “anchor” asset like Meta Platforms provides a strong framework for assessing this risk-reward dynamic. Note: Choose comparisons wisely. SNAP is currently a “high valuation” stock. When a company trades at around 35x Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF), anchoring it against Meta offers essential perspective. Meta, with more reasonable multiples, often makes a more compelling investment case than Snap. Regardless of the trade-off, investing in a single stock can be risky. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500over the last 4 years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the standard index, with a more stable performance observable in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Update font size. Reset The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks have led the market’s recent boom. But as Big Tech motors into the AI future, Apple is dangerously behind and, so far, looks to have little hope of catching up any time soon. Shannon Carroll for Quartz: ‎ While the others — Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla— race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Again, as we’ve been saying for many years now, Apple is suffering a crisis of leadership and is paying the price for having visionless caretaker Tim Cook at the helm for far too long. Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposedly in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. – MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024 You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Another sign of strength; show solid concern for the planet by announcing the company-wide carbon neutrality date will be moved up a year to 2029 (even if December). Maybe some banjo playing by some of the C’s during June’s WWDC? Here’s my guess: Apple is developing their own AI GPU to rival, replace, or mitigate the need for NVIDIA. It’ll take 3-5 years to get there and everyone is holding their breath hoping they can get there before AI goes post singularity and the race is lost. You make a good point there, Jobs always wanted apple to make the whole widget hence the migration from intel to their own version of the ARM architecture and their acquisition of Intel’s modem project. I also think that the importance of AI is overrated. I remember when I would try to keep track of all the stupid answers Siri gave me. That was five years ago, and it hasn’t changed yet. And it hasn’t changed yet. The jury is still out on how much of a money maker AI will be. For now it’s an add-on to most of these products, from the MS Office suite, to Google/Android/Samsung, to X to Meta Ray Bans, all of which I own, subscribe to or have tried. Do we have any hard numbers on AI subscriptions or how much it has boosted device sales? As far as I can tell NVIDIA has been the only clear winner as the seller of hardware that enables AI that POTENTIALLY will be a big deal but so far is still Silicon Valley hype. Super Grok is amazing and I’ve used it for research but it was already part of my X subscription. I don’t see average consumers flocking to this stuff aside from the free versions. Apple is of course way behind but they also aren’t only building commodified AI like its competitors. The main appeal of Apple is a Siri that can work within Apple’s ecosystem, no one else’s AI will ever have access to the coveted Apple user data and no one else has premium consumer hardware to sell the AI on like Apple does. Even this OpenAI, Jony Ive device is going to be tied to a smartphone (iPhone above all) and it will never be allowed to tell you what is coming up on your calendar or make plans based on your data no matter how sophisticated ChatGPT becomes. Apple could be the new Intel. Had it all and missed the next big thing. I do think a potential devise by Jony Ive for Open AI is a real threat to Apple. The fact that Apple can simply delay updates for a year and not think they could ultimately destroy the company is insane. The IO Device from Ives and Open Ai is NOT standalone … it relies on cellphones to be the core for their operation! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Nvidia Revenues Up 69 Percent to $44.1 Billion

Nvidia reported a net income of $18.8 billion on revenues of $44.1 billion in the quarter ending April 27, 2025. Those figures represent gains of 26 percent and 69 percent, respectively, year-over-year (YOY), which is shocking when you consider that U.S. export rules preventing the company from selling some of its products in China went into effect during the quarter. “Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer, a ‘thinking machine’ designed for reasoning, is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. “Global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure, just like electricity and the internet, and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.” Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! "*" indicates required fields Δ Thanks to the new U.S. export rules, Nvidia was hit with a $4.5 billion in charge in early April because of excess inventory and an inability to complete its obligations to customers in China. It sold $4.6 billion in H20 processor products in the quarter, but would have sold another $2.5 billion worth if it weren’t for the new restrictions. Nvidia saw $39.1 billion in revenues from its Data Center business in the quarter, a gain of 73 percent YOY. Gaming and AI PC revenues were $3.8 billion, a record, and up 42 percent YOY. Professional Visualization revenues were $509 million, up 19 percent. And Automotive and Robotics revenues hit $567 million, up 72 percent. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects revenues in the current quarter to be roughly $45 billion, about $8 billion less than would be the case without the China sales restrictions. But Nvidia’s stock price gained 5 percent, with U.S. Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft expected to purchase a combined $345 billion in Nvidia hardware in 2025. Nvidia lashed out at the chaotic, nonsensical trade policies of the United States. “With half of the world’s AI researchers based [in China], the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally,” Mr. Huang said during the firm’s post-earnings conference call. “Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad.” Paul Thurrott is an award-winning technology journalist and blogger with 30 years of industry experience and the author of 30 books.

Title: The CEO of a top AI startup gave a stark warning about the tech's impact on the labor market

Good morning! A federal court ruled President Donald Trump doesn't have the authority to impose some of his tariffs. The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling declared the tariffs would be vacated, throwing a massive wrench into what has been a key piece of Trump's second term. The federal government has filed a notice of appeal on the court's decision. We're also looking at Anthropic's CEO stark warning about the tech's impact on the labor market. What's on deck Markets: The internet has a new favorite meme trade. Tech: Nvidia shows no signs of slowing down amid tariff uncertainty. Business: Elon Musk says his time as a government employee is coming to an end and thanks Trump. But first, AI in the office. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A top AI executive is ringing the alarm bell on … AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and push unemployment to as high as 20% within the next five years. The above might seem like a coy way of touting a product's power in an ultra-competitive space, but Amodei told Axios he has "a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming." Some companies are ready to push the limits of an AI-led workforce. Take Retool, a platform for building AI applications. Its CEO, David Hsu, told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi its clients are asking "How do we get LLMs to actually replace labor?" It wasn't always supposed to be like this. Remember when AI was going to supercharge employees? The tech was going to make us as efficient as possible! Humans and AI — the best collab since peanut butter and jelly. So what happened? AI costs a lot of money to develop, and that's a problem with so much economic uncertainty. Sprinkle in an industry push to increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy, and robots suddenly look much better than humans. The great AI automation comes with risks, though. (And I'm not talking about entrusting your business to a black box you don't really understand.) As BI's Katie Notopoulos recently detailed, the excitement a CEO (and their investors) has over AI adoption isn't always matched by their customer base. Just ask Duolingo. It's not all bad news when it comes to AI. I hate to leave you on such a downer, especially right before a summer Friday. Here are some ways people are making AI work for them. Finally, something for the young developers out there. Plenty of tech executives have said junior coders are an endangered species thanks to AI's programming capabilities. But AWS executive Rory Richardson sees AI giving a big boost to people early in their careers, allowing them to catch up to veteran employees. She's not alone in viewing AI as the great equalizer in the workplace. 1. GameStop made its first-ever crypto investment. Making good on its promise to buy bitcoin, the gaming retailer announced that it purchased 4,710 tokens, which are worth about $510 million. It's the latest company to add bitcoin to its balance sheet. 2. For Wall Street, TACO Tuesday is now every day. Investors are living by a new rule to play the market: TACO, or "Trump Always Chickens Out," the idea that markets can bet on Trump walking back tariff proposals. 3. Wealthy clients wanted. JPMorgan is opening 14 new financial centers across four states, offering highly specialized services to people with at least $750,000 in deposits and investments. It's part of the bank's greater mission to woo the millionaire class. 1. Meta wants to get physical. The tech giant is working on a project to open physical stores and hire retail workers, per an internal communication seen by BI. The plan could boost its hardware products' sales, although it's unclear how many stores Meta might open and when. 2. Apple's playing catch-up in the AI race. Apple has very few of the AI building blocks its competitors enjoy, some of which have been in the making for 25 years. It may need to partner with rivals or make acquisitions to catch up, BI's Alistair Barr writes. 3. Nvidia beat Wall Street's Q1 forecast. The chip giant reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading. However, Nvidia's China sales were hit hard by US export restrictions, and it expects to take $8 billion in losses of H20 chips revenue in Q2. 1. Millennial divorce is here, and it's expensive. Divorce isn't as common among millennials as it was among boomers, but it's much more financially disruptive. It can potentially decimate savings and lock divorcees out of the housing market. Often, women pay the steepest price. 2. Elon Musk's exit from the government. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced on Wednesday his time as a US government employee is coming to an end, and thanked President Trump for the opportunity to "reduce wasteful spending" at DOGE. His announcement came a day after he criticized Trump's "big beautiful bill," saying it undermined DOGE's work. 3. Trump's Big Law losing streak. Federal judges have blocked the Trump administration's executive orders targeting WilmerHale, Jenner & Block, and Perkins Coie, and they're citing Trump's deal with Paul Weiss as an example. Here are five of the sharpest takedowns from judges so far. Costco, Gap, and Best Buy report earnings. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Apple is falling behind its Magnificent 7 rivals. Here's why

The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. While the others — Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late — and quietly. The last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company’s attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. Technology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn’t had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI “companions” that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone’s dominance. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. Read more: Apple’s brutal year keeps getting worse Apple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg’s company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration’s 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026. Apple’s first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple’s crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it’s not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple’s App Store looms large. Wall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth. China has been central to Apple’s strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China’s smartphone market. And Apple can’t even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company’s ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China’s generative AI rules. The company’s struggles in China don’t even take into account the swirling — and massive — economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. On Apple’s last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump’s tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact. Apple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China — pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. But Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump’s Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. Announcements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud — and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy. Yes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn’t been enough. Right now, Apple isn’t losing. It’s just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse.

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human. The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward. But Trump’s tariffs — many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended – hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry’s prospects. Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia’s report for its fiscal first quarter. Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government’s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts. In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter. “Global demand for NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. The performance bolstered Nvidia’s shares, which gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia’s stock price ended Wednesday’s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth. The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology’s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company’s annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years. Wedbush Securities analyst estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia’s chips. Trump’s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia’s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off key market, especially China. In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia’s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil. Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden’s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. In May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

(NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify and certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

Title: Govt To Hold High-Level Meet To Tackle Dark Patterns On Apps

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Union Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi will today address consumer concerns around dark patterns on e-commerce apps at a high-level stakeholder meeting in New Delhi. This meeting aims to identify more effective ways to tackle manipulative design practices used by digital platforms. Companies such as Amazon, Swiggy, Flipkart, Zomato, MakeMyTrip, Meta, WhatsApp, Ola, and Apple will attend the meeting. National Law Universities (NLUs) and Voluntary Consumer Organisations (VCOs) have also been invited to participate. The meeting comes nearly 18 months since the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices. Notified in November 2023, the guidelines identified 13 dark patterns, including basket sneaking, forced action, drip pricing, confirm shaming, and false urgency. Despite notified guidelines from the Government, many platforms have made few visible changes. On Swiggy, users still see a message claiming they saved Rs 9 on delivery. That message appears above a Rs 11.80 platform fee that is added quietly in the bill. The app also nudges users to buy a Swiggy One Lite subscription by promising 10 free deliveries for three months at Rs 15. These tactics rely on presentation and timing to influence decisions. Screenshot from Swiggy showing Rs.9 savings with free delivery, even as Rs 11.80 is charged as platform fee Screenshot from Swiggy prompting users to subscribe to Lite for Rs 15 to get 10 free deliveries for three months MakeMyTrip continues to use fare tiers like Regular and Premium. Phrases such as âYou are missing out on these benefitsâ encourage users to choose a more expensive option. The total cost builds up in stages, reflecting what the CCPA guidelines describe as drip pricing. Screenshot from MakeMyTrip showing tiered fare options like Regular and Premium Elsewhere, Zomato shows how much a user âsavedâ through its Gold membership, even though that discount comes from a paid subscription. A Rs 10 platform fee appears only at the final step before payment. Users are also prompted to donate Rs.4 to Feeding India, a non-profit initiative by Zomato that works to reduce hunger among underserved communities in India. While the donation is optional, it sits in the middle of the billing flow, making it easy to add without much thought. Screenshot showing âYou saved Rs 21 with Gold,â a Rs 10 platform fee added at checkout, and a prompt to donate Rs 4 to Feeding India These small nudges may seem harmless, but they add up. They may play on user hesitation, create confusion, or make it easier to spend without noticing. A study published in 2024 by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) Academy and UI/UX design agency Parallel helps put these design choices in context. The researchers examined more than 12,000 screens across 53 apps, and found that nearly every app studied (98%) contained at least one dark pattern, and each app showed an average of 2.7 such patterns. The study identified the following dark patterns as most prevalent in Indian apps: The CCPA had released the guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices after public consultation, but it removed Clause 8 from the notified guidelines. This clause, which had appeared in the draft version, had stated that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, would apply in case of any guideline violations. This gap allows platforms to continue using dark patterns without facing legal consequences. While some may view these as common interface choices, they raise questions about how far design can go in guiding user behaviour before it becomes misleading. At the high-level stakeholder meeting held later in the day, Union Consumer Affairs Minister urged companies to conduct internal self-audits and proactively remove dark patterns from their platforms. âCompanies must not wait for the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to intervene. They should proactively recognise and remove these deceptive practices before notices are issued. This is not just regulatory compliance but itâs about building trust with your consumers,â the Minister said. Officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs highlighted a surge in consumer complaints about dark patterns on the National Consumer Helpline (NCH). They also showcased digital tools developed earlier through the Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon 2023 in collaboration with IIT-BHU. These include the Jagriti App, which enables consumers to report dark patterns; the Jago Grahak Jago App, which offers real-time safety scores for e-commerce links; and the Jagriti Dashboard, which generates analytical reports on platforms under the CCPAâs scrutiny. Officials also noted that companies who took the Safety Pledge on National Consumer Day 2024 are expected to uphold that commitment. They said that continued use of dark patterns infringes the pledge. The meeting brought platforms and regulators back to the table, but for users, it leaves a critical question unanswered: if companies are still relying on these design tricks 18 months after the guidelines were issued, what action will the government take next? The ASCI study confirmed that dark patterns are not one-off design quirks-they are systemic and widespread, especially in delivery and travel apps that continue to use tactics the government itself has labelled harmful. The guidelines offered a roadmap. The meeting reaffirmed the governmentâs commitment to consumer protection but whether that commitment translates into enforceable rules, legal action, or stronger penalties remains to be seen.

Title: Ad tech’s IPO dreams are stirring again – MNTN just made them look a bit more real

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead For ad tech bosses, the IPO dream is no longer just a late-night fantasy, it’s starting to look like a real possibility. “Look” being the operative word. Nothing’s guaranteed but there is momentum. MNTN’s splashy debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week didn’t just grab attention, it lit a signal flare. Priced at $16 a share on May 21, the company hit the market with a $1.2 billion valuation – right at the top of investor expectations. By Friday, it was already at $28. On Tuesday, it was around $26. “This could be a meaningful moment for the CTV advertising ecosystem, even if MNTN itself is still relatively small in the grand scheme of AdTech,” said Karsten Weide, principal and chief analyst at W Media Research. “They’ve got a few strong things going for them: the backing of Morgan Stanley gives the IPO some institutional credibility, and the cachet of Ryan Reynolds as chief creative officer continues to generate attention well beyond the industry bubble.” But as good as all this sounds for MNTN, its fate is far from sealed. At 16 years old, it’s a veteran in ad tech terms but one that’s trailing behind peers. The Trade Desk and Criteo had already crossed the billion dollar revenue mark by this point in their life cycles. MNTN, by contrast, is pulling in $225 million. “This [the IPO] is a big tell in the market that reinforces the idea that not all ad tech companies are equal in so far as the ones that are doing well are rooted in performance,” said Brian Mandelbaum, CEO of Attain, a consumer data platform focused on outcomes. Here’s a closer look at that tightrope walk, based on the company’s S-1 filing with the SEC. Since 2020, MNTN has posted a tenfold revenue jump and 769% customer growth, riding the momentum of CTV and performance-driven advertising. That’s impressive. But the gloss fades with a $32.9 million net loss in 2024. Yes, adjusted EBITDA came in positive at $38.8 million (up from $32.5 million the year prior), suggesting it’s still squeezing more out of operation, but it’s not enough to silence the skeptics. And skeptics there are. Questions around MNTN’s legacy, especially from its earlier SteelHouse chapter – and ongoing concerns about transparency haven’t gone away. In today’s ad tech market – where hype no longer sells itself – that kind of baggage could weigh heavy with institutional investors. For now, though, the market’s buying what MTNN’s selling – and that’s sending a clear signal to private equity firms. PE has long been the default exit for ad tech startups, typically offering seven to 10 times adjusted EBITDA. MNTN, by contrast, hit the public market trading at a staggering 32 times adjusted EBITDA – a multiple that puts it closer to The Trade Desk than a typical mid-market player. “This [the MNTN IPO] could put a spanner in the works when it comes to private equity investors’ plans for ad tech,” said former MNTN executive Dan Larkman, now CEO of CTV advertising partner Keynes Digital. “Even if it settles at 30 times EBITDA, that changes the PE firm’s view of trying to pay seven to 10 times EBITDA to much higher.” A recalibration of this magnitude could shift the entire trajectory for a swath of mid-sized ad tech firms. If public investors are once again willing to reward growth – especially in hotter corners of the market like CTV – the IPO window starts to look less like a last-ditch plan B and more like a viable, even preferable, way out. But only for those with the stomach for it. Going public is no cake walk. It’s a gauntlet of competing stakeholders, relentless scrutiny and virtually no margin for error. That’s why so few ad tech companies, notably The Trade Desk and Criteo, have truly stuck the landing. Still, if MNTN can handle the heat, hold the line and deliver in the quarters to come , it could change the calculus for others. After all, the risks are steep, but so is the upside. Just ask an unnamed ad tech CEO who recently relocated to New York to be closer to the action as they prepare to take their own shot at going public. “He [the CEO] told me as recently as last fall that the aim is to start that process in the near future,” said one ad exec who exchanged anonymity for candor on those plans. Then again, “in the near future” is vague enough to stretch from next quarter to next year. And that’s the tension: the return of the ad tech IPO is far from guaranteed. Solid business fundamentals don’t mean much when the markets they rely on are anything but. A choppy macroeconomic outlook, shaken by trade wars, shifting tariffs and global uncertainty, has consumer spending wobbling. When that happens ad dollars tend to follow. “MNTN isn’t about to challenge the big DSPs like DV360 or The Trade Desk,” said W Media Research’s Weide. “The functionality is much more streamlined by design for smaller advertisers, and might not be feature-rich enough for marketers at bigger advertisers. But where it could create pressure is among smaller demand-side players like StackAdapt or FreeWheel’s Beeswax.” Needless to say, if there’s a moment to make the leap, this might be it. There’s more maturity in the public market’s view of ad tech than there was a decade ago. Back then, hype outpaced clarity. Companies went public on arbitrage plays and fat margins on ad spend, with little transparency into how the sausage was made. The bubble burst, and the scars of rocky IPOs lingered. This time feels different. “Investors have a better handle on the market than they did back then, but I still don’t think they know how to value it properly,” said Keynes Digital’s Larkman. “Ad tech companies don’t own the full ecosystem the way Google or Meta do. They control just a piece of the infrastructure, which makes it harder for investors to understand where the value actually lies – and how to price it accordingly.” The 24-page pitch deck for Amazon’s demand-side platform is telling: it puts its off-Amazon’s ambitions in black and white.

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges." FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Revenue $44.06 billion, +69% y/y, estimate $43.29 billion - Data center revenue $39.1 billion, +73% y/y, estimate $39.22 billion - Automotive revenue $567 million, +72% y/y, estimate $579.4 million - Adjusted gross margin 61% vs. 78.9% y/y, estimate 71% -R&D expenses $3.99 billion, +47% y/y, estimate $4.07 billion - Adjusted operating expenses $3.58 billion, +43% y/y, estimate $3.63 billion - Adjusted operating income $23.28 billion, +29% y/y, estimate $27.15 billion - Adjusted EPS 81c, estimate 93c - Free cash flow $26.14 billion, +75% y/y Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock rose 1% heading into the closing bell on Wednesday. Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: Introduction to Sketching with Code

This article first appeared on kyndinfo.notion.site. For more more information, updates, and additional resources, please see here. I’ve been wanting to write books that are like introductory science texts but not superficial. Books that go beyond pop science explanations but aren’t dry and dense like academic texts. Take quantum physics as an example. A pop science book might explain that the world is made of tiny particles, even smaller than atoms, and that these particles are also waves. Very intriguing. But after reading it, you realize that you still don’t actually understand how to make sense of wave-particle duality, how it really works, or what it means mathematically. So I turn to a college-level book, thinking, “This will give me the answers.” Instead, I find a wall of formalism. Dense derivations, little motivation, and an assumption that I already know what’s important. These books explain the details, but they don’t help me much, not having a real math or science background. Having said this, I’ve been struggling to write a book or article that’s truly for beginners. Many of my past articles were written for relative beginners, often based on lectures, workshops, or explanatory documents I’ve shared with colleagues and friends. I’ve been trying to keep them more engaging rather than feel like dry textbooks. But at the same time, they are not really for beginners. Many of them assume a certain level of prior knowledge, since it is a massive effort to build up all the knowledge from scratch. There are already great resources out there. For example, I don’t think I should write yet another book on vector math, and I’m not the best person to do that. So after contemplating this, I’ve decided to let go of the idea of perfect thoroughness or consistency, at least for now. Chasing that feels like an overwhelming amount of work without yielding much more of what the world might be missing. Instead, what I find could be more fun and uniquely valuable is externalizing the maps in my mind. The overviews, the relationships between key concepts, and the motivations behind them. As always, these are also an exercise for myself. They are like notes to organize and structure ideas, which might one day evolve into a more structured book. At the same time, I’m trying to create something that helps readers orient themselves better. To provide a sense of where things fit, what’s important, and what gaps they might need to fill in from somewhere else. There are 8 sections in this article covering various perspectives. You don’t have to read them in order—use the navigation menu on the left (right for mobile) to jump to any section you like. FAQs Mini License? Can I use the contents? Yes, please! Anything from personal to educational. I’d appreciate if you can let me know where you have used them, but it’s not required. Assume CC BY 4.0 unless otherwise noted. Use at your own responsibility. Read more How can I follow the updates? Follow me on Bluesky, Threads or X/Twitter Is there an index page? Yes, here. We think we naturally know what space is, but do we really? In an everyday sense, space feels like a void for objects and matter to fill. We are all in space and move within space. It seems like a backdrop that exists independently of everything inside it. That’s what Newton thought too. He wrote: Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. But Newton also thought that even if absolute space exists, it is practically inconceivable to us. Where in the absolute are we? We’d never know. So he continues: Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies. What he is saying is that we can only measure position relative to something. When we walk, we know we move relative to the ground, or the Earth. The revolution of the Earth is the movement relative to the Sun. Then the Sun or the solar system moves relative to the galaxy. From a relativistic perspective, both geocentrism and heliocentrism can be seen as correct in their own reference frames, but neither is absolutely correct. It’s just that heliocentrism provides a much simpler model for the motion of planets. However, there is a huge gap between those who only believe in geocentrism and those who discovered heliocentrism, or dogmatists and inquirers. “Orb – on the movement of earth” is a great historical fiction on this topic. We want to draw stuff on a computer. To do that, we need to have three things: an origin (a reference point to measure the position relatively from), axes along which we measure distances, and a unit to define what distance corresponds to a number 1. In theory, you can pick them freely, but most software has its own default coordinate system. For 2D drawing, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, P5.js, and openFrameworks, the origin is usually the top-left corner of a canvas, and axes are horizontal (x) and vertical (y). The unit is usually a pixel or the device unit. For example, on a Retina display Mac, 1 point corresponds to 2 or 3 (or other numbers depending on your settings) physical pixels. This factor is set so that the numbers you choose appear about the same size perceptually regardless of the actual resolution of the device. A bit more about “perceptually the same size” : for example, text of size “14” is usually rendered smaller on mobile devices than on a laptop, and much bigger on a TV, because these devices are designed to be seen from different viewing distances. There is no perfect formula for this, but most manufacturers converge in the same range, so you don’t have to worry too much about each device separately. I said “default” because in many cases, you can manipulate the space, or rather the coordinate system. In design tools, you can drag the canvas and zoom in and out. Programming frameworks often provide methods to translate, scale and rotate the space, such as p5.js’s translate(), scale(), rotate() functions, or you can write your own functions to process the coordinates. You can also skew the space. Axes are usually selected to cross at 90° but this isn’t necessary. As long as they are independent, meaning they are not parallel, you can express a position uniquely by selecting one value for each of the axes. The demo below from the Mapping page demonstrates affine transformation, which is a simple method to enable these kinds of coordinate transformations. Once you have a coordinate system, you can move things around in this space. Newtonian physics is the perfect stating point. In Newtonian physics, you start from a position, then apply velocity to move it, and apply acceleration to change the velocity. All of these are expressed by vectors, which is basically just a few numbers (called components) put together. Expressing them as vectors makes it much easier to handle them, as opposed to manipulating the values per axis, and there are several very useful operations defined for vectors that you cannot avoid because they’re too good. Newton and VectorsVector Operations Of course, what comes after 2D is 3D. Moving up one dimension is just simple. You define a position is a vector with 3 components instead of 2. Do the same for the velocity, acceleration, etc. as long as they are defined as vectors, the math stays basically the same. What is different, and can be a lot more challenging, is rendering. Because your canvas is 2D, you cannot just place things defined in a 3D space on it. You need to translate the points in 3D space to 2D space somehow. This is called projection, which dates back to the 15th century during Brunelleschi’s time. Projection and 3D Rendering A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Also, to make things look 3D, lighting or shading (basically the same thing — you add light to the scene, which creates shade too) plays an important role. Without light and shade, a sphere would look like just a circle. Shadows casting from one object onto another will clarify their spatial relationship. Light It is your choice of style though. You can choose to draw your scene flat and cartoonish. You can go up to higher dimensions. No matter how much you go up, vectors will help you keeping the math the same. Thinking about higher dimensions not usually for graphics, but any data that can be represented with multiple numeric parameters are thought as a vector in multi dimensional space, with each parameter corresponding to a single axes. Then you can apply familiar concepts and operations to the data, such as addition, multiplication, calculating distance and angle, etc. In fact, large language models (LLM) represent concepts like “dog,” “human,” “run,” “happy,” etc. as points in a mega-multidimensional space (like, 3072 dimensions), and you can do math between them to, for example, measure conceptual distance or similarity between two words or sentences. Getting familiar with this is critical for understanding how current AI models work. Dimensions Colors can be represented with a series of numbers, such as R, G, and B. So they are vectors, and they live in a space. In fact, people have invented many different spatial models to represent colors “accurately” for different purposes. Imagining the relationship of colors spatially helps grasping them holistically and intuitively. Changing the hue is rotation, brightening is ascending, etc. Each different color model organizes colors differently, offering different mental models. Choosing the right model for your purpose can be critical for making your work easy and look good. Colors and Numbers In a space, you can measure distances between points. The most common way is the Euclidean distance, which is basically the length of the straight line between two points. In math, there are various kinds of spaces and some of them don’t have the concept of distance. But that is not the only distance we care about. How do you measure the distance from Tokyo to São Paulo? What you want is probably not a straight line distance between two points, but a curved length along the surface of the Earth. This is called spherical geometry. How about a checkerboard? How do you measure distances between two squares? Perhaps the number of moves it takes? Various distances The concept of distance becomes important in various cases, for example in finding the shortest path to move characters along in game design, or dividing territories based on the distances. Visualizing Distances In computer graphics, functions that returns the distance from a point to the surface of object, called signed distance functions, or SDF are often used for 3D rendering. Signed distance functions So, what is space, after all? The answer depends. For most of our purposes when sketching something with code, Newtonian or Euclidean spaces provide the most intuitive and familiar way of thinking about space — flat, predictable, and measurable with straightforward distances and angles. But this is neither the only space nor the true shape of space. It’s not the true shape of space because Einstein’s general relativity describes spacetime as a curved, four-dimensional manifold. Meanwhile, quantum physics reveals that at the smallest scales, space and time behave in probabilistic, discontinuous, and often counterintuitive ways. Scientists have shown that our naive, everyday understanding of space and time breaks down at both the micro and macro scales. It’s not the only space because mathematicians have been generalizing and expanding the concept of “space.” Riemannian geometry broadens the idea of geometry to include uniform and non-uniform curved spaces, including Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, and other geometries we touched upon in the distance discussion above. Space isn’t even just about distance or geometry. Topology focuses on how shapes are connected, regardless of size or distance. Mathematics even defines spaces that aren’t intuitively spatial at all, like the space of all polynomials of a certain degree, where the focus is on the coefficients rather than the shape or a curve. If you’re interested, go forward and explore these fascinating concepts. Color is a fascinating topic that lies between science and human perception. Physically, we know how humans perceive colors. We have photoreceptors called cones in our eyes that react to different frequencies of light, and the levels of stimuli to these three types of cones determine what color we see. The coverage of each type of cone roughly matches with the spectrum of red, green, and blue; that’s why RGB displays can show us various colors even though they have only three colors of light-emitting elements. Spectrum and Cones However, this model doesn’t necessary explain what we actually experience. For example, the violet and red at both ends of the spectrum are actually continuous, with purple in between them. We see different brightness depending on the hue even when the amount of physical light is the same (in general, yellow looks much brighter than blue). We even associate different feelings, emotions, and meanings to the colors. People have been creating different models to describe colors. These are roughly divided into two categories: ones that are mainly derived from physical properties, and ones are more based on the ways we normally describe colors. The first challenge in systematizing colors is that different people have different responses to the spectrum of colors. To find a sort of average, called the standard (colorimetric) observer, an experiment called Wright-Guild color matching was conducted. The basic idea is that the participant is presented with a monochromatic color, which is a color with a single frequency of light, and asked to reproduce the same color by mixing three primary colors (red, green, blue) to match with a target color. The tricky part is that the three physical lights can’t reproduce every color. The participants could match a lot of the target colors just by adjusting the brightness of each primary. But for some colors, they couldn’t get it right unless they actually subtracted one of the primary lights. There isn’t such a thing called negative light, so they solved this by adding the “negative” light to the target color side instead of the mixing side. To better understand this, look at the chart above again. Because each cone covers a relatively broad range, there is no light that can stimulate them independently. There are inevitably certain balances of cone stimulations that can’t be achieved using just a combination of three lights. They eventually transformed the data into something called the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which is basically a remapping of the RGB measurements to get rid of the negative values by picking new “primaries” that were more imaginary concepts than actual lights. CIE Color spaces Most color models today are based on this CIE color space, meaning that the values in a system can be converted to values in XYZ. The RGB color model that we use on computers today completely fits within the XYZ color space (because by definition, XYZ space has all the human-perceivable colors and even more). Some other ways of describing colors are based on the ways we talk about colors. When we see colors, we say which kind of colors they are (reddish, yellowish), how bright or dark they are, how saturated or vivid, or dull or grayish, etc. The Munsell color system is a system to break down colors by three attributes: hue (such as red, blue, and green), value (lightness), and chroma (vividness or purity of the color). The many color models we use on computers are similar to Munsell’s model, but are designed to be able to be mapped to the RGB values on the screen and thus to XYZ values. Various Color Models These models allow us to compute colors. For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, or rotate colors. What operations make sense and the results you get vary from model to model, and it is important to select a model for your purpose. Computing Colors Being able to process colors to get the desired tone is a critical skill in image and video production. Color Processing Mixing colors is its own deep world. There are so many ways to mix colors. If you are familiar with tools like Photoshop, you probably know there are a bunch of “blending modes” such as add, multiply, screen, overlay, etc. These are different ways to calculate a new color based on the input colors. Most of them are defined with RGB color model. Using the other models can yield different results. Mixing colors in the real world is even more complex, because the color mixing in the real world is the result of various materials reflecting, refracting, and absorbing light. There isn’t a single formula to solve this, but the Kubelka-Munk model is known for emulating real paints consisting of a medium and different colored particles inside. Mixing Colors Light striking the retina lets us see colors. To fully understand how colors happen to us, we must understand how light travels from its source to our eyes, bouncing off surfaces while reflecting and refracting along the way. Reflection and Refraction When the light hits an object, the object absorbs some of the light and reflects the others. On transparent objects, some also passes through. Different materials behave differently. If the material absorbs red and yellow spectrums of light more than blue, then the object will look blue. Rough surfaces will scatter the light in all different directions, thus you don’t see clear reflections of other objects on them, while smooth surfaces will mirror the surroundings more clearly. There are many different methods to simulate this process, from very rough to more accurate approaches. Studying these methods can help you understand how we see colors on objects and better control the colors and appearance of your rendering. Illuminating objects The last section is just an example of using these theories in practice. This installation for KAF Digital space mixes several methods discussed above to fill the space with colors that have the more meditative quality of Fangor’s oil painting, appearing less digital and flashy. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Filling Space with Colors One of the most fun parts of sketching with code is that it’s not static. Let’s draw both in space and time. How do you move a thing? Just push it. Sir Isaac Newton basically said that things stay at rest in the same position, or keep moving at the same velocity until you apply force to accelerate them. Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are the most fundamental concepts to understand physical motion. Emulating these concepts is extremely simple: frame by frame, just add force to acceleration to change it, then acceleration to velocity, then velocity to position. Newtonian mechanics Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are in relationships of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is the rate of change, and integration is the accumulation of changes. For example, velocity is a quantity that describes how much position will change at a certain moment, and position is the result of velocity being applied and accumulated over time. These subjects might have been annoying in math class. But the foundational ideas are quite simple, and luckily in sketching motion with code, you usually don’t have to solve any equations, but instead can use a very rough approximation called numerical integration, which breaks down the changes into simple additions per small amount of time. You probably have been using this method already without knowing it, for example, the Newtonian physics simulations above are based on a numerical approach instead of mathematically accurate methods. DifferentiationIntegration The proper way to solve differentiation and integrations by solving equation is called analytical solution. Then the approximation by dividing the changes over a small amount of time is called numerical approximation. As mentioned above, the latter is the most common and actually more useful in so many cases, but understanding the relationship between these two approaches is important since both have their own merits and drawbacks. The numeric approach is preferred not just because it’s easier, but because it’s also more flexible. Solving motion through equations is like predicting the future. Once solved, you know exactly what will happen at any moment. But it’s often difficult or impossible to account for all variables. Even calculating the movement of three objects drawn by gravity becomes unpredictable. Any system involving external factors, like human interaction, cannot be determined in advance. Since the numeric approach calculates changes bit by bit (very often frame by frame), it is pretty easy to react to unpredictable changes by updating parameters in real time. The prediction of the gravitational motion of three objects, made popular by Cixin Liu’s bestseller The Three-Body Problem, is called the Three-Body Problem. While solving the two-body problem (like the Earth and Moon) is relatively straightforward and has a neat, predictable solution, the three-body problem is usually chaotic and unpredictable. A common drawback with numerical methods is their inaccuracy. Because these methods approximate smooth motion through discrete changes, the results can go slightly off from physically accurate motion. There are several ways to minimize this problem. The most popular approaches are called the Improved Euler method and Runge-Kutta method (the Euler method is actually a special case of Runge-Kutta). Continuous Time and Discrete Time Simulations are, by nature, hard to predict precisely, because that’s the point. They’re meant to create or mimic phenomena that can’t be fully described in advance. We simulate weather, for example, because we don’t know exactly what will happen. But this can be a problem when you want more direct control over how things move, where they end up, and when. Also sometimes, you may even want to break the laws of physics. Great animators and motion designers often exaggerate movement and timing, bending or ignoring realism to create something more expressive or impactful. A very common technique in motion design is called tweening, short for in-betweening. You start from defining a start and end state, then fill the intermediate frames by interpolating between them. The word comes from the days when animators hand-drew the frames that filled the gap between key poses (many still do — some expressions simply can’t be captured any other way). In computer animation, we often use easing functions to control these transitions. Easing functions connect one value to another, changing the pace in between, like slowing in, speeding out, bouncing, etc. In motion design, you can think of an easing function as a kind of mapping between time and another value, such as position, scale, or opacity. Interpolation and Animation Things don’t just move freely in the real world. On Earth, everything is bound by gravity. Our body movement is constrained by the structure of bones and muscles, but this constraint is what lets us move around and lift things using our bones as levers. Adding constraints to objects is a way to add reality to the motion. Verlet Integration is a way to create simple physics simulations by connecting dots with sticks which constrains the distance between two points. Though simple, this technique is very flexible, and by combining multiple points and sticks, you can create various kinds of objects from rigid bodies to soft string-like objects. Building Ragdolls To control movement more precisely and intentionally, you might want to study kinematics. Forward kinematics and inverse kinematics are common techniques used in robotics, games, and so on to describe the motion of jointed parts, such as mechanical arms or human bodies. Both methods handle structures made of multiple segments and joints to connect them. Forward kinematics starts from the root of the connection and propagates the posture going forward to the end. You directly manipulate the rotation of each joint, and that will determine the overall movement. Kinematics Inverse kinematics is more goal-driven. You define where you want the endpoint to be, then the algorithm figures out the rotation of each joint that makes the desired result happen. Kinematics Motion of objects and life in the real world is often unpredictable, and you can always introduce some randomness to your design. The demo below shows four random walkers with different methods to generate random values. In real applications, you might want to combine more predictable methods like above with some randomness. Depending on your goal, play around and find a sweet spot. Taming Randomness While we’ve explored how to move objects and characters, there’s one more crucial but invisible actor to consider: the camera. How you frame the scene and position the viewpoint dramatically shapes the final result. Camera in Action When you sketch with motion, you’re not just placing things in space but you are giving them life in time. Whether you follow the rules of physics, break them for expressiveness, or invent your own systems, motion opens a lot possibilities for exploration and creativity. If you’re curious, keep experimenting and see where the next movement leads. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Human perception has evolved over a long time to give us useful information about the world. But what we perceive is only a little sliver of what’s actually out there. For example, light, or electromagnetic waves more broadly, spans a vast range of frequencies, but we can only see a small part of that spectrum. The reason we probably settled on this specific range is that it was good enough to detect and distinguish everyday objects, plants, and animals, helping us survive and navigate our environment. Another reason is more physical: many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, like X-rays or gamma rays, tend to pass through objects or scatter unpredictably. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, for animals to evolve organs that can capture them. The way we perceive different physical phenomena doesn’t always match their actual physical nature. Light and sound are both waves, but we almost never experience them as vibrations (except for very low-frequency sounds). In both cases, frequency affects what we perceive, but in very different ways. Sound frequencies are perceived as pitch, and we describe them as “high” or “low.” On the other hand, different frequencies of light appear to us as different hues of colors without any sense of high or low frequency. Studying perception is fascinating because every person’s experience of the world is different. No one else sees exactly the same colors you see. Your perception exists only within you and doesn’t exist without you. For this reason, the study of perception can’t be purely objective. We have to ask people how they feel. In fact, the color models we use today are based on data collected from many people comparing colors and describing how similar or different they appear. Some people may extend this to say the world doesn’t exist without you, or it is impossible to understand someone else. Let’s not go there yet. How we perceive and use color is shaped by many different factors. First, our biology. As we touched upon earlier, we perceive different light frequencies as different hues, not as a one-dimensional gradient from red to violet, but arranged in a circle. This is because we perceive colors based on the balance between three receptors (cones) for different ranges of frequencies, each roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue. The actual light is a mixture of different frequencies. If a light contains more blue and red but less green, we perceive it as purple, a color that doesn’t actually exist in the spectrum itself — below red is infrared, and above violet is ultraviolet. This reminds us that color might be more about what’s happening inside us than something intrinsic to the light itself. Colors are also cultural and social. Despite not knowing exactly what other people are seeing, we tend to generally agree on how we see colors. We can think of this in terms of semantics, such as red or yellow-and-black stripes for danger, to feelings and aesthetics like “blue feels cool” and “green is relaxing,” to what feels pleasing versus jarring. These associations likely started from nature, where certain objects and phenomena have specific frequencies, and then were influenced by cultural aspects, as certain colors are used repeatedly in specific ways to reinforce our associations. For example, unripe fruits are usually green, and they turn yellow, orange, or red when they are ready to eat, and we’ve been reinforcing these associations by using these warm colors on food packages, signboards, etc. Our view on colors has also been significantly influenced and constrained by our tools. People have been working hard to reproduce and create various colors—from using plant-based dyes, to making expensive gemstones into paints, chemical and synthetic compounds, to analog and digital displays, and even nanotechnologies to create structural colors (such as iridescence). As colors became more available, they got more involved in our culture and even economies, creating trend cycles of colors to drive consumption. The fact that people don’t see colors in the same way cannot be emphasized enough. It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency. I’d even hesitate to call it a ‘deficiency’—it’s really just a different way of seeing. We often use charts like the one below to simulate different perceptions (the demo is emulating deuteranopia). This probably does a good job of illustrating where people may have difficulty distinguishing colors, but this is not representing the world they’re seeing. It’s not true to say the world appears mostly yellow and blue to people with deuteranopia. Representing someone’s vision for someone else is impossible, but at least understanding how we see colors and how to manipulate them systematically can help us imagine and approach this challenging and fascinating problem. Computing Colors All of this shows that color perception is a complex mix of physical phenomena, evolutionary quirks, instinct, culture, and tools from pigments to pixels. And all of it is, in a way, somewhat arbitrary. It’s just the way the world and we humans happened to turn out. Depending on the angle you look from, you can describe color in many different ways. That’s why we have so many color systems and models. We are only scratching the surface of this topic in Colors and Numbers, but there are tons more that we can discuss. I recommend the following book for the history of color theories and their use. The History of Colour: A Universe of Chromatic Phenomena This comprehensive, beautiful book delves deep into the complex but fascinating story of our relationship with colour throughout human history. Amazon Sound is also a wave. Unlike color, we can actually feel its frequency more directly, though we don’t always notice it as physical vibration. Lower frequencies feel “low,” and higher frequencies feel “high.” This height of sound is called pitch. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Western music typically divides the octave is into 12 pitches, each spaced evenly in terms of frequency ratio. Other musical cultures divide the octave differently. Some use more notes, some fewer, but the concept of the octave itself shows up pretty much everywhere. Pitch and Frequency Not just pitch, we can also tell sounds apart based on their timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. In Japanese, timbre is called 音色 (on-shoku), which literally means “sound color.” Both pitch and timbre are tied to the physical characteristics of the thing that’s making the sound. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. The pitch depends on its length and weight. The longer or heavier the string, the lower the pitch. But the sound a string makes isn’t just one pure frequency. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. This happens with any object, though the mix of frequencies might be a lot messier. Just like colors are usually a blend of frequencies, sounds are too. But unlike color, where a certain frequency always looks like the same hue (e.g., 440 THz light always looks red), sound doesn’t work that way. A guitar sounds like a guitar no matter what note it plays, because its timbre comes from the relationship between the overtones, not the absolute frequencies themselves. That’s why we can tell a violin from a flute, or recognize someone’s voice, or know what kind of object made a noise, based on how that sound’s overtones are structured regardless of the frequency. You can sing a high note or low note, and you will still sound like you. It is interesting to think about this from an evolutionary standpoint. Our hearing has evolved to react to frequency ratios probably because that was useful in identifying different sources, people, animals, objects, etc. This sensitivity also lets us enjoy the different tones of sound and the relationships between different pitches of sound, which is known as harmony in music. Understanding wave properties helps us better comprehend the relationship between physical vibrations and the sounds that we hear, and sketch ideas playing around with and visualizing sound. Sound visualizationSine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Something that I think is understated, but has been a very useful insight for sketching and designing things, is that the relationship between physical quantities and their impact on human perception is logarithmic in many cases. For example, the strength of the light we feel is depends on the number of photons our eyes catch. But twice the photons doesn’t mean it feels twice as bright. Physically, a sunny day outdoors can have 200 times more light than a well-lit office. But does it feel 200 times brighter? Probably not. The same goes for sound. Loudness is related to the energy of the sound, which is directly related to the amplitude of the sound wave. But again, the relationship to the way we feel is not direct. A subway might have 100 times more sound energy than someone talking, but it doesn’t feel 100 times louder. This can be seen in a couple of ways. Life had to survive across wildly different conditions, like daylight and moonlight. So our perception systems likely evolved to compress all that information into a manageable scale. The other way to look at it is that when numbers are huge, small changes matter less. Imagine you’re stuck in traffic — a 10-minute delay feels huge when your trip is only 15 minutes, but it doesn’t matter as much if you’re going for a 5-hour drive. Similarly, adding a candle doesn’t help much when you’re already under the sun, while it can make a huge difference when you’re in a cave. Physical values and human perception Humans could have evolved more sensitive eyes like cats to see in darkness, but we haven’t. Perhaps our ancestors were not as nocturnal as cats, or they weren’t nocturnal because they didn’t have cats’ eyes. Either way, we managed to survive.There is an important nuance here. Life doesn’t evolve with purpose. A statement like “giraffes acquired long necks in order to eat leaves high up” is misleading. The reality is more like something random happened to the genes, and that change happened to give the genes themselves a better chance to be passed on to following generations. This taps into another important topic. Resolution is how detailed something can be represented or perceived. There is a certain limit to our senses regarding how small a difference we can detect, or how finely we can distinguish things from one another, and various technologies actively exploit these limitations to deliver experiences. For example, computer displays are made of small dots. But when these dots are small enough — somewhere around 300 DPI（dot per inch) at reading distance, or a viewing angle of 1 arcminute (1/60 degree) — our eyes and brain stop seeing the dots and start to see images and characters. Movies have only 24 frames per second, but that’s enough to make us believe they are smooth and real. The majority of digital audio uses 44,100 samples per second, which means a second of sound is represented by 44,100 numbers. This rate was selected because it is enough to reproduce sound up to 20,000 Hz, which is about the upper limit of pitch that humans can hear. If humans had different capabilities, these technologies could have been designed differently. An interesting part is even when there isn’t enough resolution, our brain often try to see continuity by complementing the missing details. Early monitors were much more coarse and the pixels were far more visible. But people were accepting the quality, and there is even appreciation and nostalgia for the low resolution graphics aka 8-bit style. Animations, especially cartoonish ones, can utilize a lower frame rate to add unique effects. Sometimes, letting the brain fill in the gaps is better than trying to draw everything in detail and having the illusion fall apart by having discrepancies here and there. When we sketch with code, we are always engaging with how humans perceive things. Our senses are full of quirks. They compress, filter, and interpret the raw physical world in different ways to make sense of it. Understanding how human perception works helps us see things and make things from different perspectives. It feels fascinating and freeing that when it comes to human perception, there’s no one right model, just many ways to look at things. Embrace the differences and complexity, and have fun. Humans are wired to spot patterns. Our ancestors survived by recognizing various footprints to avoid danger and find food, spots and dots on fur, rotational patterns of petals, cycles of the sun, moon, stars and repeating seasons, tides, and weather. Repeating patterns are fundamental to design and art. We see them everywhere, like in the repeating columns of ancient buildings, brick patterns, glass tiles on skyscrapers, and street pavements. Checkers, stripes, and other repeating motifs appear universally in decoration and textiles. Musicians create structure through rhythms, phrases, and chord cycles. Patterns are powerful vocabulary. Following patterns makes things predictable. It is often relaxing and comforting, but intense rhythm can also bring energy and even trance. Breaking a predictable rhythm creates tension, drawing people’s attention, and going back and forth between tension and familiar patterns is a way to drive a song or a story. At the basis of patterns is repetition. We recognize patterns because the same thing happens again and again. There are many methods to create and handle repetitions mathematically and programmatically. For example, modulo is basically a mathematical way of saying “count to n then go back to one and repeat,” which is just dividing a number by another number and taking the remainder. This is common in everyday life, like the time on a clock or the days of a week, and is a basis for many repeating patterns, such as repeating tiles and musical rhythms below. This can be easily expanded to repetition of continuous values. Repetition The sine wave is another fundamental building block for repeating patterns. A mind-blowing fact is that with an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. They are so universal and useful that you’ll bump into them in many places, such as audio and signal processing, and a whole lot of physics. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Tiling is one of the most obvious visual patterns. By repeating the same elements in a space, or dividing a space based on some rules, we can create various interesting patterns that can continue forever. The patterns can be simple repetition of the same geometric shapes to something more unique and interesting like M. C. Escher’s drawings. There are patterns that are not exactly regular and predictable like Penrose tiles or Truchet tiles. A Voronoi diagram is a method to create more organic patterns. Cells in Voronoi diagrams are all different, but humans can still see that they follow the same rules or a “pattern.” Just like when you look through a microscope, no cells in nature are exactly the same, but we can intuitively see they are the same thing regardless. Instead of dividing space, we can create musical rhythm by dividing time. Even within the same tempo and time signature, time can be divided differently, and the way you divide dictates the “feel” of the rhythm. Experienced musicians have a finely tuned resolution of time, meaning they can feel this division more granularly and accurately and precisely position their notes. Many players also adjust the timing slightly off from the exact timing naturally or intentionally to create add more nuances, such as heavy or bouncy rhythms. Resolution – Rhythm Click on “Run Pen”, then click one more time to play the sound. Music has many layers of repetition beyond basic drum loops. From guitar riffs that stick in your head to rhythmic and melodic patterns of phrases, song structure is built by repeating different sections, such as verses, bridges, and choruses. There is so much more that I can write here that we can talk about. Again, nothing follows a perfectly regular pattern. Randomness is a great tool that can help make our sketches more interesting and natural. Randomness is, by definition, hard to predict, but that doesn’t mean it’s uncontrollable. There are many different ways to “shape” randomness for your purpose. Let’s take a die as an example. A single throw of a fair die is completely unpredictable. The probability for all possible results is equal. But if you throw it twice and sum the results, you will get more 7s than 12s. The more times you throw a die, the more the sum or average will converge to a certain expected value. This is called the Law of Large Numbers. You can also apply some function to random results to adjust the distribution. For example, if you take a square of a random floating number from 0.0 to 1.0, you get this shape. Can you see the difference between these two cityscapes? These are made by using the exact same regular grid with two different functions that give them subtly different impressions. In most cities, building heights in the suburbs show little variation because nearly everything is only a few stories tall. Downtown, though, the range is much wider. While many buildings are still modest in height, a handful of skyscrapers rise far above the rest. You can think of this as a “pattern” that can repeat across many cities. Taming Randomness Noise functions are methods to get randomly but continuously changing, like the up and down of terrain, the change of temperature, or the direction an animal wanders. These are all unpredictable, but unlike dice rolls, they look smoothly connected and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. There are many noise function algorithms, but most major ones share a simple idea of smoothly connecting random numbers. So the values are random, but if you pick a point close to another, they return relatively close values, and there is no abrupt jump, or discontinuity between them. Noise functions are often layered by adding them together at different scales to create a more natural look. Imagine a mountain range. From far away, you see its jagged silhouette. As you hike closer, you start to see smaller ridges, and up close, you notice every rock face has tiny cracks and ledges that are similar to larger forms. It is quite a common pattern in nature for things to repeat similar shapes at many levels of zoom. You can find this in rolling clouds, breaking waves, cracked desert ground, leaf veins, and the shape of coastlines. Taming RandomnessReading a Noise FunctionDrawing Landscape This common pattern is called fractal. A fractal is a pattern or shape that repeats the same structure at different scales, in such a way that a part of the shape resembles the whole, and a sub-part of a part resembles the larger part. Layering of noise functions can be seen as a way to emulate the fractal nature of the real world with a finite number of computations (for example, the landscape demo above is made of 9 iterations of the same noise). Some mathematically defined fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set, have literally infinite details. The real world is messy with infinite detail. When we see or hear things for the first time as a baby, we can’t make sense of them because they are like a raw stream of data with no structure. But as we keep experiencing similar things appear and occur, our brain starts to grasp patterns. We no longer track every speck of bark on a tree, but we just think “tree.” This is a shortcut to let us deal with overwhelming complexity and act quickly. It works the other way around, too. When information is missing, like in a blurry photo or garbled phone call, our brain tries filling the gaps with its library of familiar patterns. Resolution Does this sounds like data compression? Yes, many technologies like ZIP, JPEG, or MP3 borrow the basically same trick. They hunt for repeated structure in data, toss the redundant bits, and keep a smaller blueprint. Decompressors rebuild the original (or close enough) by reading that blueprint plus a few rules, just like our brain filling in a pixelated image. I wanted to study and write an article about information theory and data compression. I might, someday. And AI image generation. The foundational idea of diffusion models is to show the AI the process of adding noise to an image until it becomes unrecognizable, and have it learn the backward process to re-imagine plausible details of images from noise. “Pattern” is a broad word. We started from simple repetitions and reached our recognition of the noisy world. At a meta level, patterns what let us make sense of the world. They are so crucial for us to grasp and organize information. But at the same time, it is also important to remember that leaning to match on patterns can make us overlook the details that matter, sliding into stereotypes and snap judgments. We need to free ourselves from familiar patterns sometimes. A fun and useful practice is to jump between levels. Spotting big patterns while appreciating the subtle differences, nuances, and noise without falling into excessive generalizations. Master that dance and you’re using your built‑in compressor to its fullest, while staying aware of both its strengths and its traps. Yes I’m taking about both life and art. Interpolation is about estimating the values that lie between the points you already know. When you’re moving a character from point A to B, you interpolate between them so you know where the character is at a given time. You know the stock price in May and July, so you interpolate between them to estimate what the price was in June. The idea is so simple, and applicable to so many things. Let’s start from the simplest case where the value changes at the same rate all the way. Suppose that point P moves from one point A to another point B, and the variable t is the ratio how much P has moved between them. If t = 0, P is in the same position as A. If t = 1, P is in the same position as B, and if t = 0.5, P is exactly at the midpoint between A and B. This can be expressed as follows. A, B, and P can be either numbers or vectors. Interpolation and Animation – Linear Interpolation If we interpolate between points in 2D, we can draw a line segment. But things don’t always change at the same pace. To manipulate the rate, we use different functions called easing functions. Easing functions are not a clearly defined category, and they can be any function that can map a range of values (usually 0 to 1) to the same range continuously, keeping the start and end the same. MappingEasing functions On a one dimensional line, you can draw only a single path between two points, but in higher dimensions, like 2D or 3D, there are infinite ways to connect two dots. Defining a path between points in flexible but precise way is very crucial for computer graphics to draw lines and shapes. One of the most common methods called Bézier curve is basically to repeat linear interpolations multiple times. The demo below illustrates this idea. Bézier and Spline There are many different methods to draw curved lines similar to Bézier curves but with more advanced features. For example, B-spline introduces additional parameters to adjust the weights of each point to add more nuanced control over the line’s shape. Bézier and Spline – B-Spline When we draw curves, we often care how smooth they are. What smooth means can vary, but to deal with a specific kind of smoothness, there is a very useful mathematical concept called continuity. To measure how smooth a curve is in a mathematical sense, you can take the derivative of the function that represents the curve. The first derivative shows the rate of change of position, and the second derivative shows the rate of change of the rate of change. An algorithm called natural spline is designed to guarantee C2 Continuity at anywhere through a curved line goes through multiple points. While a natural spline is mathematically smooth, it may not always look like the smoothest line to human eyes. The Hobby curve algorithm minimizes curvature at each point along the line, making strokes that look like Henri Matisse’s stroke drawn with a very long brush. Controlling curves For connecting lines or interpolations smoothly, Hermite interpolation, or so-called smoothstep functions are often used. When t moves from 0 to 1, these functions can adjust the rate of change to make the derivative at the beginning and the end be zero. The first formula guarantees C1 continuity and the second one is for C2, the last one is the general form for any level of continuity. The formulas themselves are not very intuitive, but if you look at the graphs below, you can visually confirm that the rate of change becomes zero. The graph to the left shows the first derivative, and the one to the right shows the second derivative. For example, these demos for the noise functions from the Taming Randomness page use the Hermite functions. Instead of trying to control the interpolation precisely, there are methods to use algorithms to figure out the exact way to interpolate between points. This is particularly useful when there are multiple data points spread across a space. RBF interpolation is one of those methods. It solves for weights automatically and produces a smooth surface that passes through however many points you throw at it, even in higher dimensions. Take a look at the demo of RBF interpolation in 2D space. You can drag white points to play around. Continuous Mapping Interpolation is not just about moving things and drawing lines. Colors are another good example. You can mix two or more colors by interpolating between them. Your result can be different depending on which color model you use. You could even draw a curved line in a color space to get an interesting gradient. You might have seen a menu to select (re)sampling method when you are resizing an image in graphics software like Adobe Photoshop. These software programs take colors from the closest pixels and interpolate between them. In case of Photoshop, “Nearest Neighbor” means no interpolation (just pick a color from a single closest pixel), “Bilinear” linearly blends the 2 × 2 neighborhood, “Bicubic” uses a cubic function to give it C1 continuity. Mixing Colors As you might have noticed already at this point, you can interpolate between anything that can be represented as vectors. By seeing things through the lens of concepts like vectors and interpolation, we can treat many things in the same way (that is the power of abstraction). Interpolation is indeed a powerful and versatile technique to add to your toolbox. There is a very similar and related concept called extrapolation. As the name suggests, extrapolation is to extend a line beyond the ends. Extrapolation are used to predict values beyond the boundary of known data points (predict the future!). It’d be interesting to explore this topic too if you are interested. Waves are everywhere. I suppose the word originally meant just waves on the water surface, like the ocean or a lake. However, there are many other things that exhibit characteristics of waves, such as sound, earthquakes, electromagnetic waves, and light. In terms of design and graphics, wavy shapes are one of the most common patterns and are often seen in fashion, architecture, and various art and craft pieces. Wave Mathematically, the sine wave is the most fundamental wave shape. It represents the position of a point on a unit circle as the center angle changes. A sine curve can be drawn as a result of a physical object following the spring equation (Hooke’s law, F=-kx). Basically, this means if you vibrate a thing attached to a spring and plot its position over time, you get a sine curve. It is fascinating that these seemingly very different methods result in the exact same curve, which indicates that there’s something special about the sine curve (yes, it is). Waves propagate and spread in space. Many waves are mechanical, meaning they are caused by physical materials pushing against each other. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and pushes the air around, which pushes the air next to it, and so forth. Sound is propagated across a room as oscillations of air pressure this way. Earthquakes, ocean waves, etc., all belong to this category. Direction of the wavesVibration and Propagation Electromagnetic waves are a different class of wave that needs no material medium at all. Electromagnetic waves have properties of both particles (photons) and waves. Light, radio, microwaves, X‑rays, etc. are the same phenomenon at different frequencies. What oscillates is simply the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields themselves. What is light? Even without a medium, electromagnetic waves still obey the same wave physics, such as reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction. The concept of “wave” is an abstraction to capture these common characteristics between different things and phenomena. It’s not that they behave the same because they are waves, but we call them waves because they follow the same rules. For example, electromagnetic waves are diffractive, meaning that they can go around behind obstacles just like waves on the surface of water. Thanks to diffraction (along with reflection and scattering) we can watch TV or use cellular phones even when there is an obstacle between the antenna and the devices. What is light? Electromagnetic waves between about 400–800 terahertz are what we normally think of as light, and they are visible to human eyes. Depending on the frequency of light, we see different colors. Understanding how different frequencies of light interact with objects before they reach our eyes is crucial for thinking about our vision and how we model these phenomena to create graphics. Spectrum and ConesLight Sound is also a wave. When you clap your hands, pluck a string, or hit a drum, it makes the air vibrate. In the case of light, the frequency corresponds to the color. In sound, the frequency corresponds to the pitch, how high or low it sounds, and the amplitude affects the loudness. “Seeing” the sound wave helps us understand the sound a lot. For example, you can see how different frequencies of sine waves sound, or how various sounds from different instruments look. Sound visualization Musical intervals are based on frequency ratios. The equal temperament commonly used in Western music divides an octave evenly into 12 semitones. No matter where you start on the piano keyboard, the ratio of the frequency from one note to its right neighbor (e.g., C to C#) is 21/12. With the semitone as a unit, we can think of the distance between notes as a simple number relationship. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Upon these notes, we can construct different harmonies. It is all about ratio and relative relationships, and depending on how you lay them out vertically (play at the same time) or horizontally (play in sequence), you can evoke totally different feelings from the same sets of notes, or frequencies. In the slightly more song-like example below, the chord (F major 9th) chord is repeated every second time. Notice how the same chord can sound different depending on the preceding chord. Pitch and FrequencyNumbers and IntervalsThe secrets of sound (for kids) Other than the pitch and loudness, sound also has timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. Timbre comes from the fact that most of the sound don’t consists of a single frequency, but rather a mix of many different frequencies. And the balance between these different frequencies determines the timbre. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. We can visualize this too. In the demo below, you can see the shape of the wave changes as we add extra sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes (the radius of the circle), in this case, getting closer to a so-called square wave. Sine waves and Additive Synthesis I wish I had added sound playback to these demos. I may try later. You can compare the sound of square wave vs. sine wave on this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave_(waveform) This bring us to the favorite topic of synthesizing everything with sine waves. If you have an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any periodic pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. For example, an arbitrary shape, like an alphabet can be written as a Fourier series, or a series of waves. The Fourier transform is widely used in various fields such as sound processing, signal processing, and image compression. By applying Fourier transform to sound data, we can determine the amount of different frequencies contained within it. This lets us manipulate the data by reducing or increasing a certain range of frequencies. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series The Navier-Stokes equations describe the properties and behavior of media such as water and air, including mass conservation, momentum conservation, and viscosity. This is a fundamental theory that explains how waves work in these media, but that’s not all. In computer graphics, these equations are often used for fluid simulation. Understanding and simulating waves using the Navier-Stokes equations can be a fun and interesting research topic. Fluid Simulation Shapes seem like an obvious topic. Since they are ubiquitous, we take them for granted. Many tools provide ways to draw shapes, and many of them are pretty simple, like these functions in p5.js. But as soon as we look more closely, things get complicated. In fact, there are infinite ways to define and draw shapes, and most of the shapes in the wild, from industrial products to nature, have so many nuances. Let’s start with geometric shapes that are (relatively) easier to define mathematically and handle with code. It is easy to draw line segments, circles, etc. in various environments including HTML canvas. However, it is not so easy to draw figures like those in geometry textbooks. Even a simple operation such as drawing a circle around the intersection of two straight lines requires a bit of calculation. The ability to draw a picture and the ability to handle geometry mathematically are two different things. Of course, there are many well-designed libraries out there, but it is also a good learning experience to implement basic functions by yourself. Well it was at least for myself. Geometric Drawings Understanding basic shapes gives us a foundation for drawing many other more complex shapes. You might have experience in drawing shapes with just a compass and ruler in math class. It is sometimes fun to limit your tools and play within the constraints. It is fascinating to see we can create pretty complex shapes just with circles and lines. Geometric Drawings – Other drawings Geometric shapes are widely used in our design. Repeating them in patterns is a major vocabulary of decorative and graphic design. Since ancient times, people have been crafting intriguing patterns by repeating graphic elements or organizing space based on specific rules. Tiling Not just for directly drawing shapes, we often use geometric shapes as proxies for more complex shapes as well. A good example of this is collision detection in games and 3D simulations where we want to detect object intersections. We usually use basic shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, and combinations of them to approximate complex shapes at different precisions as needed. If you’re making a NES game, Mario can be just a rectangle. If you’re making a 3D fighting game, you might want boxes to represent a character’s body, upper and lower arms, fists, etc. separately. A human can tell if two figures overlap or not at a glance. But it is difficult to solve this generally with a computer, and different problems often require different tricks. Various methods of checking whether figures overlap are used to detect collisions between objects in physics simulations and games. You may rely on the functions of existing tools and libraries in actual projects. But knowing the basics will not only help you understand these tools but will also enable you to quickly implement only the functions you need yourself. Detecting Collision The linked page above (Detecting Collision) only covers collision detection in 2D. 3D collision detection can be much more intricate, but understanding in 2D can extend and help a lot in 3D too. Below is a simple reference I found for 3D. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com While straight lines are much easier to handle, curves are the norm on Earth. Nature doesn’t have many straight lines. Almost nothing goes straight, except for light. Curves are obviously a very essential tool for sketching. However, unlike straight lines, which can be defined with just two points and a linear formula, curves have infinite possibilities and are much harder to handle. There have been many different methods of defining or drawing curves, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and constraints. Cumulative Curves One of the most common ways that curves occur in the physical world is through cumulative motion or buildup, meaning a point starts moving from one location and changes its course over time. This can include freehand drawing, paths followed by insects, animals, vehicles, and the growth patterns of plants and other organisms. While the cumulative approach is straightforward and versatile in theory, it is often not the best for many practical use cases where you want more precise control over the overall shape and details, such as in drawing or design tools. These tools usually adopt parametric approaches. In the parametric approach, a shape or curve is defined mathematically using one or more parameters. By varying these parameters, you can generate points that make up the shape. For example, if the parameter is called t, you can get all the points from beginning to end by moving t within a certain range. Parametric Approaches Among parametric approaches, there is a category of methods that are designed to define curved lines freely and precisely with multiple control points. These methods are widely used in design tools such as Adobe Illustrator or Figma, CAD, 3D modeling tools, and others. A spline curve is a mathematically defined curve that smoothly passes through or is close to a series of control points. It is like a big family, and there are many variations including Bézier curves, B-spline curves, NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), Cardinal Splines, Catmull-Rom Splines, Hermite Splines, etc. Bézier and Spline When we talk about shapes, it is important to discuss their quality, not just methods, since after all, we are sketching to express something. Curves can have various visual characteristics. For example, some curves might look more organic and natural, while others might appear more geometric and mechanical. How can we create these different looks of curves? There is another very different category of defining shapes than drawing outlines. “Signed distance functions”, or SDF sounds scary but it is not too crazy to understand. A SDF is a function that can tell you how far a point is from a surface of a shape, say a sphere (usually in Euclidean space) For example the distance of a point of from the surface of a sphere can be expressed as below where p is the coordinate of the point, c is the center of the sphere, and r is the radius: Signed distance functions This is very interesting because SDF is the technique used as basis for many mind-blowing 3D graphics demos with really small amount of code you often find on ShaderToy. Using this method in 3D, you can create different shapes pretty flexibly with a relatively short amount of code using shaders. Projection and 3D Rendering Reading “Raymarching – Primitives” Shaders and 3D rendering have a very steep learning curve. There isn’t a common or obvious way to build knowledge step by step, and it takes learning from multiple resources and examples. Shadertoy is one of the best resources with tons of cool demos with publicly available code. However, understanding this demo code can often be daunting. There are many techniques to grasp, and it’s often difficult to understand what’s happening in the code at first glance. There isn’t really a shortcut here (as far as I know). Studying demo codes step by step, a little by little is the best way. Two following pages are my attempt to help with the journey. Drawing Landscape The landscape example just above shows a lot more intricate and organic shape than other shapes we have been seeing on so far. Many naturally occurring shapes follow a pattern called a fractal, where a shape repeats its structure at different scales. In fractals, parts of the shape resemble the whole, while smaller parts resemble the larger parts. This property, called self-similarity, is key to modeling many complex structures and patterns found in nature, such as coastlines, mountains, clouds, and tree branches. Objects and lives in nature often to form fractal-like structures in the process of building themselves, where similar patterns recur at progressively smaller or larger scales. Understanding this principle can help us sketch them. Fractal Natural shapes are also unpredictable. The ups and downs of terrain, the changes in temperature, or the directions animals wander towards all seem random, but they look smoothly connected too, and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. Noise functions are the go-to methods for this, and we often overlay multiple layers of noise functions in a fractal manner (scale and add) to get desired complexity. Taming Randomness Reading a Noise Function As I said in the beginning, there are infinite ways of defining and drawing shapes. A couple of major topics I didn’t touch upon are: That said, if you’re interested, I recommend building basic tools yourself to learn the fundamentals. Even trying to render a few polygons can provide good insights (hint: project 3D points to 2D screen, calculate normals using cross product of vectors, and apply lighting). All of these sections were originally published as introductory articles, or maps of things in my mind, to provide overviews of different topics in Sketching with Code from different angles. Most of the contents is from Sketching with Math and Quasi Physics (2019), and the other workshop materials or self-educational notes. The majority of them were originally in English, but some were in Japanese first. The translations were done with the help of AI in both directions. I used p5.js for most of the code samples, unless otherwise noted. However, I tried to write them in a way that can be applied to any environment as much as possible. I am not a mathematician or computer engineer. This is simply a compilation of ideas that I have found useful from the perspective of a visually oriented person. If you notice any mistakes, have better examples, or know of links that would aid in learning, please share them with me. In this context, I am less interested in show-off demos, so please refrain from providing tweet-length shaders or similar content. Hope you enjoyed these intros.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it. Google’s hook is that you spend most of your money with Google, you’ll want to use their agents to connect to Google Ads and your data seamlessly.” Webster, formerly a senior executive at WPP’s media investment arm, notes that this AI arms race should cause concern among regulators — Bloomberg likewise reported such DOJ scrutiny last week — with the concerns raised about Google’s AI an echo of those documented in the most recent antitrust case. “From a DOJ point of view, isn’t that a control game… these agents will do things like decide budgets, decide bids, decide planning, and what creative to run,” observed Webster. “If they’re built on Google systems, will Google be able to tweak them to help Google?” “Everything is broken, because it’s designed to be that way… There’s a lot of people out there who are just afraid to ask the right questions, and AI is only going to intensify that.” – A veteran media agency exec discusses how history seems to be repeating itself at the recent Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit, where agency execs grumbled over measurement and attribution. WTF just happened to the IAB Europe’s TCF — and what does it mean for targeted ads in the EU? Perplexity is burning through cash, quickly While the AI-powered search engine has been able to increase its subscription revenue and users in the past 12 months, that growth has come at a large cost. According to The Information, Perplexity generated $34 million in revenue in 2024, but burned through $65 million in cash, which was spent on cloud servers and AI models which power much of its answers. Meta’s attempt to get its antitrust case thrown out failed The FTC’s battle against Meta kicked off on April 14, but Meta has since tried to have the case thrown out. However, on May 20, Judge Boasberg denied Meta’s motion, which asked him to rule against the FTC before it had even launched its defense case, according to The Verge. As TikTok’s U.S. existence is still in limbo, Shop staff are being laid off U.S. TikTok Shop staff were told to work from home on May 21, as they waited to receive emails regarding “difficult decisions,” which everyone understood to mean job cuts, according to Bloomberg. The layoffs follow leadership changes, including those in TikTok Shop which saw Mu, a former exec of Douyin’s (TikTok’s Chinese counterpart) e-commerce arm, take over the platform’s U.S. operations. ‘Marching off a cliff’: Developers at Microsoft Build question their future relevance’ Microsoft Build presenters celebrated the company’s latest advancements in AI, including multi-agent AI orchestration in Copilot Studio, the NLWeb protocol for natural language web interaction, and the integration of xAI’s Grok models into Azure AI Foundry. All these emphasize a shift toward an open agentic web. However, as Semafor’s Rachyl Jones noted, the mood on the floor was not so bullish, noting how one attendee asked: “Is there going to be a Build 2035, or will there not be any more developers?” The disruption of AI flares up adland’s decades-old concerns around disintermediation. At the three-year-old media agency, Mediaplus, the operating philosophy is about personal touch and being a side-by-side partner to clients.

May 26, 2025 21:54 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, May 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held NAPCO shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) NAPCO failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) NAPCO downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) NAPCO’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, NAPCO would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against NAPCO and the underwriter defendants.” “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held NAPCO shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Title: Mitsotakis’ fury (with the Council of State), ND’s proposal regarding Karamanlis, OnlyFans girls beware of the AADE, National Bank’s deals, and Sorras’ coffee machine
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/05/26/mitsotakis-fury-with-the-council-of-state-nds-proposal-regarding-karamanlis-onlyfans-girls-beware-of-the-aade-national-banks-deals-and-sorras-coffee-machine/
Time Published: 2025-05-26T13:38:22Z
Full Content:
Greetings, so the source is one of the best I have at M.M., so I don’t think they would mislead me when they told me the following yesterday: “The Prime Minister is furious about this case, where the Council of State suddenly turned people’s plots into fields (properties on the edges of settlements with less than 2,000 inhabitants), because as he himself says, it is not possible for us to have a huge demographic as well as housing problem – especially in the provinces but also generally throughout Greece – and for the state to…eat up people’s property overnight. Really, where did the judges remember this from, dating back to 1983 when the relevant legislation has been in effect until today?” the source concluded. They also told me that “Mitsotakis is not going to let this go under any circumstances and will exhaust all pressure and options in favor of the ownership of these plots.” The truth is we are talking about an absolute exaggeration and a major injustice. Mitsotakis’ Tours What with the generally good weather, and what with the improvement of the political climate in favor of ND, K.M. has decided to leave Maximos more and more often, touring Attica and beyond. On Saturday he was in Megara, where he spoke to citizens, while his schedule includes a tour in Evia this coming Thursday. According to the program, he will go to Aliveri and to the inauguration of the carbon capture and storage station at the AGET plant. The Proposal and Karamanlis Today or tomorrow, ND is expected to submit its proposal for the preliminary investigation concerning Kostas Karamanlis, on charges of breach of duty as a misdemeanor. I understand that on the same day there will also be some statement from the former minister. The legal document is being finalized, and there will be a reference to Christos Spirtzis, but no prosecution will be made due to the statute of limitations. OnlyFans – Girls and the AADE So, I hear from one of my sources in tax affairs that the OnlyFans business is booming in Greece too, with all social media – mainly TikTok but also Instagram – full of Greek or even foreign girls advertising the world’s oldest profession. And we’re talking about earnings in the range of 15–20 thousand euros per month, not bad at all especially when it’s tax-free. Now, for this to be circulating in the tax authorities, it doesn’t seem like good news for the girls. Audits are coming… The Banks Hit the Markets for Senior Bonds And now onto market news, starting with the banks which are ready this week and next to run senior bond issuances as part of the MREL framework. The time has come, and after all, all banks, systemic and non-systemic, have announced their intentions during the presentation of their quarterly results. The planning for the entire year is for issues totaling around 2.5 billion euros, which concern the replacement of older maturing bonds or refinancing of issues where such an option is foreseen. Banks are accelerating their moves because interest rates have dropped significantly, but mainly because markets are volatile and investors particularly cautious and selective. Moreover, in these issuances the competition is international, as according to the EBA, in 2025 across Europe the following issuances are expected: 262 billion in senior preferred, 107 billion in senior non-preferred, 18 billion in AT1, and 37 billion in Tier 2 bonds. Timing is always critical, so get ready for announcements from Greek banks entering the markets. The Swiss Franc Loan Arrangement is Delayed (but in the works) The Finance Ministry is not ready yet, but promoting a regulation for loans in Swiss francs is a matter of time. A political mandate has been given from M.M., which (rightly) believes that the Government must maintain continuity and that promises must be implemented, regardless of changes in personnel. The banks are under the (mistaken) impression that they roughly know what to expect, but since you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs, in the end, they’ll be forced to shoulder part of the cost. More to follow soon. The Two Deals of National Bank and EFG Luxembourg The National Bank is going through a period of great activity and the signs indicate that there are already advanced talks for specific projects. However, that doesn’t mean moves will happen on a journalist’s timeline. My column’s information about EFG Luxembourg of Spyros Latsis, which has been circulating in the market lately, is that National did indeed consider the scenario of acquiring it, but decided not to proceed. It was judged that while it would be a major move with substance for National – as it significantly strengthens and shifts balances in the field of private wealth management – it is a deal worth 4.5 billion. Since markets are currently highly volatile and in general we don’t know what tomorrow will bring, a deal of such scale carries significant risks for National. I think it’s a safer bet to expect – soon – some kind of agreement in the insurance sector and another deal in a different direction – most likely abroad. Strong first quarter for OPAP Analysts expect OPAP to announce yet another strong quarter the day after tomorrow (28/5), supported by betting revenue and the steady growth of its online operations. At the same time, revenue from online casinos will continue the excellent performance of recent quarters, while Joker’s strong results—offering the highest jackpot in its history—will also play an important role. AXIA forecasts total gross gaming revenue (GGR) at €584.9 million, up 6.4% year-on-year, EBITDA at €201.1 million (+5.7%), while net profit after minority interests is estimated at €119.6 million (+5.6%). Attention, however, is turning to the upcoming quarters, and AXIA sees challenges on the horizon. Last year’s second half benefited from Euro 2024 and positive betting results, so comparisons in the upcoming quarters are expected to be more demanding. Furthermore, due to the significant rise in the stock (which analysts had not anticipated), surpassing price targets, AXIA states that OPAP’s recommendation and valuation are under review, with an update expected soon. Ungrateful people…Sorras’ coffee maker up for auction? Give us a break Ah, where are the days of Artemis Sorras, who promised to erase Greece’s debt with the… shares of the unforgettable Bank of the East and his $650 billion. Unfortunately, we let that… opportunity go to waste and lost both Sorras and his bizarre business dealings from the spotlight. Those days are so far gone that, as the column has learned, an auction is scheduled for May 30, with the debtor being the (also unforgettable) “non-profit civil company ‘E.SY. – Hellenic Assembly’,” legally represented, with last known headquarters in the municipality of Perama, Attica, at 1 Makedonias Street, now with unknown address. For those with poor memory, this was the party through which Sorras decided to save us—since we refused to save ourselves. Yet, this ungrateful people showed no gratitude at the ballot box, and “Hellenic Assembly” ended up in the dustbin of history. In the meantime, though, it seems they left behind some debts despite the… billions of their leader. So, a private individual is putting the following items up for auction on the 30th: 2 aluminum metal ladders, 8 boxes of brochures, 1 portable radiator, 3 halogen heaters, 1 INOX induction unit, dimensions approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m, 1 professional INOX counter, approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m with three drawers, 1 professional INOX counter with 3 sinks and 2 overlapping cupboard doors, approx. 2.0×1.0x0.8m, 1 EUROCAL wall shelf, 1 MORRIS mini fridge, 1 SILVERCREST coffee maker, 2 two-seater sofas, 1 wooden coffee table with wheels, 1 plastic table with metal base, 1 square melamine table with metal base, 1 white desk, 2 drawer units with 3 drawers each, 1 VERO desktop tower, 1 TURBOX monitor, 1 TURBOX keyboard, 1 REACT amplifier, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 3.0×1.5×0.5m, 12 chairs with wooden back and gray leather seat, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m, 1 shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m with a double-door cupboard, 1 BRΧΑΝΤ A/C unit, 1 whiteboard approx. 1.2×1.0m, 2 white desks with 2 drawers each, 120x80cm, 1 old HP photocopier out of service, 1 HP screen, 1 IBM keyboard, 1 water cooler “NERA KRITIS”, 1 TELEFUNKEN monitor, 1 LG monitor, 1 PACKARD BELL monitor, 17 metal chairs with wood and leather seats, 8 square tables approx. 80x80cm with metal legs, 1 HP computer out of service, 1 small SAMSUNG XPRESS M2675F multifunction printer, 1 bookshelf with 3 shelves and various binders approx. 200x80x50cm, 1 bookshelf with 2 shelves and various binders approx. 160x60x40cm, 1 air conditioner of unknown brand with mirrored grey surface, 1 LG TV remote control, 1 LG air conditioner remote control, 1 YOKOHAMA air conditioner. As noted in the seizure report, “the described movables are old, of average quality, and some of them in poor condition.” Thus, they were all valued together at €500 and will be offered with a starting price of €300. It is further clarified that all this… clutter has been placed “under the custody and safekeeping of the enforcing creditor I. P., due to the difficulty of transporting them,” and remains with him in limbo. What can I add? All… faithful (if any are left), come forth. The talented Mr. Milionis Vasilis Milionis, known from the Energa–Hellas Power case, had active involvement in the energy project of “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” which includes the construction of a natural gas power plant in Larisa, announced with fanfare last week. The investment, worth around €600 million, is being carried out by a consortium including Israeli-owned Clavenia Ltd (38.5%), DEPA Commercial (35%), which joined six months ago, Sirec Energy—a private equity firm via its subsidiary EUSIF Larissa (16.5%)—and Volton (10%). The plant, with a net capacity of 792 MW, is expected, pending the final investment decision, to begin construction in early 2026 and be operational by 2028. In this project, the talented Mr. Milionis is said to have played a key role in its development, as chairman of the board until mid-2021 and later as advisor. I remind you that Vasilis Milionis, who was initially sentenced to 10 years in prison but was acquitted on appeal in 2019, shook the nation 15 years ago with the energy scandal in which he was a central figure. It was then revealed that two private electricity companies (Energa – Hellas Power) were collecting the “property tax” included in electricity bills (EETIDE – predecessor to ENFIA) from customers but were not passing it on to the State—a case for which they were accused of embezzling over €230 million. In May 2021, Milionis was replaced by an Israeli executive at “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” and since then he had disappeared from the energy map. Only to reappear in the medical cannabis business again with the Israelis of Tikun Olam Hellas, reportedly also having a shareholder link to the new Larisa project. Some involved in the project said last week that the Israelis removed him from the ambitious Larisa plan when they realized he was an unacceptable figure in the market and that his name carried a negative connotation. Still, whether Milionis is or isn’t part of the company behind the grand plans for an energy hub in Thessaly (natural gas plant, data center, etc.), I hear that he now shows strong interest in the defense sector. From energy to medical cannabis and now to defense ventures—if nothing else, Milionis seems to have a natural talent for spotting where the money flows! Decisions for 26 projects worth €2.5 billion in Healthcare This afternoon, the Governmental Committee for Projects of National Strategic Importance will convene and—according to information—assign 26 significant projects with a total budget of €2.5 billion to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) and the Strategic Contracts Unit. The government is satisfied with the speed and quality of the projects implemented by the HCAP’s PPF unit in the health sector, which completed 92 renovated hospitals and 160 Health Centers within timelines and budgets. The stock exchange worries only because of its own success By just a tenth of a percentage point (0.10%), the General Index on the Athens Stock Exchange missed the chance to post its 6th consecutive positive week—thanks to Trump and his tariff announcements. Today, with both the London and New York markets closed, the Athens market will move guided solely by the short-term needs of institutional investors, who see the General Index up by +22.64% year-to-date, the Banking Index by +35.63%, and the FTSE25 by +25.57%. The major event of the week comes tomorrow with the annual MSCI review of stock market classifications, with the key question being whether the Greek market will be included in the watchlist for potential reclassification into the Developed Markets category. Inclusion of the Athens Stock Exchange in the watchlist is considered pivotal for fund managers and investment funds active in both Emerging and Developed Markets. News is also expected from Cyprus, not only regarding the large dividend (€0.48/share) from the Bank of Cyprus but also announcements about the future of its shareholder structure. The PotUS’s crafty moves The U.S. President carefully chose the day to announce his ideas about imposing a 50% tax on European products (starting June 1) and at least a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but manufactured abroad. As mentioned, Wall Street is closed today, Monday, for Memorial Day. This was the first time President Trump directly targeted specific companies with tariffs, later stating he would also impose 25% tariffs on Samsung products if not made in the U.S. Americans will have ample time to decide whether Trump is bluffing once again. Market speculators, however, had yet another opportunity to “play” with Trump’s statements. The Dow Jones dropped 256 points (-0.6%). The S&P 500 fell -0.7%. The Nasdaq -1%. All three indices recorded their worst week since April. It’s worth remembering that Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, made large donations to Trump’s Inaugural Fund and attended the Washington event, seated near Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Chairman Jeff Bezos when the colossal $500 billion tech investment plan was unveiled at the end of February. Markets have largely stopped debating the truth of the PotUS’s claims or the real impact of his threats on the growth prospects of the world’s largest economy. What they cannot ignore, however, is the impact they are likely to have on corporate earnings—whether that’s Apple or the countless U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to generate profits. They’re building nuclear batteries for the Moon and Mars Zeno Power Systems has just raised $50 million to build nuclear batteries that work where regular batteries can’t: in the depths of the oceans, the Arctic, in space, and even on the Moon. Zeno Power’s technology uses the decay of radioactive material to generate energy—no sunlight or power outlets required. The company has already signed major contracts with NASA and the U.S. military and secured fuel from the Department of Energy. They’ve added a former Navy chief to their board of directors. The future of energy might not be solar—it might be nuclear, silent, and built for the coldest, darkest places, not just on planet Earth. Explore related questions

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."
