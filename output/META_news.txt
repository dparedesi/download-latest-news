Asian shares are mixed after the S&P 500 ticked to a record and the U.S. dollar's value slid further Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday after the S&P 500 ticked to a record, as the U.S. dollar’s value slid further. Later Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its next move on interest rates. The expectation is that it will hold its main interest rate steady for now. South Korea’s benchmark hit a record, lifted by gains for technology shares like computer chip maker SK Hynix, which climbed 3%. The Kospi was up 1.3% at 5,152.14. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.5% to 53,055.58. The dollar rebounded slightly against the Japanese yen but has still weakened sharply since last week, putting pressure on shares of major exporters. Toyota Motor Corp. lost 3% and other major manufacturers also extended losses. The dollar was trading at 152.75 yen, up from 152.19 yen. But it's nearly 4% lower than its level last week, when it surged to near 160 yen, prompting both Japanese and U.S. officials to warn they will intervene to stanch the yen's decline. The euro slipped to $1.1995 from $1.2041 late Monday. It also has surged against the dollar. An index measuring the U.S. dollar’s strength against several of its competitors has dropped to its lowest point since 2022. The price of gold jumped nearly 3% to surpass $5,200, and silver’s price jumped 9%. Prices of precious metals have been soaring as investors have sold dollars to park their money in assets considered to be relatively safe in times of turmoil. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.4% to 27,782.59, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 4,160.01. Taiwan's Taiex advanced 1.1%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.5%. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks zigzagged following mixed profit reports from UnitedHealth, General Motors and other big companies. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks will deliver their latest earnings reports later this week. They include Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,978.60, edging past its prior all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 49,003.41, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9% to 23,817.10. The dollar has weakened since President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against several European countries that he said opposed his taking control of Greenland. Such threats, along with worries about risks like the U.S. government’s heavy debt, have periodically pushed global investors to step back from U.S. markets, a move that’s come to be called “Sell America.” On Wall Street, Corning helped lead the market higher and climbed 15.6% after announcing a deal with Meta Platforms worth up to $6 billion. Corning will supply optical fiber and cable to help build out data centers for Meta, enough that Corning is expanding its optical-fiber manufacturing facility in Hickory, North Carolina. Also supporting the U.S. stock market were gains for General Motors, which rose 8.7%, and hospital-operator HCA Healthcare, which rallied 7.1%. Both delivered profits for the end of 2025 that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Each also approved programs to send billions of dollars to their investors by buying back their own stock. A report from the Conference Board said confidence weakened among U.S. consumers last month. Economists had expected to see a slight improvement, but confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2014, even lower than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, and lower interest rates could worsen increases in prices for U.S. consumers at the same time that they give the economy a boost. Traders expect the Fed to resume its cuts to interest rates later this year. The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits following record-setting runs for their stock prices. Stock prices tend to follow the path of corporate profits over the long term, and earnings need to rise to quiet criticism that stock prices have grown too expensive. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 42 cents to $62.81 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 34 cents at $66.93 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: NZ sharemarket falls as inflation jump stokes interest rate hike fears – Market close

The New Zealand sharemarket took on a cautious tone and fell nearly 1% as inflation creeps up on both sides of the Tasman and creates fears of interest rate hikes. The S&P/NZX 50 Index was on a downward slide all day and closed at 13,412.87, declining 98.01 points or 0.73%. There were 49 gainers and 83 decliners on the main board, with 33.09 million shares worth $114.98 million changing hands. Things got nervy after the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that Australia’s annual inflation increased to 3.8% at the end of December, from 3.4% recorded in November. This followed the New Zealand inflation increase from 3% to 3.1% in the December quarter – the highest annual rate since the June 2024 quarter, when it was 3.3%. Mark Lister, investment director with Craigs Investment Partners, said “inflation is not dead and buried – it’s lower than it was but still higher than we want it to be”. He said the market has firmed up an expectation of an interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week, and “we could see a hike here sooner than we thought, even before the end of the year”. Lister said the market was weaker because of the inflation surprises over the past week and some key events that will be happening over the next 24 hours. The US Federal Reserve is meeting and is expected to keep interest rates on hold. “There is a lot of focus on the Fed with the Justice Department investigation and chair Jerome Powell’s term expiring in May,” Lister said. “We’ve got the latest earnings results from Apple, Meta [the Facebook parent] and Tesla, and investors are eagerly awaiting how they will look. Gold continues to power ahead and the US dollar is out of favour – there’s plenty of reasons to be a little cautious.” The gold price was up a further 3% to US$5240 an ounce, and the New Zealand dollar was back over US60c against the American greenback, trading at US60.16c after reaching an intraday high of US60.5c. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reached a new high after increasing 0.41% to 6978.6 points and nearly breaching the historic 7000 mark. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.91% to 23,817.1 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, weighed down by the health insurance stocks, declined 0.83% to 49,003.41. Across the Tasman, the S&P/ASX 200 Index was down 0.18% to 8925.1 points at 6pm NZT. Back home, Ebos Group continued to be sold off, falling 65c or 2.44% to $26 – the stock was last at that level in October 2020. Infratil was down 18c to $10.97; Summerset declined 24c or 2.05% to $11.49; Skellerup shed 8c to $5.20; Sky TV decreased 6c or 1.77% to $3.33; and Eroad fell 6c or 4.55% to $1.26. In the retail sector, Hallenstein Glasson was up 10c to $9.70, and Briscoe Group was down 13c or 2.55% to $4.97. The property sector on the market slumped 1.84% as bond yields continued to rise. The New Zealand 10-Year Government Bond yield was up slightly to 4.637% and the 2 Year to 3.38%. Goodman Property Trust declined 4.5c or 2.28% to $1.925; Investore was down 2c or 1.75% to $1.12; Kiwi Property decreased 2.5c or 2.43% to $1.005; and Precinct Properties shed 2.5c or 2.14% to $1.14. Argosy Property was down 2.5c or 2.06% to $1.19; Vital Healthcare Trust also eased 2.5c to $1.96, and Stride and Property for Industry decreased 2c to $1.30 and $2.31, respectively. Green Cross Health increased 7c or 5.69% to $1.30, and Blackpearl Group was up 3.5c or 3.55% to $1.02. Dual-listed Minerals Exploration was down 2c or 6.67% to 28c after telling the market it has started test drilling at the flagship Waitekauri Jubilee gold mine near Waihī after collecting rock chip samples at the Scotia prospect. The company said the Waitekauri project is 8km west of OceanaGold’s Waihī Gold Mine and in the centre of a heavily gold-mineralised structural corridor. Minerals Exploration had $4.5m in cash at the end of December. Fellow miner Santana Minerals rebounded 11c or 8.94% to $1.34. Cooks Coffee, with outlets in Britain and Ireland, was up 1.5c or 6.98% to 23c after announcing it is expanding its Esquires chain to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including Dubai. Cooks has organised an initial 10-year master franchise agreement with the UAE, providing a minimum total of 50 Esquires Coffee outlets during that period.

Title: A Meta deal just turned this 175-year-old company into a linchpin of the AI data center boom

You might know Corning for its iconic kitchen brands, like Pyrex and CorningWare. You might remember that Thomas Edison relied on the company to develop glass for the light bulb, or that in 1970, Corning invented the first glass fiber that was useful for long-distance communication, while in 2007 Steve Jobs turned to Corning, which is based in Corning, N.Y., to create the hard-to-shatter glass that now wraps every iPhone. You probably don’t think of it as an AI company, but a new deal with Meta shows how radically the AI boom is reshaping America’s industrial landscape. The 175-year-old Corning, a longtime fixture of the Fortune 500, has reinvented itself once again—this time as a critical supplier to the world’s largest AI data centers. Meta announced today that it has committed to paying Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable to wire its expanding fleet of AI data centers. In a CNBC interview, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks disclosed that Corning is expanding a North Carolina manufacturing facility to accommodate growing demand from Meta and other companies including Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. When the project is complete—with funding from Meta—Corning says it will be the largest fiber-optic cable plant in the world. The news today sent Corning’s stock soaring 16%. Instead of sending information as electrical signals through copper wire, fiber uses strands of ultra-pure glass—each one thinner than a human hair—to carry data as pulses of light. In AI data centers, fiber-optic cable links tens of thousands of GPUs, allowing them to function as a single supercomputer cluster. Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told Fortune the Meta deal is “big” for Corning, likely doubling its annual revenue from that one deal alone from under a half-billion to closer to a billion per year once the plant is fully ramped up. The deal also likely won’t be the last one for Corning, as hyperscalers look to lock in supply. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see Microsoft do a similar Corning deal, because a lot of these data center investors are moving past plant construction, and they really fear that shortages are going to show up once they get to that next stage,” Boloor said. As my colleague Kristin Stoller reported in Fortune last year, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Corning. In the 1990s, Weeks was a Corning vice president tapped to run a new optical fiber business to power the burgeoning internet—an innovation that drove Corning’s valuation to nearly $100 billion at the height of the internet bubble in 2000. That bubble burst the following year, sending the company’s stock price plummeting from some $100 to $1. But even when Corning lost 99% of its value and had to lay off half its employees, Weeks continued to develop the company’s fiber tech, which is continuing to pay off during the AI data center boom. Over the past six months, Corning’s stock has risen over 100%. The Meta deal comes at a moment when power has become the biggest bottleneck for hyperscalers, said Boloor, pushing companies to do everything they can to work around a constraint that is only getting worse. Today’s AI data centers pack racks of GPUs that must be physically connected at what he calls “insane speeds.” “Electricity does not move through air, and data does not teleport between racks—the power flows through copper, and the data flows through fiber,” he explained. As AI inference—the day-to-day output of models—booms, the “amount of fiber per data center is going to explode.”

Title: Meta's soaring capex is front and center for analysts ahead of the social media giant's Q4 earnings

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the case for his company's continued AI expansion — and its need to continue scaling infrastructure — after Meta's fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday included a revenue beat but higher-than-expected capital spending. The company delivered $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of last year, beating Wall Street's estimate of $58.41 billion. Earnings per share came in at $8.88 versus expectations of $8.19. The stock was up over 8% in after-hours trading. On capex, Meta said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026, compared to estimates for $110.62 billion. On the call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Meta was a "deep technology company" that should pursue its own frontier model rather than rely on others' APIs. As for the superintelligence lab, Zuckerberg gave the "unfulfilling" answer that he was optimistic about the future. Ultimately, ads are still the center of Meta's business — and Zuckerberg acknowledged it. One analyst asked whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, but that ads will continue to be Meta's "driver of growth" for the next couple of years. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q4 earnings call with analysts below: In her final response, Li says that Meta AI is popular where Meta's apps are popular. In India and Indonesia, Meta AI engagement is driven by WhatsApp, whereas in the US, it is driven by Facebook. "We see a lot of opportunity to make it easier for people to accomplish the tasks that they already come to our services for every day," Li says. Does Meta need a general-purpose model? The space is crowded, from OpenAI to Anthropic to xAI. Zuckerberg says Meta is a "deep technology" company — more than just the apps for which it's known. He said he thinks that frontier models will not always be available via an API in the future. That means it's important for Meta to have its own frontier model, Zuckerberg says.

He said he thinks that frontier models will not always be available via an API in the future. That means it's important for Meta to have its own frontier model, Zuckerberg says. "We're clearly extremely focused on this," he says. Ross Sandler of Barclays asks about Meta's plan for Horizon Worlds. Zuckerberg responds that in the future, there will be lots of "interactive and immersive content." He imagines a future where people can easily create a game with a prompt and then jump into it. Users would also be able to share these AI-generated games on their feed, Zuckerberg says, so their friends can enter them, too. Ross Sandler of Barclays asks about Meta's plan for Horizon Worlds.

Users would also be able to share these AI-generated games on their feed, Zuckerberg says, so their friends can enter them, too. Last quarter, the word "metaverse" was not uttered on Meta's earnings call. Meta's ads business is still doing most of the heavy lifting, and Zuckerberg isn't pretending otherwise. On the earnings call, Bank of America analyst Justin Post pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, Meta is focused on building new businesses, but stressed that "for the next couple of years, ads are going to be our driver of growth." Meta's ads business is still doing most of the heavy lifting, and Zuckerberg isn't pretending otherwise. On the earnings call, Bank of America analyst Justin Post pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, Meta is focused on building new businesses, but stressed that "for the next couple of years, ads are going to be our driver of growth." He framed it as a balancing act. Meta wants to pursue new revenue streams, while also "investing very heavily" to ensure its AI work improves both the quality of its apps and the performance of its core ad business. Zuckerberg added that even if new initiatives scale quickly, they'll still take time to matter at the size of Meta's ads engine. Meta's claims of capacity constraints don't seem to square with its plans to start leasing out data center space. Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs pointed out the contradiction, and Susan Li answered: "We expect over the course of 2026 to have significantly more capacity this year as we add cloud, but we'll likely still be constrained through much of 2026 until additional capacity from our own facilities comes online later in the year." It's an "unfulfilling time" to talk about Meta's Superintelligence Labs, Zuckerberg says. It's a "long-term effort," which Meta is about six months into, Zuckerberg says. "I'm quite optimistic," he says. There is a "big delta" between those who use agents and those who don't, Zuckerberg says. Agents can make employees "significantly more productive," he says. Zuckerberg hopes that the company can use AI to "get a lot more done." Meta is still capacity-constrained, Li says. Demands for compute and resources have increased "even faster" than supply. Li expects that Meta will remain constrained until additional capacity from its own facilities becomes available later in the year. Li says that "legal and regulatory headwinds" in the EU and US could affect the business. She points to scrutiny over "youth-related issues." There are trials scheduled for this year in the US, which may result in a "material loss," Li says. Meta finished 2025 with the high-profile acquisition of Manus, an agentic AI startup based in Singapore but with roots in China. Regulators in China said this month that they would review the deal. That could cause a headache for Meta, which says it plans to integrate Manus' technology into its existing platforms, at a time when it's looking for a boost in the AI race. Zuckerberg says that connecting recommendations and LLMs will improve the advertising experience. There will be opportunities around Meta AI, Zuckerberg says. He is excited about movements in "shopping in commerce," as well as advances to Meta's models. Zuckerberg says that connecting recommendations and LLMs will improve the advertising experience. There will be opportunities around Meta AI, Zuckerberg says. He is excited about movements in "shopping in commerce," as well as advances to Meta's models. Zuckerberg points to the Manus acquisition. Businesses already pay Manus to use their tools, he says. Now, Meta can incorporate those tools. Meta wants "long-term flexibility" as it spends significantly on infrastructure. The company is changing how it develops data center sites and establishing new ownership structures for some large data centers, Li says. Meta will have sufficient cash to fund its 2026 infrastructure bets, Li says. Meta continues to roll out its AI business assistant. More advertisers will be able to chat with the assistant in the coming months, Li says. AI can also help advertisers on the creative side. The combined revenue run rate of its video generation tool hit $10 billion in Q4, Li says. Zuckerberg is pitching 2026 as a turning point for how work gets done inside Meta, and he's explicitly tying it to a leaner org. On the company's earnings call, he said Meta is "investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done." Zuckerberg is pitching 2026 as a turning point for how work gets done inside Meta, and he's explicitly tying it to a leaner org. On the company's earnings call, he said Meta is "investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done." He said Meta is already seeing "projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person." Worth noting: While Meta ended 2025 with 78,865 employees (up 6% from the same time last year), the company has said this growth is concentrated in technical hires for priority areas like its AI push. In other words, Meta is betting that fewer elite engineers, armed with new AI tools, can do more with less. Meta is in "early testing" for its AI personalization effort, Li says. It is investing heavily in new architecture for its recommendation system, building "on top of LLMs." Its AI translation tool is also going strong, dubbing mobile videos into nine different languages. AI-translated videos have hundreds of millions of views, Li says. Zuckerberg said Meta will dive into "agentic shopping" across its apps. "Today, our systems help people stay in touch with friends," Zuckerberg said. "But soon we'll be able to understand people's unique personal goals and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want." Zuckerberg said Meta will dive into "agentic shopping" across its apps. "Today, our systems help people stay in touch with friends," Zuckerberg said. "But soon we'll be able to understand people's unique personal goals and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want." Meta's agentic commerce tools "will allow people to find just the right, very specific, set of products from the businesses in our catalog," Zuckerberg said. AI-powered agentic commerce has been a hot topic in Silicon Valley. Google is an unsurprising player in the space, while platforms like Pinterest are also building out more AI shopping tools. In-app shopping was previously a big focus for Meta-owned Instagram, but the platform sidelined some of its initiatives, including sunsetting its dedicated shopping tab. Meta blew past analyst expectations for full-year capex, coming in at $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the full year. Wall Street shouldn't be surprised capex was higher than expected. Meta's spending has crept up and up and up in the last year as it shells out on data centers.

Wall Street shouldn't be surprised capex was higher than expected. Meta's spending has crept up and up and up in the last year as it shells out on data centers. The company expects 2026 capex to range from $115 billion to $135 billion. Meta ended the fourth quarter with 78,800 employees, up 6% year-over-year, CFO Susan Li says. The head count increase was driven by hiring in "priority areas" including monetization, infrastructure, and Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2026 will be "the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work," Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg plans to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams at Meta. A "single, very talented person" can now do what a big team used to handle, he says. 2026 will be "the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work," Zuckerberg says.

Zuckerberg says he wants to make sure Meta attracts those talented people. Zuckerberg expects an "explosion of new media formats" thanks to AI. Our feeds will be more "interactive." Glasses are the "ultimate incarnation" of this vision, Zuckerberg says. Sales of Meta's AI glasses more than tripled in 2025, he says. He compared AI glasses to the rise of smartphones, emerging out of flip phones. Zuckerberg expects an "explosion of new media formats" thanks to AI. Our feeds will be more "interactive."

Mark Zuckerberg says we are in an "AI acceleration." Agents are starting to "really work," he says. Meta will soon start shipping "new models and products" in AI, Zuckerberg says. He expects that the first models will be "good," but that Meta will push the frontier as it rolls out more models throughout 2026. Meta's Reality Labs division, the unit responsible for its virtual and augmented reality efforts, remains a massive financial drain. It lost over $6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025 and a staggering $19.19 billion over the year. Earlier this month, Meta cut roughly 1,500 Reality Labs employees — about 10% of the division's workforce — and shuttered several VR gaming studios that it had acquired. Meta plans to deprioritize VR in favor of AI-powered wearables such as smart glasses. In a recent interview, Meta's chief technology officer and Reality Labs head, Andrew Bosworth, acknowledged that VR is "growing less quickly than we hoped."

Earlier this month, Meta cut roughly 1,500 Reality Labs employees — about 10% of the division's workforce — and shuttered several VR gaming studios that it had acquired. Meta plans to deprioritize VR in favor of AI-powered wearables such as smart glasses. In a recent interview, Meta's chief technology officer and Reality Labs head, Andrew Bosworth, acknowledged that VR is "growing less quickly than we hoped." Investors looking for a reprieve from the spending will likely be disappointed. Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in the earnings report that the company expects 2026 Reality Labs operating losses to remain "similar to 2025 levels." It's all happening. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are on the call and will begin with reading prepared remarks. Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, highlighted the gap between Meta's business performance and market expectations about AI spending. "While Meta's strong ad growth demonstrates the core business remains healthy, investors are clearly signaling concerns that its aggressive AI spending may pressure profitability," Cohen said.

"While Meta's strong ad growth demonstrates the core business remains healthy, investors are clearly signaling concerns that its aggressive AI spending may pressure profitability," Cohen said. Meta's ad impressions and average price-per-ad were both up year-over-year for 2025, at 12% and 9%, respectively. Meta's 2026 free cash flow could be squeezed as the company pours more money into AI infrastructure, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. He estimated capital spending could run at 45% to 55% of revenue, which he called the highest "capital-outlay intensity" among the major hyperscalers. Singh added that the pressure is exacerbated because Reality Labs' recent cuts have been relatively modest: about 10% (roughly $2 billion), rather than the 30% some investors had expected.

There are also questions about how quickly Meta can turn its AI investment into revenue. Singh said that Meta AI's stand-alone app, as well as its Vibes AI-video feed, still trails ChatGPT and Gemini on the consumer side. In Meta's CFO outlook, the company said it expected talent compensation would be the second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026. It only ranked below infrastructure costs. The compensation growth is driven by "investments in technical talent," including 2026 hires to priority areas like AI, as well as expenses from 2025 hires.

It helped drive a talent war among other leading AI companies — including OpenAI and Anthropic — by offering large paychecks and signing bonuses. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Meta's executives will be keen to emphasize that its ads business still has plenty of room to grow. Some of that will come from Meta harnessing AI to continue to fine-tune its precision ad-targeting models. Advertisers reward performance with bigger budgets. Analysts at Evercore wrote in a January 25 research note that one ad buyer had seen a 4% lift in return on investment from Meta ads last year.

Analysts at Evercore wrote in a January 25 research note that one ad buyer had seen a 4% lift in return on investment from Meta ads last year. Another positive sign for Meta's ad business will be if it continues to increase the surfaces on which it sells ads. Case in point: Last week, Meta said it's rolling out ads on Threads globally to all users. And, as a side note, let's not forget that Meta is a major advertiser in its own right. Meta's back in the Super Bowl next month with two ads showcasing its Meta Oakley AI glasses, which might get a shout-out later on. Meta is in "somewhat of an awkward phase," Raymond James' Josh Beck and other analysts wrote in a note on Monday. They dubbed the company an "AI Tweener" as investors await progress updates on Meta's Llama and its other proprietary AI models. Beck also highlighted AI-powered agentic commerce as an opportunity for Meta. Meta is in "somewhat of an awkward phase," Raymond James' Josh Beck and other analysts wrote in a note on Monday. They dubbed the company an "AI Tweener" as investors await progress updates on Meta's Llama and its other proprietary AI models. Beck also highlighted AI-powered agentic commerce as an opportunity for Meta. With an AI shopping assistant, Meta could leverage Reels and influencers to spark "'inspired shopping' journeys" on its platforms, Beck wrote. At the same time, if other companies move ahead on agentic shopping, that could pose a threat if "consumers flock" elsewhere. Meta's recent cuts in Reality Labs are a late admission that the metaverse was a bad bet, Mike Proulx, Forrester vice president and research director, told Business Insider. By trimming Reality Labs, "Meta can better focus on its AI ambitions, especially as Gemini tries to usurp the personal intelligence space," Proulx said.

By trimming Reality Labs, "Meta can better focus on its AI ambitions, especially as Gemini tries to usurp the personal intelligence space," Proulx said. Proulx also flagged several potential headwinds for 2026, including constraints in businesses where Meta has momentum. Demand for Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses has outpaced supply, making international expansion difficult, he says. He also said that the TikTok deal in the US could keep the pressure on Reels, its closest competitor. "And let's not forget how Meta closed its Q3 earnings call with an ominous warning about regulatory hurdles in 2026 that 'may ultimately result in a material loss,'" Proulx added. One bright spot, according to Proulx? The recent reports that Threads has overtaken Elon Musk's X in daily active mobile users. Google pulled off a mighty turnaround in 2025, culminating in it reaching a $4 trillion market cap this month. The stock is up 72% in the last year. Like Google, Meta has a big distribution advantage thanks to its billions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook users. So, how is it going to use them in the AI race?

Bernstein's Mark Shmulik wrote in a Tuesday note that one of his key themes for this year is a change in "winner" criteria from model quality to product usage. Good news for Meta, then. Investors will be listening closely for clues about how Zuck and co are going to bring irresistible AI-driven features to Meta's vast empire of users, creators, advertisers, and businesses. "Meta remains one of our top picks for 2026 and could well see a story similar to Google 2025," Shmulik wrote. Investors are in a "holding pattern" to see if Meta's next big AI model is a blockbuster event, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a note on Tuesday. With Meta's next model, codenamed "Avocado," rumored to launch this spring, we'll be listening out for any hints at what it might bring. Meta's family of AI models, known as Llama, has so far received a lukewarm reception, but even if the new offerings aren't enough to put Meta in the leading pack, Shmulik posits it may not be a disaster so long as Meta can pair with another lab for its models.

TD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting that generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business. Analyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.

Analyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending. "Key at the 4Q25 print will be mgmt's '26 capex and opex guides," he said. "We currently expect '26 capex of $125.0BN, up 76% y/y and 14% above consensus alongside '26 opex of $156.1BN, up 32.9% y/y and 7% above consensus." Rothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 35% increase from levels on Wednesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand. "The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure," he stated. "The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost."

Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates. "On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI," Goldman analysts stated. Deutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses. That said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Just Doubled Down on AI Again

Investing Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi exercised options in Vistra (VST) and Tempus AI (TEM) as part of $69M in trades. Vistra supplies power to AI data centers and struck deals with Meta Platforms covering 2,600+ megawatts. Tempus AI applies AI to precision medicine in oncology and cardiology. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi is often portrayed as the most successful stock trader in Congress, having built a substantial fortune largely through well-timed investments in technology stocks. Her trading record has drawn intense scrutiny over the years, with critics alleging that she and other lawmakers may benefit from insights tied to their official oversight roles. Many of the trades occurred just prior to significant events benefiting the company and its stock. While no wrongdoing has been proven, every new trade tends to attract outsized attention from investors. That attention spiked again last week when Pelosi’s latest stock trade report was released. The report showed that she continues to increase her exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), pairing large sales of long-held stocks with fresh option exercises and purchases tied to AI-driven companies. In total, the filing reflected roughly $69 million in transaction value, with the trades executed by her husband, Paul Pelosi. In the Jan. 23 filing, Pelosi reported sizable sales in several familiar names. The most significant was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for a large portion of the total dollar value disclosed. She also sold smaller but still meaningful stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). Together, these moves reduced direct exposure to some of the portfolio’s most established tech and media holdings. Apple’s sale stood out as a classic profit-taking move, especially given the stock’s elevated valuation. Nvidia’s sale was more surprising, considering its central role in powering AI workloads. Meanwhile, exiting Disney suggests a broader shift away from traditional entertainment toward faster-growing technology-driven opportunities. Those sales were balanced by option exercises and purchases in several mega-cap technology companies. Pelosi exercised 50 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) call options, originally purchased on January 14, 2025, at a $150 strike price, resulting in a transaction valued between $500,001 and $1,000,000. A nearly identical move was made in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), also exercising 50 calls at a $150 strike within the same value range. Nvidia appeared again on the buy side, with the exercise of 50 call options purchased in January 2025 at an $80 strike, valued between $250,001 and $500,000. These exercises converted previously held options into shares, preserving exposure to the companies most closely tied to cloud computing and AI infrastructure. Notably, Nvidia illustrates a recurring pattern: selling shares while simultaneously using options to regain exposure. This strategy allows investors to lock in gains or reduce risk on existing holdings, while still positioning the portfolio for gains through options. Because options offer leveraged exposure with defined risk, this approach can help manage portfolio concentration while maintaining a bullish outlook. Beyond megacap tech, the filing highlighted targeted bets on AI-adjacent industries. Pelosi exercised options in Vistra (NYSE:VST), an energy company increasingly tied to AI data center demand. Vistra supplies nuclear and natural gas power to energy-hungry AI facilities and has struck major deals, including agreements with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) covering more than 2,600 megawatts. Its recent $4 billion acquisition of gas plants further positions it to benefit from AI-driven electricity demand. She also exercised 50 call options in Tempus AI (NASDAQ: TEM) — valued between $50,001 and $100,000 — from options purchased in January 2025 at a $20 strike. That initial purchase rocketed Tempus to the forefront of investor consciousness and caused its stock to soar. Tempus applies AI to precision medicine, using large datasets to improve diagnostics and treatment decisions in fields like oncology, cardiology, and radiology. Taken together, these trades reflect continued confidence in AI’s long-term growth. By trimming mature tech positions and redeploying capital into AI leaders and enablers such as Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Vistra, and Tempus, the portfolio tilts toward areas likely to see sustained demand from AI adoption. The focus on energy infrastructure and AI-driven healthcare also suggests that the next phase of AI growth may extend well beyond software, reaching into the physical and practical systems that make AI possible.

Title: Virtuix Goes Public During a Turbulent Moment for Consumer VR

Time Published: 2026-01-27T14:49:42Z

VR treadmill creator Virtuix is going public, as its Class A ordinary shares will start trading today on the Global Market tier of the Nasdaq. The company’s stock market debut comes as consumer VR investment and first-party content spending have slowed across the industry. Founded in 2013 by CEO Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix initially started its journey on Kickstarter with the launch of the original Omni, which garnered $1.1 million from backers. While the company first started out with pretty clear ambitions to enter the consumer market, market realities pushed the company into the out-of-home VR attraction space, forcing it to navigate a significant pivot in its business strategy. Since then, the Austin, Texas-based company has attracted over $55 million in funding from major investors such as Mark Cuban, Maveron, and Scout Ventures, with its latest crowd investment campaign bringing in an additional $3.3 million. Virtuix still sells its enterprise-focused ‘Arena’ solution, however the company made it next big bet by reentering the consumer market with the release of Omni One in 2024, which can be purchased as a full system (Pico headset included) for $3,500, or a bring-your-own PC VR headset system priced at $2,600. Alongside its Nasdaq debut, which is trading under the ticker ‘VTIX’, Virtuix secured an additional $11 million investment from Chicago Venture Partners and established a $50 million equity line of credit, subject to conditions. The company says it plans to use the funding to scale sales of Omni One. “We’re only getting started,” said Goetgeluk. “In a world where we explore increasingly photorealistic virtual worlds, the missing piece is the ability to move through those worlds naturally. We pioneered the technology to make that possible. Going public provides us with access to capital to fund our growth and develop new products.” It’s an interesting time as a consumer-focused VR company to go public, what with Meta’s pullback from the VR games space following the reorganization of its Reality Labs, which saw a reported 10 percent headcount reduction. Granted, that focus is more on the high-end consumer, which likely includes a significant overlap with enterprise. Still, Virtuix’s performance in the market will serve as an important data point as the next phase of consumer VR takes root—i.e. a moment when platform holder dollars have all but stopped flowing into the games ecosystem. After all, it’s one of very few publicly traded companies specializing solely in VR hardware right now that isn’t a major platform holder. That said, it’s a pretty grim time for XR studios right now, as it seems investment dollars for big single-player content has dried up amid a flourishing of free-to-play multiplayer games on the medium’s dominant platform, Meta Quest 3. I’m also waiting to see how Valve’s Steam Frame fares, which still doesn’t have a price or specific release date yet. This comes alongside the closure of three first-party Meta studios, Sanzaru Games (Asgard’s Wrath), Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR port) and Twisted Pixel (Deadpool VR) in addition to layoffs at a number of veteran XR studios, including Mighty Coconut (Walkabout Mini Golf) and Cloudhead Games (Pistol Whip).

Well the fact you can buy it without a headset now makes it more appealing to me. I have a Kat core 2 got for $600 with 2.4 km on it. Hard to beat that price. Not sure an extra 2500$ is worth the money. Turbulent moment for consumer VR? What do you mean? The VR fanboys keep telling me that VR gaming just keeps on growing and growing, it's never been better! @nl_vr If you play flat screen games you are a dinosaur! VR gaming is now dominating! LoL tryed to ping me on these type of boards just show how unknown you are to how things work and what a bully you are. So pathetic when you can't win arguments you go over to personal insults When do you think Sony will reveal the PSVR3? Yadda yadda yadda Well, good luck!

Title: Tech's massive AI spend is under scrutiny ahead of earnings. Here's what to watch

Title: Big Tech earnings and a Fed meeting are setting up a potentially game-changing week for investors

Seemingly every day, the president is doing something new to stir up volatility in various asset classes and stock-market sectors. We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus. That's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into. Here are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each. This gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no "will-they / won't-they" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here. What traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas, Market significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka "selling America.") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?) If Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market. This week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday. Market significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter. Apple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership. Tesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown. Jump to

Title: Asian shares track Wall Street gains as gold edges lower

Asian shares have mostly gained after U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after U.S. stock indexes ticked upward, buoyed by strong profit reports for some companies. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to 53,333.54. The Kospi in South Korea surged 2.7% to 5,084.85, even after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods because the country’s national assembly has yet to approve a trade framework announced last year. South Korea’s presidential office responded after a meeting of top officials that it will convey its commitment to implementing last year’s deal to the U.S. The presidential office said that South Korea’s Industry Minister Kim Jung-Kwan will travel to the U.S. for talks with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, while Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo will travel separately to meet with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Kim was on a visit to Canada. Trump said on social media Monday that import taxes would be raised on autos, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs from South Korea with the rate on other goods going from 15% to 25%. Gains for Korean tech-related shares like Samsung Electronics, which rose 4.9% and chip maker SK Hynix, which soared 8.7%, helped offset losses for automakers. Kia Corp. fell 1.1% and Hyundai Motor Co. lost 0.8%. Chinese markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3% to 27,106.83 and the Shanghai Composite index added 0.2% to 4,139.90. But the benchmark for the smaller market in Shenzhen dropped 0.1%. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.8%, while India's Sensex edged 0.1% higher. The future for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% lower. On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, winning back its losses from last week’s dip to close at 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6% to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.4% to 23,601.36. Financial markets could face more swings in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its stance on interest rates on Wednesday, when it is expected to hold steady. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver earnings reports. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In Monday trading, Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, helped by strong demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. But Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. In other dealings early Tuesday, the price of gold resumed its climb, adding 0.2% to $5,089.70 per ounce. On Monday, it rallied 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time. Silver lost 2.6%. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The dollar rose to 154.56 Japanese yen from 154.20 yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1873 from $1.1881. U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 25 cents to $60.38 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 30 cents to $64.47 per barrel. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: WaPo’s Woes; TTD’s C-Suite Turnover
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/tuesday-27012026/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T05:01:53Z

Who Needs Sports? The Washington Post is bracing for massive layoffs that have employees questioning owner Jeff Bezos’s commitment to the newspaper’s long-term health, Status reports. WaPo reportedly plans to slash 100 of its 800 newsroom positions next month, with the cuts likely to primarily impact the sports, metro and foreign news teams. In total, 300 positions may be eliminated across the company. Why the layoffs? WaPo’s advertising and subscription businesses have been struggling for years. WaPo infamously lost a quarter million digital subscribers, or 10% of its subscriber base, after Bezos spiked the paper’s planned endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election. As of June, its paid print circulation was just 97,000. On top of that, Johanna Mayer-Jones, WaPo’s ad chief, was reportedly eyeing an exit back in October – although she’s still currently with the company. The decision to focus newsroom layoffs on the sports desk bodes ill for WaPo’s turnaround prospects. Its major news rivals, including The New York Times, have doubled down on sports as a way to attract advertisers that are hesitant about appearing beside hard news coverage. Oh, and the layoffs are expected to hit just as the Winter Olympics are set to begin in February. Stock In Trade The Trade Desk is dealing with all sorts of in-the-weeds programmatic drama. There’s its fierce rivalry with Amazon putting pressure on margins, not to mention in-fighting with Prebid over transaction IDs. But there’s another issue: TTD’s leadership churn. Programmatic vets surely took note of Jud Spencer’s departure in December and CRO Jed Dederick’s exit not long before that. Meanwhile, the COO role was unfilled for years before Vivek Kundra came aboard last year. And there hasn’t been a CTO since Dave Pickles left in 2023. Now, Alex Kayyal, who joined as CFO only six months ago, is stepping down, Adweek reports. TTD also had another CFO transition 18 months prior. The Trade Desk’s CFO turnover may not ring all that loudly in the programmatic space, but Wall Street investors consider it an important signal. And, indeed, TTD’s shares dropped by more than 6% after the announcement. In a research note, Wells Fargo wrote that the news about Kayyal only adds to TTD’s “continued fundamental and narrative volatility.” Losing the narrative, as they say, barely registers in third-party programmatic. Favorable headlines about Amazon DSP can stack to the sky without much affecting TTD’s actual performance. But when the Wall Street narrative breaks, it goes straight to the market cap. The Ads Add Up Few places are pricier to run ads than the Las Vegas Sphere or during an NFL game – unless, apparently, you’re buying a placement in ChatGPT. That’s right. Scarcely a week after OpenAI announced its plan to launch ads in the coming weeks, ChatGPT has reportedly set a baseline CPM of approximately $60, according to The Information. That price rivals some of the most coveted inventory out there. Sixty bucks would be at the high end for a YouTube campaign, while CPMs on Meta, by comparison, are often in the $10 to $20 range. And OpenAI doesn’t even have an attribution or a pixel network to track and credit conversions. On the other hand, recall that Netflix launched with a $60 CPM baseline, which has long since rationalized to $30 or less. Being among the earliest advertisers in ChatGPT will no doubt carry some bragging rights, sure. Just imagine all the screenshots and organic sharing those ads will generate. Still, The Information writes, with OpenAI’s ads business in its infancy, “many advertisers will likely hold off on devoting significant parts of their budgets to ChatGPT ads until they see whether those ads are driving sales.” Not everyone is willing to shell out for a shiny object. But Wait! There’s More! Inside the debate over agentic advertising and standards. [Digiday] How MrBeast Burger, the YouTuber’s eponymous food and delivery brand, went so very wrong. [Business Insider] The European Commission is investigating whether X’s Grok chatbot violates the Digital Services Act’s rules on illegal content sharing. The EC also extended its ongoing probe into X’s recommendation engine. [release] WPP Media introduced a new suite of “Super Agents” within its AI marketing platform, WPP Open. [release] Data suggests that YouTube has overtaken Reddit as the most frequently cited social platform in AI-generated responses from large language models. [Adweek]

U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets.

That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: Coffee Break: Oracle Debt and TikTok Transition Troubles Vex the Ellison Media Empire
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2026/01/oracle-tiktok-ellisons-finances-debt-media-empire-algorithm.html
Time Published: 2026-01-26T19:00:12Z
Full Content:
Oracle and TikTok are overshadowing the problems at Bari Weiss’ CBS News this week. Larry and David Ellison are attempting to create a massive multi-channel media empire with reach across multiple demographics and the scale and synergy to build something more than the sum of its parts. Larry Ellison’s database behemoth, Oracle, provides the financial foundation beneath the aspiring media empire. TikTok is the shiny new acquisition that gives the Ellisons’ hasbara-enforcing empire its reach into the Zoomer demographic and its algorithmic influence over what that demo sees… and perhaps thinks. Combined with the Paramount TV network and Hollywood studio empire that Père Larry bought for fils David, Oracle’s 15% share in the American version of TikTok was supposed to make the Ellisons kingmakers and resistance breakers. But, as I’ve posted before, empire building ain’t easy. This week, financial problems at the foundational level and technical problems at TikTok are vexing the imperial Ellisons. Ed Zitron Goes for the Kill In the latest premium-subscriber-only edition of his newsletter Where’s Your Ed At?, Ed Zitron argues that “the AI bubble means that every single participant, without exception, is operating on borrowed time.” Most of the issue is spent explaining how doomed OpenAI is, the way GPU accountancy guarantees the hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google) will be facing massive depreciation write-downs (and possibly even impairments) for the foreseeable future, and outlining various scenarios explaining what may happen if and when OpenAI fails. But he saves a big passage at the very end for Oracle. Yet the biggest loser, I believe, will be Oracle – a company saddled with debt and hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term obligations due to its participation in the AI bubble, and a software business that’s rancid and decaying. https://t.co/tAWxEv0NzD pic.twitter.com/fRMEnoE3Lc — Ed Zitron (@edzitron) January 23, 2026 Some key quotes: I cannot express how stupid Oracle is. It signed a $300 billion deal with OpenAI back in September of last year that requires 4.5GW of capacity that Oracle does not have, and has taken on $248 billion in lease obligations on top of it. Oracle does not have the cash to support these operations. It had negative $13 billion in cash flow last quarter, raised $18 billion in bonds, that $38 billion debt package for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin has yet to close, and Blue Owl — the loosest legs in data center funding — pulled out of Stargate Michigan in December, with nobody else stepping up to the plate as of writing this sentence. Here’s the thing: for any of this to work, OpenAI has to become profitable within the space of two years, and do so at a scale where it is able to afford $30 billion or more a quarter in compute costs. To give you some context, Microsoft Azure makes around $75 billion annually, and AWS $115 billion. OpenAI, in its best-case scenario, made around $13 billion this year, and Oracle will be charging it at least $25 billion in the next year if any of this compute is actually made available. … Every quarter, Oracle’s debt expands. It paid $1.057 billion in interest in its last quarter, up from $933 million in the one before, and $892 million the quarter before that. In the middle of 2024 (its Q1 FY2025) — just before NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs started shipping — Oracle had $23 billion in PP&E. As of its latest quarter, it had $67.875 billion, likely almost entirely made up of NVIDIA’s GB200 racks, which The Information reported had negative 100% gross margins, specifically on Oracle Cloud. This is not a situation where Oracle “works it out.” GPUs are destroying its gross margins just as its software business begins to contract, and its largest customer for this unprofitable business segment is OpenAI, the company that does not have any money and in fact loses it all. The longer the AI bubble inflates, the more it seems like Oracle is in threat of actually defaulting on its loans and collapsing. This December chart from Manu Invests shows why Oracle is the most vulnerable of the (would-be) hyperscalers: pic.twitter.com/vW8C7nhm9H — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) January 26, 2026 This goes a long way toward explaining the 25% drop in Oracle’s share price over the past six months: pic.twitter.com/4qD57iFm1K — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) January 26, 2026 The financial research and technology platform Trefis tried to explain Oracle’s share-price decline to Forbes readers: Oracle (ORCL)’s stock plummeted by 37% in the last three months, even with a modest increase in revenue and better margins. The reasons for the decline include cautious Q2 earnings, diminished enthusiasm in AI, reductions in analyst price targets, and insider selling—all contributing to a significant drop in investor confidence. What’s truly behind this rollercoaster? … Bears should be warned that financial seer and CNBC talking head Jim Cramer calls Oracle a “linchpin stock” for the AI boom: Jim Cramer: I wanted to be fatuous just in keeping with the news that I read which makes me feel like, are you kidding me? Come on, are you kidding me? Are we really supposed, what are we supposed to sell Oracle off of this? But even Cramer jawboning the stock wasn’t enough to turn the tide. That took some news about Oracle’s 15% share of American TikTok becoming official. Controlling TikTok Bumps Oracle’s Share Price A new internal memo from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew however, has Oracle shares rising in price today. Key highlights: Today, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, enabling our US users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience. … TikTok’s growth in the US nicely sets up the Joint Venture for strong future success. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users. It will be led by Adam Presser who, today, has been chosen by the Joint Venture’s Board of Directors for his impressive track record with the company leading large-scale teams in the areas of Trust & Safety and Operations. The New York Times has more details, including who owns how much of this new beast: Investors including the software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. … Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the chief executive for the U.S. TikTok. The deal is intended to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. … Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance will own just under 20 percent. … The majority of the seven-member board for the new U.S. TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees. Mr. Chew has a seat on the board. The new venture will moderate content in TikTok’s feed, deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down. Note that Oracle’s main partners in the new venture are an Emirati investment firm and Egon Durban’s Silver Lake. The UAE Is All-In on Israel’s Hasbara Agenda Forgive me for a brief detour, but it’s important to point out the political and geo-strategic context in which the UAE is a key shareholder in American TikTok. The UAE is currently isolated in the Middle East after falling out with Saudi Arabia. The latter is building a Sunni block that includes “Qatar, Oman, Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan” while the UAE is openly aligned with Israel and India, per the SCMP. The UAE has been pushing reactionary narratives in the west since the end of the Arab Spring, but now it stands exposed as an open ally of Israel. From The Washington Post last week: …the rupture between the two oil-rich monarchies is already rippling beyond Yemen as Saudi Arabia, alarmed by what it sees as aggressive military and foreign policy moves by its much smaller neighbor, works to counter the deep web of influence Abu Dhabi has spent years building in the Horn of Africa and around the Red Sea. … Riyadh’s sudden, more assertive stance has countries in the region trying to navigate the rift. For years, Saudi Arabia and the UAE worked largely in tandem, backstopping other autocrats amid the Arab Spring uprisings and joining forces to counter the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. In recent days, however, Saudi Arabia has shored up other alliances to curtail its rival and is in talks with both Egypt and Somalia to expand security cooperation between the three countries, according to a senior Somali security official. Somalia’s federal government also said it was canceling its defense agreements with the UAE, which maintains commercial ports and military bases in at least three areas — Somaliland, Puntland and Jubaland — where the government in Mogadishu has little presence or influence. … Andreas Krieg, an associate professor at King’s College London’s School of Security Studies, has described the UAE’s regional network as an “axis of secessionists.” “Abu Dhabi is comfortable operating below the threshold of formal statecraft, building influence through a web of commercial vehicles, logistics access, security assistance, intermediaries and local armed partners,” he said. Notably the WaPo piece avoids any mention of the Israeli-UAE alliance. Dr. Krieg spells it out more clearly on his X account: Saudi has convened an impressive coalition of states with immense depth that includes Turkey (who disagree with the UAE over Somalia, Libya and Sudan), Egypt (who see themselves confronted by UAE statecraft in Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya) and the rest of the GCC, plus Pakistan as a… https://t.co/lTJoQ8Lbxi — Dr Andreas Krieg (@andreas_krieg) January 23, 2026 I should also mention that Silver Lake is a primary owner of Ari Emanuel’s WME Group, the company that owns a majority of TKO, parent company of the UFC and WWE. Emanuel played a key role in the Ellisons’ securing Trump’s approval to buy Paramount, and also reportedly helped the Ellisons secure financial backing from the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth funds for Paramount’s (so far) unsuccessful bid for WBD. I doubt that same constellation of investors could be assembled today, after the falling out between the Saudis and the UAE. But let’s get back to TikTok. Adam Presser’s Fight Against ‘Anti-Semitism” Drawing Attention New CEO Adam Presser has been outspoken about his plans for the platform. Here are some key points from Presser’s talk at last year’s World Jewish Congress (via Chris Menahan on X.com) LONG CUT: Adam Presser, TikTok's new CEO under the Larry Ellison takeover, told the World Jewish Congress last year, • They made "Zionist" a "proxy for a protected attribute" to designate it "hate speech" if used in a negative light (the WJC lobbied for this change). • TikTok… https://t.co/TDnsfVvMqn pic.twitter.com/zkaHy7WLCL — Chris Menahan 🇺🇸 (@infolibnews) January 25, 2026 So far it looks like the new moderators are operating with a heavy hand. Here’s how one American alt-media outlet is faring under the new regime: UPDATE: TIKTOK IS COOKED. Our @tiktok_us videos went from tens of thousands to 0. (seemingly a direct result of Trump & Bibi’s friends taking over) pic.twitter.com/XHMR1oW3Yp — The Tennessee Holler (@TheTNHoller) January 26, 2026 Tough Transition It’s not just heavy-handed moderation that’s troubling TikTok’s first days under new management. The Verge headlined their piece on the platform’s issues “TikTok USA is broken.” Key points: Many in the US have found it impossible to upload videos over the last day or so, which are sitting “under review” indefinitely. One video we uploaded from a US account last night has yet to go live, nearly 12 hours later, while a video uploaded from the UK is published — but it’s only visible to our editors who aren’t in the US. Similarly, accounts for pages like the BBC and The Guardian only show new uploads for those of us who live outside the US, while viewing the same account from the US shows only videos uploaded before Sunday morning. Issues that thousands of people have reported and we’ve been able to confirm include difficulty logging in, the inability to upload or publish videos, a For You Page algorithm that isn’t personalized, problems loading comments, as well as errors flashing for other features, and problems with the CapCut video editor. Given the timing, many drew a link between TikTok’s issues, its US operation’s new Trump-friendly owners, and this weekend’s anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, exacerbated by the killing of a second local resident, Alex Pretti, by federal agents. The combination of publishing errors and previously political For You Pages that are suddenly filled with generic content has led many to assume the worst when their videos about ICE wouldn’t publish, but at the moment, the problems appear to be much more extensive. Previously popular TikTok anti-genocide advocate Guy Christensen has been urging his followers to migrate to a new platform called UpScrolled with the sales pitch that “It’s led by a Palestinian and promises no censorship from billionaires.” I have to assume that TikTok will sort out its technical issues, but as with the Ellisons’ CBS News it is unclear if they will be able to create a controlled platform that retains enough popularity to be influential. It also remains unclear what the impact of the much anticipated AI bust will be on the Ellisons’ plans for global info domination. Related Posts: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Just FYI, Oracle also owns and runs Cerner systems. The EHR company. Second only to EPIC in its use in America. Since I am old enough to have used them all in the past, I can very much assure you that it is the biggest disaster in the field. Colleagues who are still forced to use it now have told me that literally it has caused all kinds of mayhem up unto death in its latest configuration. My feeling is that Oracle bought Cerner about 2-3 years ago or something like that. They immediately got the VA involved in their product, and the VA began to have disasters like it has never had before. Am I the only one bothered by the fact that we have these big leviathan like computer companies like Oracle and Amazon ( most all of them are run on AWS in the background) with their mitts all over everyone’s personal data? I am not sure what would happen to the EHR field if something as big as Cerner goes under – but it sure would be fun to watch. Ellison claims that Oracle’s access to private data is its hole card in the rapidly commodifying AI space. I’ll look into Cerner & Oracle’s acquisition thereof. Thanks! Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner in December 2021 with the formal purchase occurring in June 2022…so around 4 years ago. Purchase price was $28.3B. Cerner was based in Kansas City and had a weird office location policy… basically a few large office towers in radically different parts of the KC metro area. They also bounced employees from one location which was a big source of frustration. Now, most of those old office towers are in desperate need of tenants. I’m not in medicine, but I also have heard that Epic is better than Cerner although that might be a low bar to clear. Not sure if you saw OpenAI’s recent ChatGPT health announcement. I believe Anthropic announced something similar shortly after. It will be pervasive. The new season of The Pitt (emerg show) has a commentary on it. I haven’t had first-hand experiences with Oracle’s offerings as much as IBM’s (another company that’s really good at rotting software it acquires from within like a parasitic wasp). What I am specifically familiar with is that, beyond everything else, Oracle has a definite reputation in the open-source community. I think it’s largely from the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, which was probably as close to a spiritual opposite of Oracle as an American software company could be. Funny enough, IIRC it worked out kind of like Oracle’s recent business moves; tons of developers & engineers quickly jumped ship, and core contributors created independent forks of anything Sun had open-sourced (which was much of their IP because that’s how Sun rolled). And a lot of the customer base just went with them. So I totally believe you that Oracle could turn an EMR system into a dumpster-fire in under 5 years. Sun Solaris used to be a big deal but don’t hear much about it these days. I guess Java and Android are kind of joined at the hip, but not sure what that means for Oracle. I feel like a dupe for not knowing this. I work in public health and several of our partner facilities use cerner – and have been, for nearly 2 years now, borderline nonfunctional and mostly noncompliant vis a vis their reporting requirements to the municipal health department. The reps from cerner proper are overwhelmingly useless, although from my perspective it’s hard to tell if that’s a fundamental problem with the product or just those guys in particular – but we don’t have these issues with anyone using epic or in house solutions. Ed Zitron tweeted that Oracle may sell Cerner to pay for AI data centers. TD Cowen had a data center themed analyst letter today that said that Oracle may lay off 20-30,000 people or sell Cerner to keep up with the debt on the data centers it’s building for OpenAI. It also says multiple US banks have pulled back from Oracle data center deals. I’m starting to think of AI as a modern version of the old Golem mythology. per wiki: In modern popular culture, the word has become generalized, and any crude automaton devised by a sorcerer may be termed a “golem”.[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem Steve Balmer once said the great thing about Windows was that you could keep selling the same piece of intellectual property over and over again. You were selling it while still owning it. Louis B. Mayer said the same about the movie business. So isn’t all this investment in energy sucking data center hardware a violation of the grift that made Bill Gates the titan (/s) he is today? Clearly karma tells us that an Ellison bankruptcy is devoutly to be wished–perhaps at the same time that Trump is impeached and Netanyahu ushered into his Israeli jail cell. The difference is MS was selling something with $0 cogs. All the AI people are trying to to sell stuff with massively negative margins. This is why some of us believe in the jolly roger. Perhaps some people will wise up & learn to limit what personal info they put on these platforms; then again… The Ellisons seem to think Robber Baron = Media Mogul They are not the same, supposed “business acumen” does not translate from “regular” business to Media Empire. Rupert Murdoch chased his White Whale of DirectTV for years, and finally caught it. Then the phone hacking case in the UK threatened to take down the whole empire, but as Harry Shearer lampooned on Le Show almost every week during Trump 1.0, Murdoch (allegedly) had a hotline to the White House. Trump has thrown the Ellisons under the bus, not a good look for aspirational Media Moguls, especially when their primary portfolio is upside down. We’ll see how many billions of dollars being a poodle for Israel is worth. How has Trump thrown them under the bus? throwing shade / cold water on the Skydance/WB merger Variety I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine Trump’s kicked them in the teeth multiple times. There’s this gem from my piece last week: Despite Bari and Donald excitedly kissing one another on the cheek when they met at the site of CBS’ interview with the POTUS, the administration threatened to sue the network (again): Moments after President Trump finished taping a 13-minute interview on Tuesday with the “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil in Michigan, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, approached Mr. Dokoupil and his colleagues to convey a message from the president. “He said, ‘Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,’” Ms. Leavitt said in an even tone, according to a recording of the exchange obtained by The New York Times. “Yeah, we’re doing it, yeah,” Mr. Dokoupil responded. Ms. Leavitt replied: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’” I’m not sure his actions CBS were suing so much as a shakedown. “Sure you can have your merger but I want a cut. I’ll sue you and you’ll settle for this ampunt and then it can go ahead.” If he is threatening it again he is probably deciding he wants another cut. That’s what happens when you give in to bullies. I am an occasional “user” of TikTok, and the double entendre is intentional given its toxic effect on dopamine. This weekend, it was quite interesting after the murder of Alex Pretti as the for you page knew I was interested in the topic. The quality varied. Today, the for you page has been gutted after I finally accepted the new terms and conditions for a U.S. user. It’s unclear if these are handover snafus or an intentional effort at corporate censorship. Well, the Ellison’s can create a hedge. Set up an industrial bank like Ford and General Motors. Given the infinite malleability of the FDIC, Oracle should be able to finagle guarantees for large portions of its fictitious capital. With Ari Emmanual as one of Donnie’s favored bag-men it should be a slam dunk…only a question of price. Oracle has very deep ties with the state it emerged from, they can do any wrong and will be left unmolested. They certainly own the subsidiary of the the TBlair foundation that is the current government in the UK. OT but does anyone here find that firefox has degraded markedly over the last 3/4 months? “Oracle has very deep ties with the state it emerged from, they can do any wrong and will be left unmolested.” The suite of software marketed by Oracle is now so widely used and so inextricably embedded in the business processes of a myriad of corporations, including many large ones, that the company may be considered Too Big To Fail, leading to the possibility that the State will do everything necessary to keep it afloat in case of a bankruptcy-threatening trouble. A friend is interviewing for a company who provide a SaaS platform for customers dependent on Oracle to point their ERP applications at a new “Oracle” server that is really a open-source DB…. :-) Goodbye Big Red! OT but does anyone here find that firefox has degraded markedly over the last 3/4 months? Not overall but Firefox is not loading some images in a posting. Among others, I have had to move to Opera to load some images in a Simplisimus post. I am not seeing any real pattern but I have not been keeping close track. I’ll have to start. Most of the issue is spent explaining how doomed OpenAI is, the way GPU accountancy guarantees the hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google) will be facing massive depreciation write-downs (and possibly even impairments) for the foreseeable future, and outlining various scenarios explaining what may happen if and when OpenAI fails. Here I see a second layer to the recent DRAM price increases. If OpenAI could likewise restrict the supply of GPUs, it’s possible they or datacenters could artificially raise the prices and argue for appreciation of their assets, to keep the whole gaming going for a few months more. Given the accounting games already being placed in the AI space, I can see something like this coming. They could raise prices to who? AI does not seem to be delivering anything worthwhile beyond the platforms who desire free, ad-fertile content, perverts who can manifest their wildest fantasies and (pace another article here), slothful administrators who somehow feel they fully deserve their place in The Shitshow. An informal collective who are notoriously reluctant to stick a hand into their personal pocket. Good stuff, NWT. I also paused to wonder how many are loudly hyping in the press and to investors, while quietly prepping for something different to happen. I’m going under the idea that if Orace’s dodgy finances blow up in their face, that the US government will ride in to bail them out because they are Too Important To Fail and it is all about national security, dontcha know. What should happen is that entire edifice should be broken up and sold off. Yep thats exactly what will happen. We all know the AI bubble is going to pop and leave a giant mess behind, but I doubt any regular readers here will be shocked when the oligarchs end up being bailed out by the working class yet again. Another way to look at OpenAI is that every company cutting deals with it is fully assuming (or 100% recklessly insouciant) as to its imminent bankruptcy. The counter-parties are in a bidding war with one another for control of the OpenAI estate in bankruptcy and trying to hasten it (before they have to fund their own obligations). MS and Oracle each need an AI stack. Once the VC money dries up and AI providers raise prices for profitability, NVidia could resell the GPUs / datacentres to the survivors. OpenAI is worth more dead than alive to every partner it has. It is turning out like Murder on the Orient Express! When OpenAI dies, Microsoft gets everything, they essentially own all of OpenAI’s IP. @Nat Wilson Turner – interesting article, thank you for writing it but, if one small subedit us allowed, the wonderful Omanis are not Sunnis but Ibadis. They are considered apostates by the Sunnis, just like the Shia are, but the Omanis are polite and humble and Oman is cut off by mountains and sea from the rest of Arabia and so they survive like a Switzerland of the Middle East…. Ah, thanks for pointing that out. My ignorance is as deep as my knowledge base is shallow. If I understand this joint venture correctly, Oracle just paid Bytedance a few billion sheckels to do content moderation on the Tiktok platform? There’s no business there, it’s all loss. This is insane. Accenture, Wipro and the other big IT outsourcing services make billions off Bytedance for doing this in the rest of the world. It’s actually setting money on fire to lock down content that all you need is a VPN to see. Good article, thanks! I would like to add that the spike – up 50% – in Oracle’s stock price came the week after its deal with OpenAI where Oracle will deliver compute it doesn’t have, powered with power it doesn’t have, in exchange for money OpenAI doesn’t have. Mr Market is quick to reward playing into bubbles. Something that I started wondering thinking about Oracle’s debt, and the AI bubble in general: Is this a big part of why Trump wants interest rates down, to keep the AI bubble growing? I have mostly seen speculation on it being his background in property or generally inflating the economy. But he is awfully close to the tech billionaires, and they are probably aware of the need for low interests to blow their tech bubbles. Maybe someone has written about this, and I have just missed it. Or maybe there is some solid reason to think this isn’t the case. Regarding interest rates, agreed. A return to ZIRP would be tossing Ellison a lifeline. Are there dots to be connected here? Pretty much every billionaire would benefit from ZIRP, so there’s probably a line. Adding to the TikTok angle: according to Kyle Kulinsky and Kristal Ball, who tested it, now you can’t do a direct message on Tiktok if it contains the word “Epstein”. Being a nerd, I’ve paid some attention to the WB bidding war. It never made sense to me how Warner Brothers is worth … 100 billion? Really? In this case the Ellison’s may be saved from themselves. Excellent article by the way, it convinced me that we’ll be looking at massive bailouts soon. I wonder if they’ll be public. The Fed will likely engineer what many will consider hyper-inflation in order to bailout the big debtors such as private equity, the tech bros, an so on. What else can they do in order to avoid a economic collapse? Free money is the only way the party can continue. When things get really ugly there may well be a smorgasbord of actions taken – bank bail-ins, quantitative easing, ZIRP, massively expand the Fed’s balance sheet, and the outright theft of other nation states assets – gold, various minerals, oil, USD holdings.

Amazon layoffs: Amazon is executing a historic pivot this January 2026. To fuel a $35 billion quarterly AI surge, the tech giant is cutting 14,000 corporate roles. CEO Andy Jassy frames this as a "bureaucracy tax" removal. While Capex jumped 55%, AWS growth has re-accelerated to 20%. Investors are watching closely as Amazon trades management layers for custom AI silicon. This strategy prioritizes long-term efficiency over immediate retail margins.

Title: What "The Best" Looks Like
URL: https://www.kuril.in/blog/what-the-best-looks-like/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T16:04:07Z
Full Content:
Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see. —Arthur Schopenhauer The second that the next round of funding hits the bank, every new CTO starts obsessing over the same thing: Who the hell do I hire next? The answer is surprisingly non-obvious. You’re told that you always want—scratch that, need—the best of the best, your startup’s future depends on it. You’re told your company is unique, special, and it requires the most hardcore among researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers. You never skimp on who builds the golden goose. You can’t succeed with any less than that. But, is that actually true? Every startup-hustle YouTube video, VC podcast and celeb founder interview regurgitates that the key to success is to hire the very best people, no matter what it takes. And yet you live in the real world, with real-world constraints. You have only so much money in the bank. Only so much time and bandwidth to hire. Only so much attention in a given day. And you’re not alone in your hunt. You’re competing with hundreds of other players in your geography, industry, and problem space looking for “the best.” Many of them have a more famous brand, more cash, more promising equity, more charming founders, and maybe even a high production value promo video showcasing happy employees, rare wood office counters and a shoes-off policy. Will you actually hire the best of the best against those odds? Many years ago I found myself in this pickle and I had to learn all the relevant lessons the hard way. I share these lessons here, so that you don’t have to struggle through that same maze yourself. My pain is your gain. My first time around the startup world in 2012, I hardly knew what I was doing and relied mostly on luck—and unfortunately, firing—to end up with a team I could be proud of. I had no real point of reference for greatness, for what “the best” in our area could look like, and building that model required lots of experimentation, with high highs and many low lows. The story of David, our brilliant infrastructure ops engineer at Freckle, has stayed with me ever since. David applied to the company back when we were only hiring for an ops role. We were growing slowly, so there was zero room for anybody who wasn’t absolutely essential on the team. We had no open-ended extra seat for a smart person who just happened to be on the market, unlike some companies these days. David was 100% what we were not looking for. He had never done any ops. In fact, he had never done anything related to web dev or product engineering. I’m not sure he even knew what AWS was at that point. He was a sharp physics guy working with a professor on simulations in an academic context. He didn’t let that deter him. He wanted to work at Freckle, thanks to our reputation as one of the few software startups in the world using Haskell in production at scale. We were an odd outlier in a sea of buggy and laborious Rails apps, a shelter for people who didn’t want yet another web slop gig. And Haskell was oh-so-hot in the Hacker News programming language theory space at the time, a technology attracting software nerds obsessed with correctness and new, better ways of developing bug-free apps. I immediately told David that he was not a fit; he had none of what we were looking for. And yet he persisted, emailing me that he would do whatever test project we threw at him, and if he bombed it, no problem, he would go away. But if he nailed it, we would have proof that he was qualified, in spite of what his CV indicated. Fine. I sent him a meaty cloud ops take-home project, expecting to never hear from him again. Importantly, this was in the days before you could have Claude Code slap that together for you in two prompts. A day or two later, he returned the project to us, and it was pretty much flawless, doing even more than we had asked for. That was not expected. I got curious about what else he could do. We weren’t drowning in applicants anyway, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose. We took him through the usual interview process. He was humble, optimistic, well-spoken, actively communicating and taking feedback well, eager to get to work. He was pumped about everything he could learn on the job, about the doors that would eventually open if he nailed it. He didn’t have much experience, as someone who had never written commercial software before, but he was really quick to absorb everything we threw at him. We gave him a chance. As predicted, he was stellar, and we had a really good run with him until he moved on to a much more illustrious employer. A few years later he became a senior principal engineer at Stripe, going from a physics lab, then a starry-eyed K-12 software startup, to being a big deal at one of Silicon Valley’s finest firms. An unsurprising path for one of “the best.” While building the different companies I worked at, I’ve run several times into “Davids” who ended up with meteoric career trajectories, sometimes already pedigreed in all the right ways, sometimes completely invisible to everyone but the trained eye of a CTO looking for gold. What is special about someone like that? And how can you, with your humble hiring budget, identify them before their value is obvious to everybody else in the market? With David, it was obvious that I had lucked my way into finding him. He had to badger me into seeing what he was capable of, at a time when I was only looking for obvious signs of success. Later on at my game studio, thanks to a brutally skewed job market, I had the total pick of the litter during Hiring Summer and could select one or two stellar engineers from hundreds of perfectly reasonable applicants. There was hardly any competition, with money drying up all around the industry. Again, I found a diamond in the rough. But this time I had the right knowledge and strategies in place to end up with the kind of team I wanted with far less reliance on luck. Even as I was drowning in hundreds of resumes that all started to look the same, “the best” candidate was still in there, like a needle in a haystack. This time, I felt like I was actually skilled enough to find that hidden gem, not simply crossing my fingers and relying on luck alone. That’s a feeling of empowerment I would like you to experience as well. Of course, when every company says they have the best people, the math doesn’t work out. And of course, if they regularly have to fire staff, something doesn’t add up again. One day you end up landing a job at one of these companies and realize that the braggadocio was hardly reflective of reality, but then again, it’s all part of the startup founder LARP that requires you play the part. “Our team is okay, you will probably like working here, we sometimes know what we’re doing” would be a much more accurate depiction, but you’ll never find that quote on the careers page. Regardless, you want to be a good Boy Scout CTO and live up to the lofty expectations set for you by the Silicon Valley elders, and at least try to hire “the best of the best” as they say in all of the fireside chats. But then, a question naturally emerges: what exactly do we mean by the best? The accolades? Pedigrees? Github stars? Hacker News front pages? Job title? Celebrity employers? Number of former YCombinator companies worked at? Hackathon wins? Typing speed? Clout among other Rust developers wearing fuzzy animal costumes? That all sounds good, I guess, but is that all relevant to your company? It turns out that “the best” is mostly subjective and specific to your situation. The culture, the vibe, the industry, the processes of your company, and the technical choices will all influence who will be a phenomenal addition to your tribe. That person might not be the same individual bringing in a million or two a year at Meta. In fact, that highly pedigreed, highly connected individual might be a net negative for your company, even though they might, at least on paper, seem the most high-end among candidates. They may blow the mind of a recruiter at Netflix, but they may not want to schlep through all of the messiness and chaos of an early stage company still trying to define itself. They’re not the best for you, and they’re likely not the best for startups, but plenty of other people are. Your job is to determine what those traits are and where to find people who have them. Your company, timing, industry, problem space and founding team personalities are unique, which is why a generic blog post or a book could never tell you exactly what hires are optimal for you. However, experience shows that there are many universal winning commonalities between great hires that will be applicable regardless of your early stage company’s unique DNA. I identify 11 of them below. The 11 traits: As a side note, I found Patrick Lencioni’s framework from The Ideal Team Player to survive first contact with both pre-seed and Series A+ realities. It’s one of those dry-as-dust HBR book club management self-help guides that get an eyeroll by your median 20-year-old founder going through YCombinator, but in my experience it confirmed and put a simple model around something I had personally seen emerge again and again in the field. Lencioni identifies three essential traits: hunger, humility and smarts, the latter of which should have been called EQ all along. You’ll see them referenced below. The three criteria may seem obvious at a glance, but having a simple framework to work with as you’re making hundreds of decisions makes a big difference. Simple things done right turn out to be pretty darn powerful. Let’s take a closer look at the 11 commonalities among great startup hires I’ve identified. Some of them are simply statistically likely to occur due to the nature of startup hiring. Others are ones you should straight up filter for when you’re doing your search. The best hires in the early stages are usually non-obviously good to the untrained eye. They don’t look as appealing to employers with infinite resources who otherwise would have already hired them. If they were obviously incredible, it would be unlikely you—at your startup—would ever talk to them. One of the most important skills of a startup CTO trying to hire an amazing team is the ability to uncover awesome talent that others have overlooked. These candidates get skipped often due to being too off-the-beaten-path and under-pedigreed compared to the obvious picks that every other company is making. Often these candidates are bad at marketing themselves, don’t know where to look, and are off-putting in some way to the naive search. You have an opportunity to take advantage of that oversight. Realistically, someone who looks like the perfect FAANG candidate who has won all of the math olympiads, had all of the stellar internships, and went to the top CS schools will either: a. get a big cash dump from YC and start their own thing, or b. go work at one of the career-building brand names in the Valley and make a monstrous amount of money. The karmic wheel is just about cycling between those two until that person either gets into VC or becomes an exec at a prestigious firm years later. If that’s what the universe has in store for a candidate, taking a chance on a no-name team with 12 months in the bank, poor development practices and sloppy management is a tough proposition. That leaves a pretty large pool of “everybody else” who didn’t pattern-match. How you go about sifting through them is a big topic I will leave for another chapter, but the key is to look for signals that are less obvious than a Stanford degree and an OpenAI internship. Often that looks like a large volume of work, expertise in unsexy niche areas of technology, an intense work ethic driven by curiosity, and many others. A Stanford CS degree is no guarantee someone will be a phenomenal contributor at your company, but it’s a reasonable proxy of future potential for large employers with long time horizons that allow them to invest in coaching and nurturing their junior staff. That’s not in the cards for a pre-revenue startup that will run out of money next year. The best people for your startup will most likely be senior, or at least mid-stage contributors with several solid years of experience. Too senior isn’t great either, you don’t need the large scale cross-team mature product jousting chops. There’s likely no staff-level work for them to do, and staff-level engineers aren’t just faster-typing seniors. As an early stage startup, until you have enough lead developers, senior product managers, senior designers etc. to set the standard, hiring fresh-out-of-school contributors is a gamble. Junior staff are still developing their taste, judgment, ability to work in a team, and understanding of how to follow the process and when to deviate from it. Without an adult in the room you’re in cat-herding territory. This isn’t to say that you won’t get work done this way, but you could have had someone else in that seat who required less supervision. And you’re at a stage where every seat is mission-critical and the opportunity cost is significant. While it might not matter too much as you throw prototype spaghetti at the wall in the early days, as soon as you have something worth maintaining and complexity rises, you’re now in a race against time. Someone must actively garden the complexity of the work and be ultimately responsible for it, and that someone will tend to be not fresh-out-of-school. Sure, a green dev can care about complexity. But most haven’t yet lived through a soul-crushing, multi-week refactor fueled by years of tech debt, the kind of preventable trauma that earns you “character-building scars.” If they’re learning those lessons on your watch, they’re doing it at the expense of your delivery timeline and your sanity. I’m fond of mid-stage software developers who demonstrate terrific chops, hunger to learn and prove themselves. Yes, they require more hand-holding, but usually the volume of work they put out, and their openness to re-do it, if needed, is worth betting on. You should be able to manage a couple of them yourself as the CTO in the early days, and soon enough you’ll have other senior people on the team who will pick up the mentorship torch. This also means that the “best people” to hire at this stage will tend to be earlier in their careers. The longer great people are on the market, the more likely they are to be identified by the market as being great. Your job as a startup CTO is to find them before others do. Once the market has found them and has actively started rewarding them, they will be out of your price range. Now, it’s worth mentioning that in specific well-capitalized niches of the startup market, companies are now able to pay a decent chunk of change thanks to larger VC rounds and quicker time-to-revenue. Thus, the old school notion that BigCo always pays best may not hold true as often. Here’s a quick sample of many Work at a Startup roles in December 2025. Not quite at FAANG-level, but far from starvation. That also means that, unless your company grows fast or shows tremendous potential for the yet-unvested equity, you won’t get a ton of time with your great early career hires. They will quickly accumulate valuable experience and prove themselves to be stellar, and move on to a prestigious employer with longer time horizons, a great brand name, and a stupendous paycheck that you will not be able to match. Being an L5-7 at BigCo pays a pretty penny, with none of the unpredictability of startup equity and saner hours, but none of the adventure and camaraderie of a pirate ship. For employees later in their careers, that’s not a bad tradeoff. Once they have vested with your company, it makes sense for them to diversify their equities, as they already own one lottery ticket. Being on the receiving end of a reference call for one of your star employees, while they’re still working at your company, is always bittersweet: on one hand you want what’s best for them, to level up and grow in their career. On the other, they’re your discovery—dang it—and you know you won’t be able to counter-offer the type of employer they can now attract. Or they decide to start their own company, emboldened and informed by the experience at yours. In the end, that’s okay. Sometimes a great hire’s growth trajectory is faster than a startup’s, and you can be grateful for having given them a chance to prove themselves and to find a new path that they wouldn’t have otherwise. That kind of hire will have likely made a major difference to your company and having trusted alumni out there in the world doing great things should be a source of pride and good industry karma for any CTO who discovered them. The best hires are self-driven, stoked by the ability to learn, to gain mastery of the craft, and by being able to show off their accomplishments to the rest of the team they want to impress. When you look at their track record, even when it’s not filled with household-name accolades and pedigrees, you will typically see breadcrumbs of exploration, toy projects and experimentation fueled by curiosity. It’s that classic desire to hack things and understand them. You don’t need to ask them to work a little harder, they know this is a big growth spurt for them and they want to take advantage of it. The company is giving them a valuable practice canvas for their skills and they want to make the most of this opportunity, which unfortunately isn’t that common. They love a challenge, they want to prove themselves, they love the work and they are excited by being around others who will push them to be their best. They would have been hacking on something interesting either way, but now you’re actually paying them to do it. They’re curious about how everything works: your company, the startup world, the industry they’re diving into, other disciplines, the tech they’re using. They’re learning, absorbing. Maybe they want to start their own thing one day, or maybe they’re set on using this gig as a ramp to something else they dream about. Maybe they just want the new optionality granted by having your company on their resume. They’re sponges and will gladly take on the challenges you send their way. I remember throwing a big Redux experiment at David in what must have been his first month at work. Again, no web dev experience prior to this. Nobody on the team knew the technology and he, hired as an infrastructure engineer with a background in physics and zero product engineering experience, had something up and running for us within days. He was pumped he got to do something so radically new for the team as one of his first assignments. Ultimately we decided the tech wasn’t a fit for our existing codebase, we scrapped the experiment, and he ran off to the next challenge with no loss of enthusiasm. At Double Dusk we could not figure out why players would regularly de-sync their character positions on the server when using a custom—and wildly complicated, due to needing to replicate Half Life 2-style movement to the smallest detail inside of Unreal Engine—character movement component in combination with our own Unreal Engine networking tweaks, making character movement authoritative on client instances of the game. A big deviation from the defaults. Our newly-hired star engineer, us being his first ever employer, had to dive into the pit of madness. He almost gave up several times before finally identifying all of the spots in the physics sub-stepping logic that was causing the drift across the network. I’m confident I myself would have gone completely bananas trying to debug that one. He was proud of the trust we had put in him, he was eager to learn, he didn’t want to let the team down, and I knew enough about him to make the bet that the challenge would have been just barely within his abilities. Hunger is a massive force-multiplier, and unlike many other traits, it doesn’t seem to be teachable. Failures will instill humility. Rejection will hone your EQ. But you’re either driven to compete, learn and prove yourself, or you’re not. No manager’s pep talk will kickstart that drive in you, at least not sustainably. The hubris has to come from somewhere much deeper. Startups are all about rapid experimentation, trying countless ideas that don’t work, and bootstrapping the skills and processes of the company as it figures out just what exactly people will pay for. Trust-building is critical in any team endeavor, and members who are unable to admit fault, who take up all of the space, and/or who need to be right at all costs will be a real problem as the company matures. The best hires are humble and will happily talk about both their victories and their biggest implosions, about what they learned from their misadventures, about talented past coworkers and how their efforts were part of a team. They rarely claim to have single-handedly carried everything on their backs. As you interview candidates searching for the best, many non-obvious great hires will be bad at behavioral interviews—or interviews in general, for that matter. They didn’t get extensive training on answering questions using the STAR method, didn’t drill stock responses to predictable and tired interview questions. They’re early-ish stage hands-on technology people, not smooth-talking execs jumping from one boardroom to the next. It is your job to fish for key nuggets of insight buried in the rough presentation. After you interview enough people with a similar set of standard questions, you’ll be able to spot the outliers in the bell curve of responses. An underrated aspect of humility in startups is detachment from one’s work. Companies in the process of inventing themselves need to actively cycle through many ideas, most of which will ultimately not stand the test of time. Design for the trash can and kill your darlings are important mindsets in creative work, and they extend far beyond music, film and games. Quantity leads to quality, and a great hire will accept regularly needing to apply a flamethrower to their work and try again with the new learnings from the latest experiment. They will not be precious about it, nor will they feel diminished by needing to try again. The Davids do not keep score; they keep trying and do the work knowing that there’s a good chance it will not go anywhere. That is also highly correlated with their ability to take feedback without taking it personally. They’re not afraid of criticism and quick feedback loops. In fact, they seek disconfirmation sooner rather than later. They have excellent feedback metabolism. Building technology companies is a team sport. Everything you do is with the help of other people, for the benefit of other people. As much as the startup world fetishizes the cracked ninja jedi 10x code-poet, if that person makes others never want to talk to them again, cracked they are not. Someone who is able to work with others’ quirks, understand how they operate and what they respond to, and act in a way that brings the best out of their teammates is worth their weight in gold. Brilliant jerks, as great as they are for producing riveting drama in TV shows, quickly become a net negative in the real world. We’re in the squishy human feeling territory here (aka “soft skills”) and you can’t LeetCode your way into knowing if someone will be an ass. There’s no FizzBuzz for empathy. You have to ask them standard questions, shoot the breeze, interact during the various testing phases of the interview, and outside, and ultimately make a call based on the limited data you have. You will never have all of the evidence, but ultimately you have to make a go or no-go call. Sometimes you get lucky and the candidate discloses a consistent pattern from their past that is obviously disqualifying, but often you don’t. How they interact with you and your team throughout the interview is usually a good data point, and that, of course, goes both ways. Regardless of how you investigate this side of them, it’s non-negotiable, and the best hires you’ll make will all have a high EQ. At the same time, someone highly empathetic, but who hides in a cave and is unable to coordinate their work with the rest of the software orchestra, is not the best. Great team players anticipate others’ questions and concerns, and are proactive about reaching out and communicating both their status and the progress of their work to those around them. They make their work visible instead of requiring constant polling for the team to figure out what exactly is going on with them. Remote environments in particular benefit from strong proactive communicators, as you can’t get away with always knowing what’s going on with everybody due to sitting in the same room for most of the week. One great Loom is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words is still much better than having to pull status out of people. Early stage startups move at a pace that generates tremendous entropy, and someone who’s able to coordinate with the rest of a team in a way that feels natural and effortless will allow the small teams to scale without requiring project management and complex processes meant for lower-performing contributors. Perhaps counterintuitively, I don’t fret too much about competence. To me, that’s a given. If your interview funnel is set up well, with a great take-home project, an onsite, or even a work trial, determining if the person you’re interviewing is competent should emerge naturally. After all, you and your team are technical experts, craftspeople who can look at another craftsperson’s work and quickly judge if it is any good. Yes, AI is getting pretty good these days and it’s becoming easy for candidates of all disciplines to hide behind prompts, but that’s only an extra reason to allow them to bring those tools into the interview itself and showcase their use rather than shamefully hide their existence. How they use the agents, the back-and-forth, the planning, the tweaking, the types of searches they do as part of the exercise are all valuable data points for determining competence, and you should allow candidates to surface them. In-person interviews and work trials are for now non-gameable, so if you’re extra paranoid, they are a great option. Non-obvious candidates will be in the hiring race with fewer other companies, possibly none, depending on your industry. That gives both you and them more flexibility and time to try working together for a few days before making it official. With a sufficiently relevant set of tasks for the work trial, you can rest assured that they’re competent, and learn a lot more about their other traits in the process. The best start-up hires are problem-solvers, not ticket resolvers. They want to understand what the business is trying to accomplish, what challenge is standing in the way of it, and how to make that problem go away. They’re autonomous in the best of ways. They don’t sit around waiting for someone to tell them what to do; they proactively find challenges and opportunities for improvement, iterate on the feedback, and go out of their way to help their teammates. They figure things out, and they do it without needing their hands held. Someone like David didn’t take no for an answer; he assumed there had to be a narrow path through the rejections he kept getting from me, that it was only a matter of his resourcefulness before he found a crack through which to get what he wanted. The communication, coordination and cohesion overheads that emerge with the addition of more and more staff to the roster are probably the toughest parts of scaling any business. A leader’s job is to streamline and remove these emergent dependencies between people and teams as much as possible. Besides keeping the number of hires low, the other powerful lever that a start-up CTO has is to hire people who will be self-sufficient and require little to no support to get their jobs done. They will ask for help when necessary, but they will take pride in figuring things out on their own, checking in with you when the time is right. They will require little supervision overall, and only direction when it comes to their work. If they’re falling behind, being great communicators, they will let the rest of the team know. If they’re early, they’ll gladly pick the next interesting opportunity to be useful. If they’re struggling, their pride in their work will make them double-down and overcome the challenge at all costs. In that case your job is to help them pump the brakes when necessary, or their pace can become unsustainable. A great startup hire doesn’t only think about their respective lane, but cares about the other disciplines around them that their work is impacting. They understand their angle, their priorities, and their expectations. For example: They think about where and how their work will land and anticipate those objections, addressing them in advance. They proactively reach out to those disciplines to avoid yet another coordination chokepoint that will only gobble up time. As more and more skills are compacting into one single individual, we see AI engineers, product engineers, and product managers becoming more technical and moving downstream into programming. This sort of cross-disciplinary mindset buys companies a ton of leverage and ability to iterate faster. Of course, this becomes progressively easier with experience and seniority. But that’s also why startups moving fast benefit from more mature contributors as time goes on. The reduced communication costs multiplied across more and more team members really add up over time. Unless you have very specific technical needs, having a generalist bias in the early days is a great idea. In fact we’re seeing more and more disciplines get compressed into one, with software developers covering UI, UX, PM and engineering, effectively becoming a cross-disciplinary team of one. Even in later stages, half-a-pizza teams powered by AI can move mountains on timelines that felt impossible just a few years ago. Early-stage startups are notoriously chaotic and unpredictable. You might be working on one feature one day, it might get cancelled the next day, and maybe now you’re fielding customer support calls for something you shipped that accidentally blew up. The next day you’re taking a trip to a customer site to chat with potential users. At no point do you know if any of this will make you money, how long until you kill that feature, and how many more of these iterations you’ll do before you either strike gold or the company runs out of money. There are no guarantees in the startup world, except for the fact that your runway will eventually reach zero if you don’t find something worth selling. As a CTO, it is your responsibility to shield your team from the messy everyday financial reality of where your company is headed. At the same time, I prefer to keep as much as possible in the open so that the team knows how much longer the music will play and when it’s time to start refreshing their LinkedIn profiles. I never want anything to be a surprise to the team when I could have been candid about it far in advance. It’s a fine balance between hiding the daily volatility—mostly of the founders’ moods and their confidence in the company making it—and exposing the long-term trends. This type of universe requires people who are okay with fewer guarantees. A startup will never have the time to run comprehensive studies, to build extensive plans, to gain all of the information necessary to make the right decision. Seeking perfection at the cost of an action is generally unacceptable, and you learn much more by failing in a valiant attempt than in delaying a perfect attempt that you might have validated months earlier by just doing the thing. Great hires respect that process and are willing to operate without all of the information, accepting that the team will figure it out as it moves forward, often deviating from the original objective. Deleting existing artifacts or completely pivoting to a new strategy on a dime is the ultimate startup superpower. Anybody who needs well-spelled-out plans and continuity in whatever they’re doing will ultimately struggle in that kind of environment. Hiring is a gamble, but you can tilt the odds in your favor if you stop playing the same game as everyone else. The “best” hire isn’t the person with the most GitHub stars or the flashiest resume; it’s the person who makes your team better by existing within it. It’s the David who breaks down doors and ends up shaping the direction of the company through their relentless contributions. Developing an eye for non-obvious talent is the only way to build a high-leverage team on a startup budget. Yes, it takes more work. It requires you to actually pay attention. It’s one of the hardest feats to pull off in startup team building. It means you must trust your own judgment over a candidate’s credentials. But if you do it right, you don’t just get a “nice” team, you get a team capable of doing the impossible. Now stop reading and go find “the best”. 28 Dec, 2025 | #cto #startups #leadership #management #hiring #recruiting #talent-acquisition #company-building Share: X HN LinkedIn Reddit Subscribe to the newsletter Hard-won lessons on software, startups, and leading teams.

Investing Stocks open Monday, hoping to end a two-week losing streak as fourth-quarter earnings reports return and take center stage. With volatility cooling somewhat, investors can get back to focusing on economic fundamentals and earnings reports. One nagging concern that reemerged last week was private credit funding, which many on Wall Street, including JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, are worried about. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading flat as we get ready to start the new trading week, and despite a strong rebound last Wednesday through Friday, we still ended with our second straight losing week. As the smoke cleared from the Greenland turmoil and no new tariffs were imposed on Europe, investors renewed scrutiny of fourth-quarter earnings, which so far have been solid. With 1/5 of the S&P 500 set to report and hundreds of other stocks also releasing data, plus more economic reports set to hit the tape this week, there could be another batch of volatility-driven swings coming our way to move stocks. The Dow Jones Industrials fell by 0.58% to close at 49,098, while the S&P 500 ended the Friday session flat at 6,915, down just 0.03%. The big loser on Friday was the Russell 2000, which has been the leading index so far this year. It closed down 1.82% at 2,669. Yields were down across almost the entire yield curve, extending a three-day recovery, as the market stabilized following a volatile week driven by trade tensions, potential tariff threats from President Trump regarding Greenland, and global issues, particularly the Japanese bond market turbulence, which saw yields rise on some maturities by almost 30 basis points. The 30-year long bond finished Friday at 4.83%, while the benchmark ten-year note was last seen at 4.23%. Prices across the energy complex rose by almost 3% on Friday, driven primarily by intensified geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as the U.S. has dispatched an “armada” of warships toward Iran, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. In addition, new U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil vessels and reports of production issues in Kazakhstan further added to the upward pressure for the black gold. Brent Crude closed Friday at $65.88, up 2.84%, while West Texas Intermediate ended trading at $61.07, up 2.88%. Natural gas extended its parabolic move, tacking on another 4.56% to close at $5.28. Over the course of last week, it rose by more than 70% as frigid weather sparked demand and heightened concerns about potential production freeze-offs. After another stellar week for precious metals, it continued on Friday, with Gold finishing the day up 0.96% at $4,983. During the week, the analysts at Goldman Sachs lifted their year-end target for Gold to $5,400 from $5,000. Silver was last seen Friday at $103.08, up a whopping 7.31%. Crypto markets saw some severe downward pressure on Friday with major cryptocurrencies dropping as investors shifted toward safe-haven assets like gold amid rising U.S.-NATO tensions, reversing some of the week’s earlier gains. Bitcoin hovered around $89,500 after a 0.4% decline, while Ethereum dropped 2.1% and XRP fell 2.5% in early trading, following a volatile week of “yo-yoing” prices. As of 8 A.M. EST, Bitcoin was trading at $87,710, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,899, down 1.3%. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Investing Amazon (AMZN) social sentiment dropped to negative 0.15 from a 0.12 quarterly average. Amazon plans to cut 14,000-15,000 jobs starting January 28. Amazon capex surged 55% to $35.1B in Q3. Operating income growth was just 0.06% despite 13.4% revenue growth. Amazon’s YTD return of 4.1% lags NVDA’s 27.5% and GOOGL’s 67% despite 95% analyst Buy ratings. Sending You to Google News in 3 © kasinv / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are up 0.5% this week, but retail investor sentiment tells a darker story. The company’s social sentiment score dropped to negative 0.15 on Reddit and X over the past week, a sharp reversal from its neutral-bullish 0.12 average over the prior quarter. Among select tech peers, Amazon stands alone in sustained bearish sentiment while companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoy bullish or neutral enthusiasm from the retail crowd. A viral post on r/wallstreetbets captured the mood, racking up 2,744 upvotes and 406 comments in 24 hours. The post’s title bluntly stated: “Amazon Just announces a new round of Lay-offs. Combined with AI driven lay-offs.” The announcement hit AWS, retail, Prime Video, and HR divisions hardest, with CEO Andy Jassy framing the cuts as cultural changes driven by AI adoption rather than purely financial pressures. The Reddit discussion revealed deep concerns among retail investors. One highly-upvoted comment captured the anxiety: “AI is literally replacing entire departments now, not just individual roles. This is different from past layoff cycles.” Another trader noted, “They’re cutting 30K jobs while spending $35B on AI infrastructure – the math doesn’t add up for workers but makes perfect sense for margins.” A third commenter expressed skepticism about the stock’s prospects: “How is AMZN supposed to run with the Mag 7 when they’re bleeding cash on capex and cutting their workforce? The growth story is broken.” Retail traders are turning skeptical despite solid fundamentals. The concerns are tangible: Amazon’s year-to-date return of 4.1% lags dramatically behind NVDA’s 27.5% one-year gain and GOOGL’s 67% surge. While 95% of Wall Street analysts rate Amazon a Buy with a $295 target price (26% upside), retail sentiment reflects anxiety over margin compression and AI spending. NVIDIA, by contrast, maintains a 55 sentiment score with 93% analyst support, backed by 67% earnings growth and a 53% profit margin that dwarfs Amazon’s 11.1%. For investors watching major tech stocks, Amazon’s isolation in negative sentiment is striking given its Q3 earnings beat and AWS reacceleration to 20% growth.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

UPDATED 11:33 EST / JANUARY 25 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we team up with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s prognostication follows the publication where we grade our 2025 predictions. In this Breaking Analysis, we tap some of the most telling nuggets from ETR’s rich data set and put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025. Most of the predictions below are backed up with data based on proprietary market intelligence from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey (TSIS) and its quarterly macro drill-down data, which surveys more than 1,700 business technology leaders. Each year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and categorize them. Every year the folder gets larger. In the graphic below we show the mix of topic areas. Of course everything is artificial intelligence, but we’ve tried to isolate those that were AI-specific. As always, security is top of mind for forecasters, as you can see with 25% of the inbounds. Our predictions this year span information technology spending, AI return on investment, Nvidia Corp.’s moat, data, large language models, cloud, changes to the software-as-a-service model, security, hardware pricing and the memory shortag, and the impact of AI on jobs. Let’s dive into the detail. The first prediction is: IT budgets rise about 5% in 2026. Since COVID, organizations have dealt with sustained pressure on IT budgets as interest rates rose and uncertainty dominated. Geopolitical tensions, wars, tariffs and related shocks have kept decision-makers cautious. Against that backdrop, ETR’s quarterly macro drill-down shows IT decision makers currently expecting a 4.6% budget increase. The call at 5% is a modest step above the mean, with notable divergence in large enterprises – they remain more conservative at under 4% – while the C-suite and Asia-Pacific respondents are more optimistic. The data is moving in the right direction. The forward spending outlook has improved meaningfully versus earlier surveys, with a notable jump from the first October survey when respondents were asked for the first time about forward spend into January. In the current survey, 74% of respondents indicate they plan to increase spending, the highest level since January 2022. This suggests the optimism is not isolated to a single segment. The large-enterprise caution is a concern, however, but even within the Fortune 500, the trend is improving, rising by more than a percentage point survey-over-survey. The C-suite cut comes in above the mean at 5.2%, reinforcing that senior leadership sentiment is leaning more aggressively toward growth than the broader population. An important nuance is what this metric represents. This is IT budget data – not vendor revenue. It includes staffing and related internal costs and should not be conflated with market forecasts from firms such as IDC and Gartner forecasting vendor revenue growth. Over time, budgets are likely to evolve as the data center buildout expands access to token-based services and as organizations scale up with less headcount. Staffing is one of the largest line items in IT budgets, and AI-driven productivity and automation will influence that mix going forward. The near-term focus, however, is the 2026 budget direction of roughly 5%, reflected in the survey. The second prediction is that 2026 becomes the year enterprises start seeing AI ROI at scale. In prior years, our prediction was that ROI would remain elusive. The data is now moving in a different direction, with signs of a productivity increasing and more evidence that enterprises are beginning to operationalize AI in ways that sustain returns. The ROI story is aligning around two themes: 1) Measurement discipline and 2) Scaling outcomes. Early in the cycle, organizations were spending heavily while a large portion of the market either was not measuring ROI or had not seen any return. In November 2024, combining “not measuring ROI” with “had not seen ROI” put the total near 50%, a concerning gap between investment intensity and financial confidence. That gap is narrowing. The most important shift is that more organizations are measuring ROI. The share that is not measuring dropped from 27% to 18%, and a rise in financial-operations adoption in the ETR data signals that enterprises are putting cost controls and accountability structures around AI spending. Six to eight months ago, FinOps barely surfaced in insights panels and interviews. Now it is showing up constantly, which tracks with a market moving from experimentation to governance and operational rigor. The data also shows incremental improvement in realized ROI bands. The 1% to 10% ROI bucket has fluctuated but has steadily increased since November 2024. That supports the view that organizations are beginning to realize returns and are learning how to align AI initiatives with measurable outcomes. A key nuance is what enterprises expect ROI to be. In the ETR AI series data, 66% of respondents say AI ROI comes from cost efficiency and margin improvement. Only 23% expect ROI to come from revenue growth or new product creation. That distribution is relevant because it explains why FinOps is rising and why measurement is becoming central. If most ROI is expected to come from margin and efficiency, auditing and control of usage and spend becomes a prerequisite for declaring success. The third prediction comes out of research published earlier this month following Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES. The call is that Nvidia widens its lead over the broader graphics processing unit/tensor processing unit/application-specific integrated circuit pack because its cost per token advantage improves materially in 2026. A key factor is Nvidia’s CES disclosure that its latest GPU Vera Rubin is in full production and will ramp this year. The data shared at CES pointed to a rapid step-function improvement over Blackwell delivered in roughly 12 months: 5X performance, 10X throughput, and a 10X improvement in token cost. That combination of higher output and far lower unit costs is expected to drive a significant uptake in demand. The demand premise is based on Jevons Paradox – as price declines, consumption rises – and the prediction is that the cost-per-token reduction contributes to a 15X increase in demand. Against that backdrop, we expect the narrative that TPUs and ASICs are eroding Nvidia’s moat will itself erode, and the expectation is that Nvidia’s financial metrics will will reflect the magnitude of this advantage. Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio is hovering in the mid-20s – even lower than Walmart – and that multiple increases as investors internalize the sustainability of Nvidia’s position. It’s possible and even likely that some GPU designers will pivot to edge use cases or cancel programs. Looking ahead, our expectation is that Nvidia faces effectively no competition in the data center except where demand cannot be met. That unmet demand supports alternatives, but the path for competitors goes through inference and workloads at the edge. Our view is that Nvidia also performs well at the edge, with the addition of a lock-up a deal with Groq. Demand continues to outstrip supply, which means suppliers broadly sell what they can ship. The implication is that the best news for competitors is the current “rising tide” environment lifts all chip boats, and suppliers have little incentive to see that dynamic change soon. We believe data gravity increasingly benefits database platform incumbents as enterprises build AI capabilities on top of their existing ecosystems. Using Snowflake Inc. as an example, the data suggests that add-on services to a core data platform – like Cortex – become a natural extension of the underlying database. The core platform remains sticky, and that stickiness increases as customers pull adjacent workloads into the same ecosystem. This dynamic applies to other major incumbents, including Databricks Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp, but the trend is more pronounced with Snowflake customers. This chart above has two parts that reinforce the prediction. Specifically, when teams build AI applications, they tend to stay close to the database ecosystem where their data already lives – and that shows up in spending intentions. Starting on the right-hand graphic: This comes from ETR’s build-versus-buy AI series and looks only at respondents who say they are building their own AI applications. The y-axis is Paired Usage Likelihood Impact, which is a way of showing how strongly two components show up together in the same tech stack. Using Snowflake as the clearest example in this cut, the chart shows that when customers adopt Snowflake Cortex Search, they are far more likely to adopt additional Snowflake components. Specifically: In our view, this is the data gravity effect in practice. Once a customer is anchored in a Snowflake-led workflow for one element of the AI stack, the probability increases that adjacent elements – search, vector search or vector database style capabilities, and model-related components – remain inside the same ecosystem. Now move to the left-hand graphic: This is from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey and shows Snowflake Net Score (spending momentum) trends over time across three categories that relate to this prediction: Each cluster shows snapshots over five time points spanning from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. The chart headline says it all: “Gains in Database and Analytics drives aggregate Snowflake recovery.” The data suggests a meaningful rebound in Snowflake’s core database and analytics momentum showing up in 2026, with Database/Data Warehousing notably jumping back up versus the prior quarters, and Analytics showing a similar recovery pattern. ML/AI remains elevated but comparatively steadier across the period. The bottom line is that we see a pull toward the incumbent’s database ecosystem when organizations are building their own AI applications. Snowflake is the clearest example in this dataset. When customers are using Snowflake for one layer of their stack, they are more likely to stay in the Snowflake ecosystem for adjacent capabilities including search, vector search, vector database and foundational model usage combined with other stack elements. This in our view highlights the predictive value of the ETR dataset as a leading indicator. In prior market shifts, Breaking Analysis observed survey data that flagged early movement, including the work-from-home wave and its impact on vendors such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Okta Inc. and Zscaler Inc. We have seen similar leading signals in the rise of Snowflake and Databricks, periods of softening that preceded market repricing and subsequent rebounds. The data suggests the current resurgence is part of that same pattern of early signal preceding broader market recognition. The message is that platform incumbency is compounding in the sense that as enterprises build AI applications, they consolidate more of the stack around the database ecosystem they already trust, and the data suggests Snowflake is currently the clearest beneficiary of that gravity with a measurable resurgence in spending intent. We believe 2026 is the inflection year where leading model providers optimize around enterprise adoption, not just model benchmarks and consumer buzz. Our bet is that OpenAI follows Anthropic’s enterprise posture more aggressively, uses consumer scale as leverage, and exits 2026 with enterprise revenue that surpasses Anthropic’s. In parallel, we expect OpenAI to pressure Google’s search economics, and we expect Elon Musk’s Grok to pursue edge-oriented opportunities where he already has a strategic footprint. The chart above shows where model and AI platforms sit inside enterprise accounts today, using two dimensions from ETR’s TSIS. First, read the plots. Each dot is a vendor. The x-axis is Overlap %, which we use here as a proxy for pervasion and account penetration across the dataset. The y-axis is Shared Net Score, which represents spending momentum among the accounts where the vendor is present. The red dotted line at 40% is the “highly elevated momentum” threshold. The upper-right corner is the power position indicating high penetration and high momentum. That is where Microsoft and OpenAI Group PBC sit in the January 2026 survey and have for some time. Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC are clustered close together in the upper-middle portion, reflecting strong momentum and meaningful overlap. Databricks and Snowflake sit near one another as well, which fits our prior prediction on data gravity and platform pull-through. Anthropic PBC is high on the y-axis with strong momentum, sitting above the red line with notable progress since last year. Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama is well below the threshold and has fallen out of the leadership conversation in this dataset (and the market) relative to the leaders. In the lower-left are the legacy machine learning and AI players fighting for relevance on both overlap and momentum. Second, use the table on the right to anchor the scatter with exact numbers. For JAN26 Shared Net Score and Shared N, Anthropic leads at 72.5% (345), followed by Microsoft at 65.5% (795) and OpenAI at 60.7% (677). Databricks comes in at 58.8% (250). AWS and Google are tied at 58.0% with Shared N of 450 and 483, respectively. Snowflake is at 47.5% (265) and Meta Llama at 29.9% (137). Pervasion on the x-axis is the leading indicator to watch as this shifts from experimentation to enterprise standardization. OpenAI is already near 40% pervasion versus Anthropic at roughly 20%, while most other players remain in single digits. Anthropic doubled pervasion from about 10% to 20% in a year, but OpenAI’s starting position is meaningfully more entrenched inside enterprise environments. That penetration advantage is relevant to our prediction because we believe it makes the consumer volume a feature for enterprise, not a bug. OpenAI’s distribution, usage patterns and familiar interface create gravity that increasingly supports enterprise use cases and API-driven deployments. Recent data suggests that OpenAI’s API added more than $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate last month alone, which reflects enterprise-driven revenue generation and evidence the platform is moving beyond a consumer chatbot phase. In our view, once that enterprise flywheel starts spinning, it continues to gain momentum. On Google, our prediction extends beyond model performance, where Gemini has made truly impressive strides. We believe OpenAI’s recent moves around advertising are aimed at pressuring Google’s core economics. Search queries cost fractions of pennies, AI queries are far more expensive (100X), and we expect OpenAI to keep testing ways to insert itself and disrupt Google’s advertising economics. Though Microsoft’s earlier attempts to AI-ify Bing did not deliver the intended results, we believe OpenAI’s scale and positioning give it a better chance. On Grok, we expect a push to the edge. Elon had explored designing a data center GPU, then backed away from that path as Nvidia’s lead became more obvious. At the same time, Tesla Inc. already operates with an edge-oriented chip design capability built around Arm and customized neural processing units, or NPUs, for vehicles. We believe Grok strengthens that position, with continued silicon innovation focused at the edge while xAI Holdings Corp. scales data center capacity rapidly in Memphis – with a high priority position in Nvidia’s allocation queue. Longer-term, theCUBE Research work by George Gilbert and David Floyer suggests that leading LLM companies could evolve into a new breed of software delivered through application programming interfaces, making adoption easier for enterprises without deep engineering chops. We do not expect that full transformation to be obvious in 2026, but we believe it ties directly to the multiyear shift from legacy IT spend toward token generation and more AI-ified operating models. The message is that enterprise penetration and spending momentum are converging around a small set of leaders, and the data suggests OpenAI has the distribution advantage to translate consumer scale into enterprise-standard deployments, with Anthropic setting the pace on momentum, and Google and AWS clustered tightly – Google having the advantage in proprietary models — and Grok positioning for edge-driven differentiation over time. We believe Google Cloud Platform continues closing the gap on AWS and Azure in 2026, driven primarily by its prowess in AI, reinforced by a world-class data foundation, and supported by improving profitability. As shown below, while GCP still trails in enterprise penetration, the leading indicators in spending intent suggest momentum is shifting in Google’s favor, particularly inside large enterprises. Google Cloud Platform is showing sustained momentum. The starting point is growth and operating leverage. By our estimates, GCP grew roughly 40% last quarter. Alphabet discloses Google Cloud overall rather than GCP specifically, but we believe GCP is growing meaningfully faster than the consolidated cloud segment. At the same time, Google Cloud operating margins have moved into the black and are now in the mid-20s, and moving in a direction we see as increasingly encouraging for a scaled cloud business. In our opinion, those margins continue to expand as the business matures, and that translates into meaningful cash generation over time. The ETR data above reinforces the momentum. In the core spending intent datasets, GCP is the only one of the Big Three cloud providers showing year-over-year Net Score acceleration, while AWS and Azure both declined. Penetration remains lower – pervasion trails those two, particularly versus Azure – but the direction of spend intent is moving up. The spending intent improvements are not confined to smaller accounts. The increase shows up in Fortune 100, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 cohorts, which historically have been harder for Google to penetrate. We believe that shift reflects Google’s broader enterprise prowess – more credibility with the largest organizations and more proof points that GCP can run mission-critical workloads at scale. ETR’s AI series data provides more evidence to explain why this is happening now. We see rising usage across Google’s AI build stack, including Gemini and Vertex AI, with gains survey over survey. In our view, Google’s positioning as both a foundational model provider and a cloud hosting platform is becoming more integrated, and that integration is beginning to show up in customer behavior. We also believe Google’s approach has benefited from patience. The company has the capital to play a longer game. As operating margins climb toward the levels sustained by AWS over many quarters – and as Azure continues to benefit from software contribution – we expect Google to keep expanding profitability while it builds share. That is the combination that changes perception with accelerating demand plus improving margins. The message is that Google’s cloud business is entering a new phase where AI-led demand, improving enterprise traction and expanding operating margins work together, and the survey data suggests GCP is the only Big Three provider accelerating on Net Score while extending its relevance with the largest global organizations. We believe 2026 marks a transition year for software-as-a-service monetization. Seat-based pricing has been misaligned with customer value for a long time, and AI amplifies that tension by changing how work gets done and how many users need direct licenses. At the same time, SaaS vendors have deep entrenchment in enterprise process logic and trusted data, and in our view that gives them leverage to preserve and grow revenue even as seat growth moderates. The prediction is not a SaaS collapse. The prediction is that pricing evolves, with a shift toward outcome-based and AI-inclusive monetization showing up in the numbers. The graphic above is a two-parter designed to answer the question “Does AI reduce SaaS seats, and if it does, does revenue fall with it?” The top row focuses on seats. The bottom row focuses on spend offsets. Start with the top-left table: “AI Impact on Core Software Seats – NOV25 AI Product Series.” It breaks results by customer type and shows the percentage expecting more seats versus same seats versus less seats, then summarizes the net “seat offset.” The seat offset is positive for small and medium-sized businesses (+12%) and modestly positive for the total sample (+4%). It turns negative as you move upmarket to the Global 2000 (-1%), Large (-2%) and Fortune 500 (-8%). The message is that the biggest organizations are the ones most likely to see seat pressure. Now look to the top-right table: “Seat Offset Over Time.” It shows how that seat offset is trending from NOV24 to MAY25 to NOV25. The direction is consistent in that net seat impact is moving down over time, especially in larger cohorts. Global 2000 moves from +11% to +5% to -1%, and Large moves from +17% to +7% to -2%. Fortune 500 shifts from +6% to 0% to -8%. Seat growth is moderating, and in large enterprises it is flipping negative. Now move to the bottom-left table: “AI Spend Offset for Reductions in Seat Spending – NOV25 AI Product Series.” This is the follow-up question asking even if seats decline, does AI-related spend compensate? Respondents are asked whether AI spend will exceed, match, or fall short of any reduction in seat spend. In the Global 2000 row, 51% say AI spend exceeds the seat reduction, 33% say it matches, and 15% say it falls short. That pattern indicates monetization moving from seats toward AI and outcomes. Finally, bolster the conclusion with the bottom-right table: “AI Spend Net Impact Over Time.” This compresses the prior view into a single net impact metric over time. In NOV25, SMB shows 38%, Global 2000 shows 36%, and All Respondents shows 30%. Fortune 500 and Large are lower at 27% and 25% respectively, but still positive. Even in cohorts where seat offsets are negative, the net spend impact remains meaningfully positive. This is why we believe the market’s “SaaS is dead” and the “SaaS-Attack” narrative is overstated. Seat counts can be pressured while revenue grows if vendors successfully reprice around AI, usage and outcomes. We also believe the public commentary from large SaaS vendors aligns with this dynamic. Specifically, customers are asking for help operationalizing AI, and vendors are embedding AI into the products where data, metadata and business process logic already live. The message is that AI creates real headwinds for SaaS seat expansion, especially in the largest enterprises, but the spend data suggests SaaS vendors preserve and grow revenue by shifting monetization toward AI, usage and outcomes – a pricing evolution, not a SaaS collapse. We believe 2026 produces a new class of breach that most security teams are not prepared to contain — specifically, a major SaaS incident where no human credentials are stolen. Additionally, the attack vector is agentic, coordinated across multiple SaaS platforms, and executed by multiple AI agents from different vendors. The novelty is a logic hack, not a credential hack, set off by a prompt injection or agent-to-agent manipulation that redirects an agent’s behavior, spreads laterally via trusted integrations, and moves at machine speed across the digital supply chain. This prediction builds on a related warning from one of our inbounds that came from Shahar Man, CEO and co- founder of Backslash Security. In November 2025, he predicted, “A major MCP breach will define the AI coding threat model – We’ll see in 2026, the first large- scale breach originating from MCP.” What we saw with the Anthropic hack was related and supported the direction of Shahar’s prediction. We’re building on that prediction and expecting something broader. The breach we are forecasting involves one agent reprogramming another through prompt injection, then using MCP connections across SaaS platforms to jump domains – finance, HR, supply chain – potentially spanning multiple vendors and even multiple companies. In our view, agents become bridgeheads meaning once a nonhuman identity is granted access and can influence adjacent agents, the blast radius expands quickly. Some are referring to this as a polyagent breach, where the infection doesn’t just stay in one system. The security implication is disconcerting. Antivirus is blind to this class of attack because there is no traditional malware signature. Firewalls do not help because the agents are executing authorized actions within permitted domains. Phishing campaigns often take weeks or months to coordinate with humans. An agent-driven breach can propagate at machine speed, chaining together permissions and actions faster than human response loops can keep up. To defend this, organizations will need to put in things such as AI honeypot tokens to lure the bad agents, semantics that scan every agentic conversation, and much more sophisticated defense systems that most organizations won’t have in place in 2026. A credible path is identity-first controls and agent governance. Nonhuman identities require zero-trust security, full stop. They must be governed, continuously monitored and treated as untrusted by default. The risk is structural in that if one agent has access that was legitimately granted, and it can influence another agent, the effective access boundary expands beyond what the organization intended. The market is already signaling urgency. Within the CISO community, agentic AI governance, protection and security is again a top topic. Qualitative trend data suggests that identity-centric and zero-trust principles are among the top priorities, and the mandate is moving from theory to budget and operations. The vendor landscape is also shifting toward identity-centric consolidation and platform plays. The Palo Alto Networks Inc.-CyberArk Software Ltd. acquisition is a clear example of this direction. The practitioner requirement is for improved visibility, better decisioning based on data, and the ability to leverage identity intelligence as a defense mechanism. Security operations teams are already adopting agentic AI for triaging alerts and initial investigations, but the identity side is where the value becomes critical because identity is where the permissions live. This relates with a broader dynamic we track every year – tool sprawl and consolidation intent versus consolidation reality. Practitioners consistently express interest in reducing tool counts, but the data shows limited actual consolidation so far. That creates exposure. Platform vendors argue they are seeing consolidation power their business. Practitioners largely agree consolidation is desirable and also acknowledge it is not happening fast enough to reduce risk materially. The message here is that agentic systems expand the attack surface into a new domain where credentials are not stolen and malware is not planted, rather agent behavior is redirected. In our view, 2026 is the year this becomes visible in a major SaaS breach, and the organizations that are not operating identity-first, zero-trust governance for nonhuman identities are exposed to a class of risk that moves faster than their current defenses and operating models can respond. We believe hardware pricing remains elevated through 2026 and persists into 2027, driven by an ongoing memory shortage and a supply chain that is being reoriented around data center demand. High-bandwidth memory, NAND and RAM are in tight supply as data centers absorb capacity, and we expect that dynamic to keep pressure on pricing well beyond a normal cycle. In our view, this becomes a competitive differentiator for suppliers and OEMs that can secure allocation wins. Notably, buyers face a tougher refresh environment in 2026. The chart above captures two things: 1) How respondents say hardware prices have moved recently; and 2) How that pricing trend has shifted over time. Start with the distribution in the center. Respondents are asked: To what extent have vendors lowered or raised prices in the past six months compared to seven to twelve months ago? The responses are concentrated on the “raised” side. A meaningful portion of the sample reports increases in the mid-single digits and above, with a large block indicating raised by 3% to 5% as the most common outcome, followed by raised by 6% to 10% and additional cohorts seeing even larger jumps. At the high end, roughly 25% of respondents say prices rose 6% to 20% or more, which is a significant inflation indicator for hardware buyers. Now anchor that with the time series on the right. The average change in hardware pricing bottomed in late 2024 at roughly 2% to 2.5%. Since then, the average has risen by about a full percentage point, reaching 3.6% in the latest survey. The implication is that hardware price inflation is not fading as a temporary post-pandemic trend. It is re-accelerating at a time when many organizations would normally be entering a refresh cycle. We believe the supply-demand imbalance drives the continued trend, driven by AI factory demand. Vendors benefit from the current dynamic and have little incentive to rush pricing back down. Data center demand is being prioritized, and memory constraints ripple into everything from servers to storage to enterprise infrastructure to PCs. In our view, that is why terms like “AI-optimized” become mainstream marketing language, especially in PCs – memory becomes the gating factor, and vendors position optimization as product differentiation while supply remains constrained. We also believe this has second-order effects across the enterprise stack. Hardware refresh cycles influence demand for adjacent categories that ride on those refreshes, including security appliances and networking infrastructure. As pricing pressure persists, refresh timing and configuration decisions will become more constrained, with related impacts for vendors across the infrastructure and security landscape. Finally, we expect supply chain execution to be a competitive differentiator. Nvidia is likely to remain prioritized in the data center supply chain. On the PC side, it becomes a knife fight where scale and supply chain strength matter. Apple has scale. Dell is moving aggressively into consumer PCs and has a world-class supply chain. Storage vendors are already leaning into efficiency messaging, (for example, Vast Data Inc.’s flash efficiency messaging) and we expect more of that as the market stays constrained. The message is that the hardware market is entering a prolonged period where memory-driven constraints keep prices higher for longer, supply chain access becomes a competitive weapon, and buyers face a more expensive refresh cycle that reverberates across infrastructure categories well into 2027. We believe 2026 is the crossover year when AI’s impact on white-collar employment becomes visible in a way that is measurable and broadly acknowledged. The early impact is already seen in junior and entry-level roles, and this shows up in the data, first as headcount avoidance and then scaling without labor. In parallel, we expect sustained growth in blue-collar roles tied to the data center buildout – specialized trades and technical operators such as “artisan” plumbers, HVAC engineers, builders and cooling experts – where demand is already high and rising. The ETR survey data is already moving in the direction of this prediction. In July 2025, 21% of respondents said they were limiting future headcount due to AI. That figure has increased to 30% in the latest read. This trend is more pronounced in larger firms, which we see as the leading indicator. Among Global 2000 organizations, the number rises to 34%. Among Fortune 100 companies, 42% say they plan to limit future headcount because of AI. The message is that the larger the organization, the more aggressive the posture on future headcount constraints tied directly to AI. We are also seeing movement from avoidance to reduction. Strategic headcount reduction attributed to AI is rising more slowly than avoidance, but the increase from 14% to 18% in roughly half a year is material. These are not marginal shifts, and they are not based on a small or anecdotal sample. The survey represents roughly 1,800 qualified IT experts and IT decision-makers across industries, which makes the directional signal difficult to dismiss. We believe this sits inside a larger pattern that plays out in major technology transitions. Over successive waves – mainframes to PCs, then the internet, cloud, mobile, social and big data – markets tend to reward the new before the new is large enough to offset the decline in the old. That mismatch creates volatility and shifting narratives. We see it today in sector rotation and sentiment – semiconductors in favor, SaaS out of favor – and we expect those narratives to continue shifting. The sensible approach is to focus on the data, filter out headline noise and track the adoption signals that show up in spending behavior and operating model changes. In our opinion, AI is larger than prior waves because it stands on the shoulders of them all. It changes the unit economics of work, and that shows up first in constrained hiring and then in reductions as organizations learn where automation is durable. Over time, we expect labor demand to rebalance, with new job creation tied to physical infrastructure and AI-enabled industries, but 2026 is positioned to be the year where the labor displacement data becomes hard to ignore. The message is that 2026 becomes the year AI’s labor impact is visible in enterprise headcount decisions at scale, led by hiring constraints in the largest organizations and followed by rising reductions, while demand for specialized blue-collar roles expands alongside the data center buildout and the broader AI infrastructure wave. We’re beyond the first inning of this AI era, which started really in 2017 with research papers on diffusion models and transformers. The ChatGPT moment exposed AI’s potential to the masses and now we’re entering the enterprise adoption phase, which we see as the real opportunity. How you see 2026 shaping up?

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Fundraising Capital One just announced it’s acquiring Brex for $5.15 billion. An incredible, top 0.1% “exit” in less than 10 years from a category creator that created massive wealth and opportunities. A huge win. But also … less than half of Brex’s $12.3 billion valuation from October 2022. Should anyone care? Many are seeing is a failure vs Ramp, a measured success at best. But … why? I don’t think most people commenting on this actually understand what they’re reacting to. What they’re really feeling—even if they can’t articulate it—is the consequences of hubristic fundraising. And we should probably talk about it. Because hubristic fundraising is back. In a big way. It was back big time in 2025 and is back even bigger time in 2026. Let me define it simply: Hubristic fundraising is when you raise at a valuation so aggressive, with terms so favorable, with a narrative so bold, that you are essentially betting the entire future of your company on hitting an extraordinary outcome. It’s not just “raising a lot of money.” Plenty of companies raise hundreds of millions without hubris. Hubristic fundraising is when you: These deals can work out. It will work out for Databricks, Anthropic, etc. But at least as of when I write this, there are so very few $30B+ IPOs or exits. And that’s what Brex was promising. ElevenLabs, Harvey, Replit/Lovable, Cursor etc. are promising even more. Brex checked all these boxes. In 2021 and 2022, they raised at valuations that implied they would not just win corporate cards and expense management—they would dominate financial services for startups, then enterprises, then… everyone, apparently. Stupidest behavior I've seen on @brexHQ getting acquired by @CapitalOne for $5.15B: – Saying Brex "lost"– Mocking Brex for the outcome– Claiming investors lost money If losing means starting a business that gets sold for over $5B in 9 years, where both founders make hundreds… — JC Bahr-de Stefano (@jbahrdestefano) January 23, 2026 Let’s remember what 2021 looked like. Zero interest rates. SPACs everywhere. Tiger Global doing deals in 48 hours. Multiples that would make a 1999 VC blush. Brex raised $300 million at a $12.3 billion valuation in October 2022—technically 2022, but really the tail end of the 2021 madness before rates spiked and everything crashed. At that valuation, with maybe $200-250M in revenue at the time, Brex was being valued at 50x+ revenue. For a low gross margin corporate card and expense management company. In a market with Ramp, Mercury, Airbase, Navan, and others all competing furiously. Was that valuation justified by fundamentals? No. Was it justified by the fundraising environment and competitive dynamics of the moment? Absolutely. And that’s the trap of hubristic fundraising. In the moment, it feels not just rational but necessary. Hubristic fundraising works. At least for a while. And sometimes forever. When you’re the $12 billion company and your competitor is the $3 billion company, who do the Stanford MBAs and Google PMs want to join? The big number wins. The paper gains look better. The press coverage is better. The LinkedIn flex is better. Brex recruited absolute killers in 2021-2022. Engineers from Stripe. Execs from everywhere. One of the best sales teams ever under Sam Blond. That was partly product and vision—but it was also the massive valuation signaling “this is the winner.” This one is circular but real. Raise at a huge valuation, and suddenly more investors want in. FOMO is the most powerful force in venture capital. The $12.3B valuation wasn’t a barrier to raising more—it was a magnet for investors who wanted to be part of “the next big thing.” Enterprise customers want to work with winners. When Brex was valued at $12B and their competitor was valued at $2B, which one do more conservative customers feel comfortable signing a multi-year deal with? The big number creates legitimacy. It signals staying power. Every funding round becomes news. Every executive hire becomes news. You’re always in the conversation. That awareness compounds. When you’re raising at $12B and your competitor just raised at $1.5B, you are sending a message: we are going to outspend you on everything. Sales. Marketing. R&D. Acquisitions. Some competitors will give up. Others will make mistakes trying to keep up. Ramp didn’t give up. But many others did. Now for the dark side. This is the big one. And it’s what I think people are actually reacting to with Brex without realizing it. When you raise at a hubristic valuation, you attract employees, investors, and partners who are there for the outcome, not the mission. They’re there because they did the math on their equity and saw an IPO at $25B+ and early retirement. That’s fine when everything is going up and to the right. But the moment you hit turbulence—and every company hits turbulence—those mercenaries disappear. They have no patience for struggle. They didn’t sign up for hard mode. They signed up for paper gains. Brex went through brutal layoffs in 2024. Lost 20% of the company. Massive executive turnover. Struggled with burn. Had to do a full “Brex 3.0” turnaround that CEO Pedro Franceschi admirably pulled off. But where were the fans during that turnaround? Where were all the people celebrating Brex’s dominance in 2021? Gone. Because they were never fans. They were mercenaries betting on an outcome, not a company. Brex just sold for $5.15 billion. In cash and stock. To a major bank. Creating liquidity for everyone. Is that a failure? We’re already seeing this play out in real-time in AI. Look at Windsurf. Windsurf (formerly Codeium) was one of the hottest AI coding startups. They had $82 million in ARR with enterprise revenue doubling quarterly. OpenAI offered $3 billion to acquire them. When that deal fell apart, Google paid $2.4 billion in a reverse acqui-hire for the CEO, co-founder, and 40 senior staff. Cognition then scooped up the remaining assets—the product, IP, 210 employees, and the entire $82M ARR business—for a reported $250 million. Total value captured: roughly $2.65 billion. And yet? The narrative in Silicon Valley was that Windsurf “sold too cheap.” SaaStr literally published “Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap?” The deal was framed as a cautionary tale, a fire sale, a disappointment. Think about that. A company with $82 million ARR that didn’t exist three years ago returned $2.65 billion to stakeholders. In any other era, that’s a legendary outcome. But when Cursor is valued at $29.3 billion? When Lovable hits $6.6 billion with $200 million ARR? Suddenly $2.65 billion for $82 million ARR feels like leaving money on the table. That’s hubristic fundraising distorting reality. The benchmarks have become so warped that even massive wins feel like losses. For Ribbit Capital, who led the Series A, this is a monster return. For employees who joined early, this is life-changing money. For the customers using the product, nothing changes except they get the backing of a major financial institution. But because the peak valuation was $12.3B, the narrative is “Brex failed.” They got acquired at a “steep discount.” They “crashed.” This is insane. A $5B+ exit is an incredible outcome for any company. But hubristic fundraising creates hubristic expectations. And anything short of those expectations feels like failure—even when it objectively isn’t. When you’ve raised at $12B, you can’t think about $5B exits. You can’t consider acqui-hires or smaller strategic deals. Every decision has to be oriented around justifying that massive valuation. This leads to over-expansion, over-hiring, and over-spending. Brex’s $17 million/month burn in Q4 2023 was a direct consequence of trying to grow into a $12B valuation. For Brex to have “succeeded” by the mercenary definition, they probably needed to IPO at $20B+ or get acquired for $15B+. In the fintech market of 2023-2025. With rising rates. With competitors like Ramp breathing down their neck. That’s an almost impossible bar. And when you don’t clear it, everyone who joined for the outcome—and only the outcome—writes you off. Here’s the thing that should concern everyone: we’re doing this again. And in the Age of AI, we’re doing it at a scale that makes 2021 look quaint. Look at Ramp. In 2025 alone, they went from $13B to $16B to $22.5B to $32B. Four funding rounds in one year. Nearly tripling their valuation in twelve months. Is Ramp a great company? Of course. They hit $1B+ in ARR in record time. They’re cash flow positive. They’ve executed brilliantly. But four rounds in one year? A $32B valuation for an expense management company? This is 2021 fundraising playbook all over again. Except now, in AI, it’s 2021 on steroids. Let me share some numbers that should make your head spin. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion in a seed round. Not Series A. Not Series B. A seed round. At a $12 billion valuation. Before shipping a product. The former OpenAI CTO walks out the door and six months later has a company valued higher than Brex just sold for. And it gets crazier. Bloomberg reported Thinking Machines is now in discussions to raise additional funding at a $50 billion valuation. Even with their CTO having just quit with several other top team members to go back to OpenAI. That would be a 4x markup in less than a year. For a company that just launched its first product in October. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised over $1 billion for his AI safety startup. The former OpenAI Chief Scientist hasn’t shipped anything public yet. But billions? Sure, here you go. Harvey, the legal AI company, went from $3B to $5B to $8B across three funding rounds in 2025 alone. They raised $760 million in a single year. They 2.7x’d their valuation in ten months. For an AI tool that helps lawyers do due diligence faster. ElevenLabs went from $1.1B (January 2024) to $3.3B (January 2025) to $6.6B (September 2025). That’s 6x in less than two years. A voice synthesis company is now worth more than Brex sold for. Lovable, the Swedish “vibe coding” startup, went from $1.8B in July to $6.6B in December. They 3.5x’d in five months. They’re barely a year old. Cursor went from under $10B to $29.3B in a single year. They raised $2.3B in their Series D. That’s not a funding round—that’s an entire unicorn in a single check. We are now regularly seeing what would have been considered absurd even in 2021: billion-dollar seed rounds, valuations that exceed Brex’s exit for companies that haven’t shipped products, and 3-4x markups in less than a year. Is this driven by real innovation? In many cases, yes. AI is genuinely transformative. Is this also hubristic? Also yes. The same dynamics apply, just amplified. These valuations require these companies to not just succeed but to dominate. They require AI to transform every industry exactly as promised, on exactly the timeline investors are betting on. They require no major regulatory setbacks, no compute shortages, no technical plateaus. And they’re attracting the same mercenaries—talent, capital, and partners who are there for the paper gains, not the mission. Some of these companies will hit their numbers and the valuations will prove justified. ElevenLabs has real revenue. Harvey has real customers. Cursor has $1B ARR. The AI revolution is real. But many won’t hit their numbers. And when they don’t—when the inevitable correction comes—we’ll see the same pattern: mercenaries leaving, narratives turning, “failures” that are actually $3-5B exits, founders blamed for outcomes that were structurally locked in the moment they took hubristic valuations. The difference this time? The numbers are bigger. The falls will be harder. And the schadenfreude will be even more intense. When Thinking Machines is worth $50B and comes up short of expectations, no one will remember that Mira Murati built something real. They’ll call it a failure because it wasn’t worth $100B. When Harvey can’t grow into an $8B valuation fast enough, no one will remember they serve half of the top law firms in America. They’ll say legal AI was overhyped. That’s how hubristic fundraising works. The mercenaries don’t remember the mission. They only remember the paper. For many founders, especially in AI, hubristic fundraising isn’t really a choice. It’s a survival imperative at the very top. The war for AI talent is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Meta is offering $1 billion+ packages to poach researchers. OpenAI is clawing back co-founders from startups that raised $2 billion seed rounds. Google paid $2.4 billion just to acqui-hire 40 people from Windsurf. If you’re an AI founder and you don’t raise at an aggressive valuation, what happens? Your competitor raises at $10B. They can now offer engineers equity packages worth $50M on paper. Your $2B valuation offers $10M packages. You lose the talent war before it starts. Your competitor has $500M in the bank to buy GPUs. You have $50M. You can’t train competitive models. You fall behind on capabilities. Your competitor’s valuation signals “winner” to enterprise customers. Your valuation signals “risky bet.” You lose deals to perception, not product. In many cases, it might be almost irresponsible not to take the hubristic path. The founders who stayed disciplined, who raised at “reasonable” valuations, who prioritized sustainable growth—many of them got steamrolled by competitors who didn’t. So I’m not here to tell founders to avoid hubristic fundraising. In the current AI environment, that might be asking them to bring a knife to a gunfight. Hubristic fundraising narrows your exit options. Not always financially—Brex proved you can still do a “down exit” and create real liquidity. But it narrows what success means for your stakeholders, your employees, your company narrative, and frankly, for your own psychology. When you raise at $12B, a $5B exit isn’t a win. It’s a disappointment. When you raise at $29B, anything less than a $50B+ IPO feels like failure. When your employees joined expecting a $100B outcome, a $10B exit means they’re doing mental math on what could have been. The mercenaries don’t just leave when things go badly. They leave when things go less well than the paper said they would. You can raise hubristically and still build a great company. Brex did. But you need to go in with eyes open about who you’re attracting, what expectations you’re setting, and how the narrative will be written if you come up even a little short. Because the siren call is seductive. The capital, the talent, the press, the gravity—it all feels like winning. And sometimes it is winning. But sometimes it’s just setting yourself up for a “failure” that would have been a triumph at any other valuation. Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras built something real. They went from Stanford dropouts to a $5B+ exit in under 8 years. They served thousands of companies, moved billions of dollars, and built technology that Capital One clearly values. The “failure” narrative says more about our broken expectations than about Brex. But there is a lesson here for founders considering hubristic fundraising—especially the AI founders raising at $10B, $20B, $50B valuations right now: Know who you’re attracting. The capital, talent, and attention that comes with a huge valuation comes with strings attached. Those strings are expectations. And when expectations get too disconnected from reality, you’ll eventually find yourself surrounded by people who were only ever there for the paper. Missionaries stay through the turnaround. Mercenaries don’t. Brex survived their turnaround and found a soft landing. Many companies in the next few years won’t be so fortunate. The question for every founder raising in this frothy AI market—whether you’re building fintech or AI B2B or foundation models—is simple: are you building a company or a casino bet? Are you really, honestly building a $100B generational company? And who exactly is sitting at your table? Because when the cards turn—and they always turn—you’ll find out fast who was really on your team. Just ask Brex. They built a real company, executed a real turnaround, and achieved a real exit. And half the internet is calling it a failure because the number wasn’t big enough. That’s the price of hubristic fundraising. Powerful? Yes. Dangerous? Also yes. Choose your investors, your employees, and your expectations wisely. The mercenaries won’t be there when you need them most.
