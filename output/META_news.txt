Hi OP, Is this prescription glass or normal? Is prescription glass additional cost? F @the eyewear guy would be great for this to be answered Price is for the nom prescription model. Lenses are additional. We don’t have any further info about the prescription lenses available in these meta until 23rd September. Zukko bought oakley? Meta acquired nearly 3% of EssilorLuxottica, which is the parent company of both Ray-Ban and Oakley. Big difference between the gen1 rayban meta compared to gen2. The tech will evolve rapidly with meta onboard I think. Launches 23/9? I've already had mine nearly 3 weeks - bought from Meta site…. that's the limited edition version that only comes in 1 colourway, I think? which is of course only limited to sunglass version Which of these have the HUD in one eye? Seems like it's just the regular Glasses style that already existed. What's new if anything about this? Oakley META frames are the smart-enabled version of Oakley’s everyday frame. They incl Bluetooth audio, voice controls, and touch controls, but do not have integrated HUD or any display in the lens. Oakley’s previous “HUD” product was the now discontinued Oakley Airwave (for snow goggles), not the META line. So the answer is: none of the Oakley META glasses have a HUD in one eye. They’re audio-smart glasses only.

Title: Google owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit

The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. A coalition of more than 50 groups have organised a march in central London against the visit. US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit. President Trump greeted by the King and Queen and other senior royals at Windsor Castle. The Liberal Democrat leader says the UK's pharmaceutical industry is under "attack". The US president's second state visit will see a crowded mix of royal pageantry, trade talks and international politics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

15.09.2025, 20:57 Uhr A jump in the share price of the Google parent company Alphabet on Monday saw its value on the New York stock market rise above $3 trillion for the first time. Alphabet's A shares recently rose by around 4% to $252 on Wall Street. This made them one of the strongest performers in the Nasdaq 100 technology index. By breaking through the three-trillion-dollar mark, the A and C shares of Google's parent company crowned their rally since the beginning of April, when the A shares were only trading at around $145. The shares have gained almost 60% in the past year. This makes Alphabet the fourth most expensive company on the US stock market. Only tech giants Apple, Microsoft and â as the most valuable company â chipmaker NVIDIA, which is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, have a higher market valuation. Analysts see room for further price gains at Alphabet. The trigger for the recent rise was the US bank Citigroup raising its price target for A shares from $225 to $280. Alphabet, along with Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Facebook's parent company Meta, Amazon and Tesla, is one of the "Magnificent Seven" companies listed on the US stock market. The tech giants set the pace for global stock markets and carry significant weight in index funds (ETFs) such as the MSCI World or the S&P 500, which are popular with private investors. powered by dpa-newslab | Legal Notice | About Us / Contact | Privacy

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft's stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has climbed over 30% in the past six months, driven by strong quarterly results marked by improving revenue growth and expanding margins. However, with the stock now trading at 37 times its trailing earnings, the key question for investors is whether MSFT is still worth buying. We believe MSFT stock currently looks expensive due to its elevated valuation. Our view is based on a detailed analysis comparing the stock’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and its overall financial position, both current and historical. While Microsoft shows strong operational and financial performance, these strengths already seem priced into its lofty valuation, as outlined below. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with lower volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%? Let’s explore the key factors we assessed. This table shows how MSFT’s valuation compares with the broader market.

For more details, see: MSFT Revenue Comparison This table shows how MSFT’s profitability stacks up versus the broader market. For more details, see: MSFT Operating Income Comparison MSFT has shown slightly better resilience than the S&P 500 during major downturns, based on both (a) the depth of the drop and (b) the speed of recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock While Microsoft has excelled across financial and operational metrics, its current 37x earnings multiple is higher than other tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta (see how Microsoft’s valuation compares). While Azure’s growth could convince some investors that an even higher multiple is justified, we think from a risk standpoint it’s better to wait for a price pullback before buying MSFT. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a consistent track record of outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with lower risk versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The world's 3 richest people are worth a combined $1 trillion — about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway

The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Larry Ellison, a cofounder of Oracle, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, had net worths of $429 billion, $360 billion, and $269 billion as of Monday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart. It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has about a 13% stake in Meta. The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by about $4 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $167 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 80% since January 1. Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $61 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 30% gain in 2025. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances. Jump to

Title: Tesla stock is rising. Why Elon Musk is a ‘wartime’ CEO.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Tesla stock was rising in premarket trading Monday as CEO Elon Musk gets ready for an artificial intelligence “war." Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were up 1.2% at $400.61 in early trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each rising about 0.2%. The move comes after the stock rallied 13% this past week. Exactly why it rose that much is open for some debate. Technical traders became excited by the recent momentum that took Tesla past the highs reached in the Spring. EV sales were strong in August, according to industry data providers. Buyers appear to be rushing to beat the removal of the $7,500 federal EV purchase tax credit, which goes away at the end of September. Tesla has also received some approvals to begin testing its self-driving taxi service in Las Vegas. Tesla launched a small AI-trained robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes AI is what has investors excited. “Investors are starting to see through the near-term demand issues for Tesla and recognize that Tesla is in a pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity, with Robotaxis set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the US over the next year," he wrote on Sunday. Tesla sold about 721,000 cars in the first half of 2025, down about 13% year over year. That’s the demand weakness to which Ives is referring. Selling fewer cars isn’t good news, but AI simply matters more than car sales these days. “We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla in its history as a company," added Ives. He calls AI a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. “Musk is driving this [AI] vision and is now in a ‘wartime CEO’ mode, which is music to the ears of Tesla bulls with this AI Arms Race happening across the tech world." The arms race might be an apt analogy. AI is driving the stock market with Magnificent Seven stocks valued at some $20 trillion. ChatGPT parent OpenAI is valued at about $500 billion, while Amazon.com, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on AI computing. Some of that is for self-driving cars, Tesla’s territory. Amazon owns self-driving company Zoox. Alphabet controls Waymo. Ives says Musk is the right leader for Tesla at a time like this, calling him the company’s “most important asset." A new pay package, worth up to $1 trillion if all performance incentives are hit, should keep Musk at Tesla until 2030 and beyond. Ives is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy with a $500 price target for shares, the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. The rest of the Street isn’t as bullish. The average analyst price target is about $318 a share, and 44% of analysts rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 2% so far this year, and up about 72% over the past 12 months.

Title: Buy Sell Or Hold Credo Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/buy-sell-or-hold-credo-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Credo Technology stock (NASDAQ:CRDO) surged nearly 10% on Wednesday and has more than doubled over the past quarter, elevating its market capitalization to approximately $28 billion. The firm offers high-speed connectivity solutions for Ethernet and AI infrastructure, including integrated circuits, active electrical cables, and IP licensing. This recent stock surge follows a spectacular first-quarter report, which ended on August 2, 2025, showing revenues soaring 274% year-over-year to $223.1 million. Credo also introduced its Bluebird Digital Signal Processor, a low-power, high-efficiency solution designed to reduce latency and power consumption in GPU communications – a known bottleneck for scaling next-generation AI workloads. The company also highlighted significant business achievements with hyperscalers, who play a crucial role in the AI rollout. So, is Credo stock still a worthwhile investment after the substantial rally, or is it too late? The AI narrative is pivotal to Credo’s expansion. The Bluebird DSP directly addresses power and efficiency issues in optical transceivers, essential for data centers powering generative AI. In Q1 FY’26, three hyperscalers each accounted for over 10% of revenue, with a fourth beginning to increase its collaboration with the company. Management anticipates these four will remain primary contributors through fiscal 2026, while two additional hyperscalers are expected to join. This provides high visibility into future growth, with the company forecasting approximately 120% revenue growth in FY26, significantly surpassing earlier estimates of 85%. For context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) reported they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. If realized, this would establish Credo as a preferred supplier of AI infrastructure components during a time when cloud and chip industry leaders are rushing to expand their GPU clusters. This positions Credo as more than merely a chip supplier; it is emerging as a crucial enabler of hyperscaler AI developments. Naturally, investors must consider valuation. Credo is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 47.3x and a price-to-earnings multiple of 227x – substantial premiums compared to the S&P 500’s 3.3x and 24.2x, respectively. Yet, these elevated multiples indicate more than just hype. Revenues have increased by 176% in the past year to $600 million, with quarterly growth surpassing the S&P 500 by over 40 times. Profitability is also strong, with a 20.8% net margin compared to 12.6% for the broader index, and the balance sheet remains robust, with only $16 million in debt against $480 million in cash. Therefore, overall, Credo is not a speculative cash-burning AI venture, but a profitable, cash-generating growth enterprise with minimal leverage. So, is it too late to invest? That ultimately depends on your risk tolerance. For investors focused on value, Credo certainly appears costly, and its history of dramatic fluctuations – including a 62% drop during the inflation crisis of 2022 – underscores the risks involved. However, for growth-oriented investors, the narrative is significantly more enticing. Credo is addressing one of the largest bottlenecks in AI data centers — power and latency — while strengthening its partnerships with hyperscalers who are central to the AI expansion. If adoption continues at the current rate, the current high multiples may well be justified by the company’s exceptional growth potential. In this regard, Credo stands out as a high-risk but potentially high-reward investment in the infrastructure sector of the AI revolution. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices. What accounts for this? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index, experiencing less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Strategy’s stock and treasury moves have grabbed fresh attention after the company’s executive chairman compared the firm’s returns to those of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants. Short and blunt: Strategy has leaned hard into Bitcoin, and recent numbers make a striking case. According to posts by Michael Saylor, Strategy now holds about 638,460 BTC following a purchase of 1,955 BTC at an average price near 111,196. The company has spent roughly $47 billion, fees included, to build that stack at an average buy price of $73,880. Based on reports, the current value of those holdings is about $71 billion. Those figures sit at the center of Saylor’s argument that his firm’s balance sheet strategy has paid off in ways typical tech plays have not. Saylor also shared a chart that matched open interest against market capitalization. Strategy topped that metric at 100%, while Tesla registered 26%. The rest of the Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — came in well below Strategy’s reading. According to his post, this comparison underpins the claim that Strategy’s market dynamics tied to Bitcoin have outpaced many heavyweight tech names. What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7? pic.twitter.com/wywaAij3Rs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 13, 2025 Based on reports, each of those big tech firms is dealing with different pressures. Apple and Microsoft face tougher regulatory checks. Amazon is seeing slower consumer demand. Tesla must contend with rising competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a strong performer because of AI chip demand, but even Nvidia’s run this year has not matched its earlier explosive gains. Annualized returns presented by Saylor put Strategy at 91%, Nvidia at 72%, Tesla at 32%, Alphabet at 26%, and Meta at 23%. Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon showed significantly lower annualized gains in that comparison. Reports have disclosed that about 12 companies upped their Bitcoin holdings last week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC purchase. Gemini added 1,191 BTC and Bitdeer took on 333.5 BTC. Companies from Japan’s Metaplanet to China’s Cango and the US firm Volcon also added coins. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the 100 largest public holders now control 1,009,202 BTC, which is valued at more than $117 billion today. “What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7?” Saylor asked on X, hinting that Bitcoin—and his company’s bold treasury bet—may offer the answer. Whether investors see it as a challenge or a warning depends on how they weigh Bitcoin exposure against traditional tech growth.

The newly-integrated WooCommerce Product Modules let you design engaging, user-friendly layouts that match your brand and help boost sales, while tapping into all of Divi 5’s features, including Flexbox, to build product pages with modern layout control. In this post, we’ll cover the modules’ key features and show you how to use them for your next Divi 5 ecommerce website. Let’s dive in. Woo Product Modules are specialized content elements within Divi 5, designed to customize product and category pages for Woo-powered stores. These modules replace the WooCommerce templates that come standard with the plugin, enabling you to create customizable layouts. Unlike these traditional templates, Divi 5’s modules allow creative freedom while maintaining compatibility with WooCommerce’s core functionality. The release of 17 WooCommerce Modules in Divi 5 marks a significant milestone. These modules, which cover all product and category page design aspects, are no longer in legacy mode, meaning they are all fully optimized for Divi 5’s modern architecture. With this transition to a more efficient foundation, Divi 5 performs better, is more scalable, and is compatible with the future of WordPress. The remaining 8 Woo Modules, focused on cart and checkout pages, are expected to roll out soon. Let’s go over the key features that you can expect now that the WooCommerce Product Modules have been integrated into Divi 5. The first batch of Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules includes tools designed to handle a specific aspect of product and category page design. These modules are: Together, these modules provide everything you need to build product and category pages, from navigational breadcrumbs to dynamic product displays. Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules free users from the constraints of standard WooCommerce Templates. With these modules, you can fully control your product pages’ layout, structure, and design, creating unique experiences. The modules support dynamic content, meaning they pull product data directly from WooCommerce, ensuring real-time updates for prices, stock levels, and descriptions. This allows you to build pages that drive engagement and conversions without requiring third-party plugins or custom code. Each module has extensive design settings, all manageable within the Visual Builder. You can customize elements like product galleries, sale badges, buttons, and more with options for typography, colors, spacing, and animations. For example, you can adjust the layout of the Woo Product Gallery module to display images in a slider or grid, style the Woo Product Add to Cart button with custom colors and hover effects, or tweak the Woo Product Rating module to align star ratings perfectly with your design. These settings let you create cohesive, branded store pages with ease. Divi 5’s Theme Builder lets you embrace the full potential of WooCommerce Product Modules by allowing you to create global templates for product and category pages. With Theme Builder, you can design a single template that applies to all of the products and categories in your store, ensuring a consistent, cohesive look. The Divi 5 Loop Builder offers an alternative way to build dynamic Woo content. With Loop Builder, you can query WooCommerce products and design flexible product loops using any Divi element, creating layouts, lists, and carousels that go beyond the fixed structure of dedicated product modules. For single-product layouts, use the Woo Product Modules; for product collections and archives, use the Loop Builder. This section will walk you through creating a product page in Divi 5’s Theme Builder using the new WooCommerce Product Modules. Navigate to Divi > Theme Builder in the WordPress dashboard. Click on + Add New Template. Click Build New Template when the dialog box appears. Next, we’ll need to assign our template to our products. Under Products, select All Products to assign the template. Click Create Template to assign it. Click Add Custom Body. This will allow us to build the body of our product page template. Choose Build Custom Body when the dialog box appears. When the Theme Builder launches, you can build a template from scratch, choose a premade layout, or build with AI. We’ll select Build From Scratch for this tutorial. Click the green + icon to add a new row. When the options appear, choose the two-column row. New rows you add to any Divi 5 page or template will use Flebox by default. Divi 5’s Flexbox Layout System gives you more control over how your product pages look than ever, including changing how your WooCommerce Product Modules stack across different screen sizes. Scroll down to reveal the Woo Product Modules option. Once clicked, you’ll have 17 Divi 5 Woo modules and 8 legacy (Divi 4) modules. Find and select the Woo Product Images module and add it to the first column. This Post is selected by default in the Product field in the Content tab. If you’d like to build the template using an existing product, choose it from the dropdown menu. This is a great way to preview how your template will look while creating it. Remember to swap it back to This Post before the final save. Expand the Elements dropdown menu to reveal the settings. Here, you can control which images display in the module, including the featured image, gallery images, and sale badge. Click the Image dropdown menu in the Design tab to reveal the settings. Here, you can force the image to occupy all the available space (force fullwidth), add a border, box shadow, adjust spacing, or add filters. You can also style the Sale Badge by assigning a background color, text, borders, and more. In the 2nd column, click Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Title module. Use the dropdown menu in the Product field of the Content tab to select a product and preview how it will look in the template. Next, navigate to the module’s Design tab and expand the Title Text dropdown menu. Here, you can assign a font and style the heading as you’d like. Under the product title, click to add a new module. Select the Woo Product Modules and scroll to select the Woo Product Price Module. In the Design tab, you can style every aspect of the product’s price, including the text, sale text, new price text, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Rating Module under the Woo Price Module. In the Content tab under Elements, you can choose to show or hide the star rating and customer reviews count. In the Design tab, the Layout dropdown menu lets you choose how to display the star rating. Elements can be displayed inline or stacked. Other styling options include assigning a color, text size, and letter spacing for the stars and styling options for the rating text. Under the Woo Star Rating Module, click to add a new Woo Module. This time, we’ll select the Woo Product Description Module. In the Content tab, choose which description to display (description or short description). In the Design tab, you can style the description with options for font, weight, style, alignment, color, size, and more. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Add to Cart Module. It will allow your customers to add the product to their carts and choose any variations assigned to the product. The Elements toggles in the Content tab allow you to show or hide the quantity field and available stock. Quick note: For the stock quantity to display, you must check manage stock in the Woo product itself. You can style the field labels, text, dropdown menus (for variations), and the button to match your branding in the Design tab. Continue adding modules, like the Woo Product Meta Module to display SKU numbers and categories. You can also add the Woo Product Tabs Module to display a description, reviews, and additional info about your product. For maximum reach, you can display a series of Related Products on your product template to encourage your site’s visitors to explore additional products in your store, increasing the chance of a conversion. Once finished adding modules, make any additional changes you need, and then save the template by clicking on the Save button at the top right corner of the Theme Builder. Next, click the Exit button to return to the Theme Builder dashboard. Back in the Theme Builder dashboard, click Save Changes to save the template and apply it to your Woo products. As you can see, creating a product template with Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules is a simple process. We won’t cover all modules in this tutorial, but using all of them, you can create impressive product or category pages that keep your visitors engaged.

Gemini shares jumped 32% from their IPO price after the cryptocurrency exchange led by the billionaire Winklevoss twins raised $425 million in a packed week for US listings https://t.co/h6zI9W8qlc CBO는 고용은 망하고 물가는 오르는데 외교 참사를 저질러 놓은 '트럼프'의 세법, 관세 및 순이민 감소를 고려한 후 올해 인플레이션과 실업률이 더 '높아지고' 경제 성장이 둔화될 것으로 예상합니다. 암울한 지표들이 매일 쏟아져 나오면서 미국 경제는 위기에 처해 있는 듯합니다. 하지만 월가는 'IPO를 통해' 큰돈을 걸 새로운 방법을 끊임없이 찾고 있습니다.

Elon Musk may be trying to pivot Tesla toward humanoid robots, but to investors there’s no hiding from its stagnating sales and eye-watering stock market valuation that leaves little room for error https://t.co/bsntuQHeIU 테슬라 의장 '로빈 덴홈'은 일론 머스크 외에는 테슬라가 전기차를 넘어 AI와 로봇공학으로 확장하는 데 적합한 인물이 없다고 밝혔습니다. 하지만 일론 머스크가 CEO 자리에서 직접 나서지 않을 가능성도 있습니다. 로빈 덴홈은 일론 머스크의 정치 활동이 전기차 제조업체의 매출을 저해했다는 우려를 '일축'하고 향후 선거 참여에 대한 '폭넓은 자유' 부여했습니다. The Magnum Ice Cream Company expects to generate annual organic sales growth of 3% to 5% from 2026 after it is spun off from parent company Unilever https://t.co/HJ6ugDqefe 실적은 정치병 걸려서 "선거의 신"인 것 마냥 유럽부터 미국까지 사정없이 설쳐댔던 지가 빻아 놨으며, 한 번 훼손된 브랜드 가치는 회복이 불가하기 때문에 개선될 수도 없는데 전기차·배터리는 트럼프가 예산을 삭감했을 뿐만 아니라 사정없이 후려치고 있으니까 어디에, 얼마나 팔 건지에 관한 언급은 없으며 AI·휴머노이드 기대감에 '주가'가 올랐다고 합니다. 허위·과장된 정보로 시세에 영향을 주려는 것을 주가조작이라고 부릅니다.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person on Wednesday, as Oracle’s stock surged due to enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. Why it matters: The tight race between Musk and Ellison highlights the immense wealth generated by the tech industry and the growing importance of AI in driving stock valuations. The details: Since the beginning of the year, Ellison’s position in Bloomberg’s ranking has seen a significant increase, with a $191 billion boost as of Wednesday’s close, while Musk has experienced a $48 billion decline. What’s next: The race for the world’s richest person title may continue to fluctuate, depending on the performance of Oracle and Tesla shares in the coming days and weeks. #LarryEllison has just become the richest man in the world. His wealth is off the charts, and so are his carbon emissions! Along with other carbon billionaires, he’s turbo-charging the climate crisis while everyone else is paying the price.

Title: Why the Oracle-OpenAI deal caught Wall Street by surprise | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure. On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it. Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors. “OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.” Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business. “Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said. But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain. OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom. Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year. Power is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute. Industry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear. Despite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday. Compute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now). But compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups. So far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon. With a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change. The company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.

Title: Klarna CEOs $1 Billion Stock Pledge Pays Off With Surge In Wealth

Klarna Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski didn’t sell any shares in his company’s blockbuster IPO this week — but he still managed to use the listing to consolidate his control over the company. Ahead of the offering, the 43-year-old founder pledged Klarna shares as collateral to secure a $112 million loan, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lender SEB AB provided the funding last month, with Siemiatkowski pledging a roughly $980 million stake in exchange as collateral, based on Klarna’s IPO price and regulatory filings. After securing the financing at a low loan-to-value ratio of 10%, he used the proceeds from the loan to buy out another investor in a special purpose vehicle that owns shares of Klarna, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public information. While Siemiatkowski already controlled the special purpose vehicle, the deal allowed him to further increase his economic interest in the company, the person said. That bet is already paying off. Siemiatkowski’s Klarna stake has risen more than $65 million in value since the company began trading Wednesday, adding to the equity buffering his share pledge, according to Bloomberg calculations. He now holds a stake worth more than $1 billion even after Klarna’s shares fell 6.7% on Thursday, reversing part of an almost 15% surge the previous day. “I’m a big believer in the company,” Siemiatkowski said in an interview. “I’ve signed up for this long term.” A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment on Siemiatkowski’s borrowing. Simmering Tension The size of Siemiatkowski’s stake in Klarna has long been a source of simmering tension inside the company. In the lead up to the IPO, he repeatedly clashed with his estranged co-founder Victor Jacobsson. Throughout 2024, the two argued over governance, including how the company would list and how much control Siemiatkowski would ultimately have in a publicly-traded Klarna. Just three weeks before Klarna first filed to go public in 2024, the firm’s shareholders voted to oust one of the company’s board members, Mikael Walther, after he challenged some governance decisions. Walther had long represented the interests of Jacobsson on the board. The SEB transaction offers a glimpse at how the rich can leverage their assets and the perks banks offer ultra-wealthy clients. While Siemiatkowski is doubling down on Klarna, pledging stock typically helps executives diversify their wealth and boost liquidity without selling part of their major assets. Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison has put up company shares to fund a lavish lifestyle that includes trophy properties, America’s Cup sailing teams and the Indian Wells tennis facility in California. Mat Ishbia, owner of the Phoenix Suns, pledged more than half of mortgage giant UWM Holdings Corp.’s outstanding stock in 2023 to secure loans before buying the NBA team for a then-record $4 billion. Lending against individual stocks or a portfolio of listed holdings is often easier and quicker for banks to process as the value of the collateral is more readily verifiable than less liquid assets such as real estate, art or superyachts. But it can also result in faster demands for extra collateral to cover borrowing costs if the pledge asset’s valuation declines. “Many years back, I sold some” Klarna stock, Siemiatkowski said. “So I can afford a nice house with my wife and we can go on some nice vacations.” Staying the Same After this week’s offering, Sequoia Capital is expected to have about 22% of the voting power, regulatory filings show. Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen’s Heartland A/S is set to have around 8.9%, Jacobsson would have around 8.8% of the votes and Siemiatkowski would have 7.4%. Klarna and its backers ultimately raised $1.37 billion in the listing this week, which saw surging investor demand. Povlsen, CEO of Danish clothing retailer Bestseller, was among the biggest winners from the IPO with his family office notching gains of more than 600% from its investment in Klarna almost a decade ago. He has a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Siemiatkowski isn’t expecting much to change for Klarna as it begins life as a public company. The firm was already providing investors with quarterly updates on its results and it’s faced heavy regulatory scrutiny as its business has grown around the world. Founded in Stockholm, Klarna rose to prominence as a provider of so-called buy-now, pay-later financing, which grew in popularity during a pandemic-era boom in online shopping. More recently, though, the fintech has been making a push into offering other banking products like savings, checking accounts and credit cards. Speaking from his company’s offices in New York on Tuesday, Siemiatkowski was relaxed about the events ahead. While the IPO looked to be going well, the executive was more excited about a recent trip to Bentonville, Arkansas that he’d taken to visit the grave of Sam Walton, the founder of retail giant Walmart Inc. Klarna has been cozying up to Walmart this year after the retailer made the company’s fast-credit options available to its shoppers and a fintech backed by Walmart took a stake in Klarna. “Visiting the grave of Sam Walton and just reflecting on the fact that this kid from Sweden was just about to sign a deal with the largest retailer in the world,” Siemiatkowski recalled. “On an emotional level, unfortunately have to say that beats the IPO.” On Wednesday, Siemiatkowski live streamed his morning from the New York Stock Exchange using his Meta Platforms Inc. smart glasses, giving viewers a birds eye view as he rang the bell on the trading floor flanked by his top deputies and Michael Moritz, Klarna’s chairman. He was also donning a baseball cap with the words “The Last Blockbuster.” Blockbuster was once the largest video rental chain in the country. But as more consumers turned to streaming services in recent years, the company collapsed. There’s now just one Blockbuster left, located in Bend, Oregon. Siemiatkowski’s cap retails for $26 on that store’s website, which doesn’t take Klarna. With assistance from Pei Yi Mak. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Posted on September 12, 2025 by Nick Roach 3 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 23. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t post an update for Public Alpha 22, so this post will cover everything new in Public Alpha 22 and Public Alpha 23. Since Public Alpha 21, we implemented 247 bug fixes and improvements and released two new features, including the new Responsive Editor and Custom Attributes. You’ll notice the bug fixing has ramped up significantly as we near the beta launch, and the team has transitioned away from feature development. Even though the development team is focused on fixing bugs and prepping for the beta launch, I found time to squeeze in a couple of surprise features. Custom Attributes were released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 23. 🎉 This new feature allows you to add any attribute, such as alt, title, rel, and aria-label, to elements and most sub-elements. Divi has had support for specific attributes, such as class and ID, but now you can add any attribute to any element. This is especially important for accessibility, allowing you to, for example, add alt text to images, and roles and labels to non-semantic elements like an icon-based button. The new Responsive Editor was released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 22. 🎉 This editor lets you quickly view, modify, and reset the responsive, hover, and sticky states for any setting while in any view mode. In Divi 5, you get the best of both worlds: natural, intuitive editing, where all changes made while in a particular view mode apply automatically, and the new responsive editor, which allows you to make swift changes to all states at any time. Here is a list of all the changes implemented since Public Alpha 21. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. We aim to enter beta in ~1 month. Almost the entire team is focused on cleaning up the remaining bugs, and we’ll launch the beta as soon as we are confident that we have cleaned up the worst of them. The date we launch the beat will depend on the volume of new bugs reported over the next few weeks. Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it official, and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today.

As hundreds of billions pour into data center development, these are the names making a killing from AI investments. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If there is one unifying theme across the entire AI industry over the past year, it has been staggering, unprecedented investment. Hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into companies the world over, promising enormous innovation and profit-making opportunities in equal measure. Governments and private enterprises have scrambled to keep pace with its rapid evolution, and even if the biggest companies haven't managed to make a profit just yet, that's not stopping the investor dollars from flowing in. That's largely to the benefit of the companies receiving that level of interest and backing, but most of those companies are headed by individuals with large stakes in them. As those investments were announced and company stock prices ballooned in response, so did the personal fortunes of CEOs, founders, and investors, to truly eye-watering levels. Oracle's Larry Ellison "made" over $100 billion in a single day when it was announced his company had struck a $300 billion infrastructure deal with OpenAI over five years, catapulting him into position as the world's richest person overnight. He's far from an isolated example. We've collated a list of notable names who have been the biggest benefactors in the ongoing AI boom. Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in a Denny's in 1993 and, until the mid-2010s, was primarily known within the relatively niche world of PC gaming enthusiasts. However, in the latter years of the decade, he was tipped by Fortune to power the AI revolution, and from the back of that, his personal wealth exploded. By 2019, he was worth $3 billion, ballooning to $100 billion by mid-2024, and reaching a peak of $243 billion in August 2025, before falling to around $157 billion at the time of writing. This tracks almost exclusively with the Nvidia share price. Huang maintains around 3.8% of the company and remains its largest shareholder. Huang is one of the many AI CEOs spearheading the enormous global investment in AI, promising to help build as much as $500 billion in "AI factory" data centers in the U.S. alone by 2029. Even if he doesn't quite hit that milestone, though, Nvidia GPUs are the fastest and most capable for AI training and inference, and that sees no sign of slowing. As the head of the world's most valuable company at the forefront of the hottest investment industry in the world, it would be no surprise to see Huang's personal wealth continue to grow in the years to come. Huang has maneuvered Nvidia into a keystone position in this burgeoning industry. While the likes of Meta used to train its AI on internally developed hardware, today, they use Nvidia GPUs. As does xAI, and OpenAI. Even though Chinese developers can't get the best Nvidia GPUs, they've still bought up H20s in the hundreds of thousands. The plan moving forward is to continue the upsell. Nvidia recently announced its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU platform, which is multiple times faster for AI inference workloads than older Hopper-based designs, and allegedly up to 45% faster running DeepSeek than even existing Blackwell GPUs, like the GB200. Huang is taking the yearly upgrade model that turned Nvidia into a leading gaming business, and applying it to AI and data centers. He's encouraging the building of "AI factories," which are described like money printers: GPUs and electricity go in one end, and money comes out the other. Nvidia wants to sell the world on the "economics of inference," and it wants to sell them the hardware to help them benefit. The new richest man in the world, Larry Ellison is worth $383 billion at the time of writing. He founded the company that would become Oracle in 1977, and remained its CEO until mid-2014, though he retains roles as the CTO and executive chairman. He has a range of business investments that make up his expansive portfolio, including 10s of millions of Tesla shares, and a commanding stake in Paramount Skydance. But it's his 40% stake in Oracle that has seen his net worth expand so rapidly in recent years. In 2020, he was worth around $67 billion, but by 2025, when Oracle was announced as a partner in the massive Stargate project, his net worth began to skyrocket. By mid-2025, it was over $200 billion, and following the announcement of another $300 billion partnership with OpenAI, he became the world's richest man; at least, temporarily. Staying there may depend on the real-world feasibility of the deal. Although Oracle is a company worth in excess of $600 billion, it holds a lot of debt, and will reportedly need to take on a lot more of it to secure the hardware and build the infrastructure it will need to supply OpenAI in the first place. On top of that, OpenAI will have to figure out how to pay for it. With its revenue for 2025 predicted to be between $15 and $20 billion, and none of it profit, it doesn't even generate enough to pay for a portion of a single year of this deal. And still, it's been struck and confident plans made for its commencement in 2027. Oracle has announced its intention to build data center facilities in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico with partner firm Crusoe. With much of Oracle and Ellison's value now resting on the projected annual revenue from this OpenAI deal, both companies will need to follow through to keep Oracle riding high. The youngest member of this list, Alexandr Wang is the current chief AI officer at Meta, a role he received after Mark Zuckerberg invested over $14 billion in his company, Scale AI, pushing his personal net worth up to $3.2 billion. He founded Scale AI in 2016, aged just 19, as a data labeling and model evaluation service. Within five years, the company was worth over $7 billion, and Wang's personal net worth reached a billion for the first time. Wang is estimated to maintain a 5% stake in Scale AI, though the company is not publicly traded, so it's unknown how much any such stake would be worth. Wang is now a prominent figure within Meta and is effectively the head of its AI developments, though presumably with some deference to Mark Zuckerberg. He'll be looking to spearhead Meta's plans for AI superintelligence. Although it doesn't have a definitive definition, it's a lofty goal the company is targeting in an effort to leapfrog the immediate efforts of its contemporaries. Scale AI will run in his absence, but it seems likely to slowly pivot to more government and militaristic roles in the years to come. Wang has been a consistent presence within the tech circles of the Trump administration, and Scale AI has signed deals in 2025 with the United States Department of Defence to use AI to plan ship movements and with the Qatari government to use AI tools in predictive analytics. A fixture on billionaire lists of all kinds for the best part of 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg pivoted from hyping the metaverse to pushing the AI future after the success of ChatGPT in 2022/2023 - although Meta AI has been a branch of Meta since 2013 (then called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research). Although Meta has largely garnered AI-related headlines for its spending habits more than its products, it's still a major player in the AI space, and Zuckerberg has pushed artificial intelligence development as one of the core products of his company moving forward. Much like the Metaverse was before it. Perhaps that's why Zuckerberg's personal wealth hasn't ballooned quite like some of the others on this list, but he still has one of the largest single-day value pops on his resumé. In July 2025, his net worth leapt over $28 billion in a single day after the Meta stock jumped following strong revenue reports. However, at the time, investors were seemingly excited by the potential of Meta's AI investments, which had been aggressive, especially with regard to bringing in talent like Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg has set his AI sights higher than most, though. Where OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic are mostly focused on developing functional AI tools today, Meta isn't competing directly and is instead said to be focusing its research efforts on developing "super intelligence." This would be an AI model with greater than human-level intelligence. It would need to be more functional and capable than even general intelligence AI, or AGI, which is seen as the goal of many AI research and development projects. But since no one has clearly defined that, or shown any sign we're close to such a breakthrough, the idea of doing something much more capable than that in the near term is hard to imagine. Elon Musk is a divisive figure with fingers in many pies. While most of his wealth derives from shares in Tesla and SpaceX, he is also a majority shareholder in xAI, which produces the Grok artificial intelligence most commonly used on Twitter/X. When Musk used xAI to purchase X Corp (X's parent company) in March 2025, it valued the combined holdings of the two companies at $80 billion. He's since gone on to announce he's buying an entire power plant to run AI inference, and hopes to buy 50 million Nvidia GPUs. The xAI valuation contributes mightily to Musk's total net worth of around $400 billion, depending on market fluctuations (at the time of writing, Larry Ellison and he are bouncing back and forth for the top spot). This is close to double his net worth from 2022, but while his AI endeavours have contributed to that, it's the Tesla share price that has been the main driver of his wealth generation. What's next for Musk and his AI efforts is hard to pin down. He's always talked a big game about his companies and services, whether it's promising self-driving cars within two years over a decade ago, or reaching Mars before 2030. His latest claims are that AI will be smarter than a human by 2026 and smarter than the combined intelligence of all humans by 2030. He wasn't clear whether Grok would be the AI to make that achievement. More recently, Grok has been embroiled in scandals where it praised Hitler and allows users to create sexually-explicit deepfakes of celebrities. Even if superintelligence is possible with large language models, there's still a lot of work to do before we get there with the current crop of options. Many figures on this list, such as Musk, Alexandr Wang, Zuckerberg, and more, are all embroiled in a race to develop the most cutting-edge AI models possible. However, Jensen Huang's Nvidia is selling the most powerful chips to power it all. The outlook remains fierce, and with investors still clearly interested in the potential of AI, there could still be billions more to be made for the top names at all of these companies. As the AI race marches on and deals are being struck to democratize AI usage among people and populations, it's clear that the genie won't be going back in the bottle any time soon, even if OpenAI's Sam Altman admits that investors remain "overexcited" about AI.

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross says he's worried AI giants are wasting money — and their stocks could pay the price

US tech titans are spending huge sums to win the AI race — and the ones that lose could see their stock prices take a hit, "Bond King" Bill Gross has warned. The billionaire investor gave his thoughts to Business Insider after Oracle's market value surged by as much as 43%, or nearly $300 billion, on Wednesday, thanks to an AI-driven revenue projection. "My biggest concern is what economists refer to as 'malinvestment,' Gross said in an email. Gross — who cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades — said the tech giants are racing to dominate various AI sectors and "seem willing to risk over-investment in hopes of future monopolies." "Some will fail and current trends — and stock prices based on them — may experience significantly reduced growth," Gross said. He singled out AI data centers and the "hundreds of billions" being spent on them by companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Electricity providers are also "gearing up to supply them," he added. AI companies are investing vast sums in microchips, servers, and other infrastructure they need to build and train increasingly advanced models and harness AI in other ways. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are poised to invest more than $300 billion into AI this year. The immense buzz around AI has lit a fire under tech stocks. Shares of the nine most valuable tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, and Oracle — have all more than doubled since the start of 2023, with Nvidia surging about 12-fold and Meta leaping around six-fold. The group's combined market value now exceeds $22 trillion. Jump to

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

Title: AI hype has just shaken up the world’s rich list. What if the boom is really a bubble?

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.wdun44ema Share article Print article Just for a moment this week, Larry Ellison, co-founder of US cloud computing company Oracle, became the world’s richest person. The octogenarian tech titan briefly overtook Elon Musk after Oracle’s share price rocketed 43% in a day, adding about US$100 billion (A$150 billion) to his wealth. The reason? Oracle inked a deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI with US$300 billion (A$450 billion) in computing power over five years. While Ellison’s moment in the spotlight was fleeting, it also illuminated something far more significant: AI has created extraordinary levels of concentration in global financial markets. This raises an uncomfortable question not only for seasoned investors – but also for everyday Australians who hold shares in AI companies via their superannuation. Just how exposed are even our supposedly “safe”, “diversified” investments to the AI boom? As billionaires go, Ellison isn’t as much of a household name as Tesla and SpaceX’s Musk or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. But he’s been building wealth from enterprise technology for nearly five decades. Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977, transforming it into one of the world’s largest database software companies. For decades, Oracle provided the unglamorous but essential plumbing that kept many corporate systems running. The AI revolution changed everything. Oracle’s cloud computing infrastructure, which helps companies store and process vast amounts of data, became critical infrastructure for the AI boom. Every time a company wants to train large language models or run machine learning algorithms, they need huge amounts of computing power and data storage. That’s precisely where Oracle excels. When Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, driven largely by soaring AI demand, its share price spiked. That response wasn’t just about Oracle’s business fundamentals. It was about the entire AI ecosystem that has been reshaping global markets since ChatGPT’s public debut in late 2022. Oracle’s story is part of a much larger phenomenon reshaping global markets. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – now control an unprecedented share of major stock indices. Year-to-date in 2025, these seven companies have come to represent approximately 39% of the US S&P500’s total value. For the tech-heavy NASDAQ100, the figure is a whopping 74%. This means if you invest in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P500 index, often considered the gold standard of diversified investing, you’re making an increasingly concentrated bet on AI, whether you realise it or not. This level of concentration has not been seen since the late 1990s. Back then, investors were swept up in “dot-com mania”, driving technology stock prices to unsustainable levels. When reality finally hit in March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq crashed 77% over two years, wiping out trillions in wealth. Today’s AI concentration raises some similar red flags. Nvidia, which controls an estimated 90% of the AI chip market, currently trades at more than 30 times expected earnings. This is expensive for any stock, let alone one carrying the hopes of an entire technological revolution. Yet, unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are profitable companies with real revenue streams. Microsoft, Apple and Google aren’t cash-burning startups. They are established giants, using AI to enhance existing businesses while generating substantial profits. This makes the current situation more complicated than a simple “bubble” comparison. The academic literature on market bubbles suggests genuine technological innovation often coincides with speculative excess. The question isn’t whether AI is transformative; it clearly is. Rather, the question is whether current valuations reflect realistic expectations about future profitability. For Australians, the AI concentration problem hits remarkably close to home through our superannuation system. Many balanced super fund options include substantial allocations to international shares, typically 20–30% of their portfolios. When your super fund buys international shares, it’s often getting heavy exposure to those same AI giants dominating US markets. The concentration risk extends beyond direct investments in tech companies. Australian mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue, have become indirect AI players because their copper, lithium and rare earth minerals are essential for AI infrastructure. Even diversifying away from technology doesn’t fully escape AI-related risks. Research on portfolio concentration shows when major indices become dominated by a few large stocks, the benefits of diversification diminish significantly. If AI stocks experience a significant correction or crash, it could disproportionately impact Australians’ retirement nest eggs. This situation represents what’s called “systemic concentration risk”. This is a specific form of systemic risk where supposedly diversified investments become correlated through common underlying factors or exposures. It’s reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly separate housing markets across different regions all collapsed simultaneously. That was because they were all exposed to subprime mortgages with high risk of default. This does not mean anyone should panic. But regulators, super fund trustees and individual investors should all be aware of these risks. Diversification only works if returns come from a broad range of companies and industries.
