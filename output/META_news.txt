Turns out, Meta's AI glasses work just fine with high-strength prescription lenses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Of all the emerging form factors for AI, smart glasses appear to be the most promising. Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem — prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out. To me, Meta makes the best smart glasses on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses. I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, the Oakley Meta HSTN didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses. I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. After months of research, I placed my first order with Lensology, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in "click and fit" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the "Warm Gray" colorway. The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them. I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke. I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the Oakley Meta Vanguard and stumbled upon SVED Optical. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable. SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses. I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days. When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame. I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues. The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great instructional video on YouTube, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames. If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push really hard — you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process. Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk. I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go. Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because Meta glasses are a game-changer, and everyone should get to experience them. The best AI glasses Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera. Garmin and Strava integration are the icing on the cake for fitness buffs. The standard retail versions of the Oakley Meta glasses are not typically sold with prescription lenses installed by default. While you can purchase prescription lenses for the Meta HSTN glasses, they only fall within a certain range. The Vanguard glasses do not officially support prescription lenses. The Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses support a prescription range of -6.00 to +4.00, which is the same range offered by the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. You'll first have to remove the original lenses by pushing them out from the back of the frame. You may have to push quite hard for them to pop out. Afterwards, you snap on the new lenses by pushing them into the from from the front. You must remove the nose piece from the Vanguard and replace it with the SVED nose piece insert with the lenses attached. The prescription lenses will be placed behind the Vanguard sunglass lenses.

Title: Yet More AI Bubble Worries, Now on Debt Side, with Wall Street Journal Featuring AI Datacenter Borrowing “Frenzy”
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/yet-more-ai-bubble-worries-now-on-debt-side-with-wall-street-journal-featuring-ai-datacenter-borrowing-frenzy.html

Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will. All so we can have things like AI targeted data scrapping and ads, lay off entry level workers of all sorts, and OpenAI’s big deal – AI p0rn. Really? Yeah, really: OpenAI’s ChatGPT will soon allow ‘erotica’ for adults in major policy shift https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html China is using AI to do things like reduce the cost of healthcare and enhance manufacturing (I think this is a repeat link): China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 I’ll have to keep looking around at how AI will be used in America hoping to find where it will be used to assist humans doing jobs – I’m sure it’s out there rather than all the crazy AI stuff that actually pops up unwanted. AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks! Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Years of human trials and millions or billions of dollars of investment will happen before the AI- discovered candidate molecules — and I know of plenty — which make it through the process will arrive. That’s how the real world works. New drugs don’t just magically appear. Both these podcast transcripts eventually get to that little fact, so the headline/titles of them are essentially clickbait.

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 16, 2025 by Ben Carlson Michael and I were out in Las Vegas last week to put on a live Animal Spirits at the annual FPA conference. It was a fun trip. We ate some good food, had some fancy cocktails, played some blackjack and talked some artificial intelligence with a few hundred financial advisors. On stage we did a deep dive into what’s going on with the biggest companies in the world and their push for AI supremacy. You can listen to the audio from the podcast here: If you weren’t one of the lucky people in the MGM conference center that day I thought it would be useful to provide some of the slides we covered in our presentation. First up we talked about the shift from investing in intangible to tangible assets by the big tech firms using Meta’s new Hyperion data center as an example: These companies believe AI is worth the investment but this is a risk and a change to their business models. Spending from the hyperscalers continues to go up, up and away: How long will stock market investors allow this? The companies spending money are getting the benefit of the doubt that this will all pay off. I do wonder when the market will want to see a big ROI on this spend. The sheer size of these companies is astounding: The Mag 7 stocks are now as big as the bottom 449 stocks in the S&P 500 combined. It seems we’ve entered the new normal of stock market concentration: At least for now. One of the reasons for this is that fundamentals are matching the stock price gains: Nvidia is now the biggest company in the U.S. stock market but the fundamental growth has exceeded the price growth since the release of ChatGPT. Analysts expect the growth to continue: Is it possible for a $5 trillion company to grow at these insane levels for this long? We shall see. Here’s a real face-blower for you: Apple and Nvidia alone are now worth nearly as much as the health care and consumer staples sectors combined. Here’s another one for you — the market cap of the Mag 7 stocks is now the same size as the energy, materials, consumer staples, health care, financials, utilities and real estate sectors combined. There have been instances of stock market concentration in the past. But we’ve never had corporations this efficient before. If you take this efficiency into account by adjusting valuations for the changes in margins, the market doesn’t appear as expensive as you might think: One of the biggest questions of the AI boom is how much the other companies that aren’t making these investments will benefit. Outside of tech, the margins are much smaller: Will AI improve productivity enough for some of these other companies to increase their margins? That would be something. And finally — the question everyone wants to know — will this end badly for these huge companies? The Mag 7 is no stranger to crashes this decade: When the expectations get out of whack will we see some or all of these stocks crash? And what does a crash look like? A 20% decline is nothing. Meta is down more than 20% from the highs right now: Are we looking at a 40% crash? 50% or more? Would an AI bubble popping offer a wonderful buying opportunity because these companies are still better at what they do than everyone else? Or what if these companies see a payoff sooner than we think and the gigantic crash never comes? I have three words to sum up my conclusion on the matter: I. Don’t. Know. If anyone tells you they know how this will play out they have a horrible case of hubris or just want their investment stance to be proven right. I remain open to a wide range of outcomes on the matter.

Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.

Title: Should you worry about an AI bubble? Investment pros weigh in.

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 18, 2025 / 4:13 PM EST / CBS News Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%. The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability. "The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it," Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called "Magnificent 7" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. Analysis and opinion from The Free Press: That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI. "No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped," Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email. Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is "roughly half" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s. "So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble," they noted. The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting. "This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said. "So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies." Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say. "We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains," Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News. For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a "4th industrial revolution" that could supercharge economic growth. "This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026," he wrote this week in a research note. "The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology," Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Title: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander Presses Spotify On ICE Recruitment Ads

We'll keep digging -- no matter who wants the truth buried. Become a HuffPost member and fuel reporting they can’t silence. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk New York City’s chief financial officer wrote to Spotify Thursday to press the company for details about the recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have been running on the platform in recent weeks. Comptroller Brad Lander, a recent mayoral candidate and notable supporter of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, wrote to Spotify “about recent developments that may violate Spotify’s advertising policies and impact long-term shareholder value.” Specifically, Lander wants to know about ICE recruitment ads on Spotify, which he wrote have “sparked widespread backlash and at least one major national organization is urging Spotify users to cancel their subscription,” a reference to Indivisible’s “Don’t Stream Fascism: Cancel Spotify” campaign. “In too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down,” says one version of the ad, which was recorded by a TikTok user and archived by fact-checking site Snopes. “Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst, with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now.” “From a fiduciary perspective,” Lander wrote, he is “concerned about the reputational risks these ads may create for the company, which could hamper long-term growth, and [wants] to better understand how the company assessed these ads against the company’s stated advertising policies.” Lander wrote that the pension funds “hold significant investments in Spotify.” A spokesperson for his office said that, taken together, the funds have 691,681 shares of Spotify, worth $482,793,542 as of Sept. 30. Spotify’s share price has fallen slightly since then. A Spotify spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement: “This ad itself is part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms, including television, streaming, and online channels. Users can help control their ad experience by liking or disliking an ad or by logging into their account via web browser and updating their ad preferences.” Lander’s letter asks Spotify how it assessed the ads’ against company policy prohibiting “systemic discrimination and marginalization,” and whether the company has assessed “the impact of this controversy on subscriber retention, artist relationships, or brand perception,” among other inquiries. “Hopefully what we’ll get is good answers to the questions we’re asking,” Lander told HuffPost in an interview Friday morning. He characterized the letter as an initial engagement between a representative of New York City employee pension funds — as comptroller, Lander is a trustee of each of the five funds — and a company in which those funds have an investment stake. If Spotify doesn’t have a satisfactory response to his questions, Lander said, the city’s funds could work with other investors to press Spotify for answers or consider a shareholder resolution to do so. “In some cases [in the past], where we have been unable to get answers we are looking for, or have a satisfactory engagement, we have divested from, or sold the stock of, particular companies or sectors,” he said. “We only do that after a lot of engagement. Our strong preference is to use our position as investors to reach resolution. We do this from a responsible fiduciary perspective, believing that what we’re doing is helping increase the value of the companies we’re invested in … we’re just starting here, this is the first letter we’re writing.” The comptroller said he is concerned with systemic discrimination in the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” agenda — “and that includes any ads,” he said. “The mass deportation effort involves a broadscale hiring effort to make ICE the largest law enforcement agency in American history.” Lander noted a trend of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being arrested by immigration agents. “Essentially every time, [it is] a person of color, without, so far as we can tell, lawful basis for many of the arrests,” he said. “If you are conducting arrests without lawful basis, and they are consistently of people of one ethnicity, that is a systemic civil rights violation — and I believe these ads are part of it,” he added. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, doesn’t advertise exclusively with Spotify. Recruitment ads to become an immigration agent have also appeared on platforms including X, YouTube, LinkedIn and Meta, and on cable television, The Independent noted. Separately, DHS has spent millions of dollars on advertising pressuring people to “self-deport.” Lander said Thursday’s letter was specifically regarding Spotify’s “quite strong anti-discrimination policy — and we’re asking for how they assess these ads against that.” Lander’s letter amounts to a shot across the bow for Spotify. As comptroller, he has a legal “fiduciary” obligation to act in the best financial interests of New York City’s pension funds. As well as trustee, the comptroller serves as an investment advisor and custodian for the five funds — one each for police, firefighters, educators, non-pedagogical educational workers, and other city workers. While he does not have unilateral control over the pension funds, he has influence over the funds’ administration. Lander noted that the five funds’ responsible investing program is staffed by the comptroller’s office and that “we do a letter like this in consultation with our boards.” Combined, the funds have over $300 billion in assets under management, making them the fourth largest public pension plan in the country, according to the comptroller’s office. Lander’s office shared the letter, which is addressed to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, with HuffPost. Lander himself has been arrested by federal agents twice in recent months at the immigration court in lower Manhattan, where agents have been systematically arresting migrants showing up for scheduled court check-ins — and where Lander frequently observes proceedings. “We owe it to the families of those detained — and every New Yorker impacted by Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine — to keep showing up and demanding accountability for the violence, cruelty, and lawless abduction of our neighbors,” he said last month after pressing DHS for answers about the return to duty of one particularly violent officer. Spotify isn’t only facing pressure over the ICE advertisements. Ek’s venture capital firm, Prima Materia, recently led a 600 million euro funding round for Helsing, a European military technology company, which led to an exodus of artists from the platform.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason! The venture capital playbook is broken. Not bent — broken. In the latest 20VC x SaaStr episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll dissect why even Sequoia is making dramatic leadership changes, why seed investing at $50M pre-money might not work anymore, and what it actually takes to build venture returns in the age of AI. This isn’t your typical venture conversation about “exciting trends.” This is three investors with $3+ billion in combined AUM telling you what’s actually working, what’s spectacularly failing, and why the old playbook from 2015-2022 is now a liability. On Venture Capital Evolution: On AI Investment Strategy: On Deal Dynamics: On Portfolio Construction: On Fundraising Process: On Market Dynamics: When Sequoia replaced Roelof Botha as managing partner after just three years with Pat Grady and Alfred Lin in a split leadership structure, the venture world noticed. But the reaction from our panel was telling: this wasn’t about interpersonal drama or normal succession planning. “Whenever you have a CEO change happening in venture, it’s because something isn’t working,” Rory stated bluntly. “This is dissatisfaction about how the firm is doing relative to the competition. They missed some rounds and some deals. They passed on some great companies.” But rather than viewing this as a Sequoia-specific challenge, the panel sees it as symptomatic of a broader industry issue. “More people should be stepping aside today,” Jason argues. “VCs, executives, founders. Most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” Rory adds context: “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” The meta-lesson? Even the best firms are struggling to keep pace with AI, which means everyone else should be asking themselves hard questions about whether they’re still the right people for this moment. And Sequoia gets credit for one thing: ruthless decisiveness. “They did not do that fatal error of saying it’s someone’s turn so we’ll leave him in,” Rory notes. “They ruthlessly said, if we’re going to compete, we need these people, not those people.” Michael Burry made headlines (again) by shorting Nvidia and Palantir to the tune of $1.1 billion. Unlike most pundits who just discussed whether he’d be right, Jason actually did the math on what it takes to make money on these bets. “It brings home how hard a business it is to bet against AI capex,” Jason concludes. “You not just got to be right, but you got to be right on timing.” Rory’s take: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” The counterpoint to all this short-selling cynicism? The revenue is actually showing up. OpenAI is projected to hit $20B ARR this year, while Anthropic projects $70B ARR by 2028. The growth rates aren’t just holding — they’re accelerating. Harry drives this home: “Are we being overly British? Are we looking for a problem that’s not there? The revenue is showing up in billions.” The lesson: It’s intellectually easy to be a skeptic about AI valuations. It’s financially hard to make money being that skeptic. And meanwhile, the actual revenue keeps proving the bulls right. Few stories capture the AI revenue opportunity better than Gamma’s latest round. The company raised $100M at a $2.1B valuation, having hit $100M in revenue with just 50 people and 2 million users. Harry, Jason, and Rory are such a great combo. One of the top shows every single week. https://t.co/NB29EhA02T — Grant Lee (@thisisgrantlee) November 13, 2025 Jason and Team SaaStr are super-users and he walks through exactly how they use it at SaaStr: “Instead of sending sponsors the same dated prospectus, Gamma automatically pulls all of our data from Salesforce and our marketing automation system. It knows the exact number of leads and ROI. It knows who their competitors are and makes a fully dynamic piece of collateral in about 10 minutes.” Here’s the math that’s important: SaaStr pays $100/month for Gamma — $1,200 per year. That’s stealth TAM expansion. “How much do we spend for Google Slides? Zero. It’s built in. How much do we spend on PowerPoint? I don’t even know where my key is to Microsoft Office. So it is a stealth TAM expansion.” But Jason’s most important insight is about what’s coming next: “The lame thing about co-pilots is they were just tools. When the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk, the amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” He distinguishes between AI as a tool versus AI as a team member: “It is sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. The level of autonomy and capability — Gamma, go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, review once, and distribute to the team.” But there’s a warning embedded in Gamma’s story too. Canva now has a Gamma clone that’s “pretty good.” The competitive response time has collapsed from years to months or even weeks. This leads to one of the episode’s most important debates… This might be the single most important strategic question facing every seed and Series A investor right now. And the panel doesn’t fully agree on the answer. Jason frames the problem: “The quality of clones is only going up. I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader. The ability of AI to enable us to clone better stuff faster — Canva is borderline competitive with Gamma and wasn’t when Cliff was on the show. What does seed investing mean when you might see 10 better versions in 30 days?” Rory’s response: “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale. Once you become the anointed winner, once a market coalesces and there’s two or three people, you know, it’s yours to lose.” But Rory pushes back on the idea that this makes seed investing impossible: “You just have to internalize the game you’re in. Awesome team, run fast, be superlative on technology, get your distribution early, and then rely on that. You can’t be anointed the winner up front. Get over it everybody.” Jason’s concern is economic: “Is that okay at 50 post for a seed round? Do the outcomes justify it? If I’ve got to spread $5 million checks around at 50 post, it’s tougher.” Harry asks the critical question: “Are we getting paid for the risk?” He notes that even at the Series B stage, it’s unclear who will win in many categories. Looking at customer support AI companies that have raised Series B rounds: “I got no idea who the winner is in that category and I don’t think anyone does to be honest.” The debate crystallizes around whether you can know enough at the B to justify the valuation: Rory’s view: By the Series B, you can see rank order. “Once the horses are running and once they round the first furlong, you can actually see the rank order of where they’re running in a way you can’t at the early A.” Harry’s counter: Looking at codegen — even with clear leaders like Cursor emerging, you have Codex making incredible ground, Claude Code advancing, and Replit and Lovable coming from different angles. “I think that’s still entirely up for grabs.” The practical implication: This uncertainty means one of two things: Jason’s conclusion: “Maybe you need 40 deals at $5M. That’s $200M for first checks. $200M for reserves. That’s $400M. $100M for fees and backup. I need at least $500M for my little seed fund to make the math work.” Amid all the complexity, the panel crystalizes a simple framework for what actually works in AI investing right now. DataDog crushed earnings, with stock up 23% and $15M+ in AI-native customers. Why? They’re selling to the people making AI, and as those companies grow, DataDog sells more too. Jason: “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies. They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the Replit story — Jason deployed 20+ AI agents that generate significant revenue while requiring substantial daily management but far less human headcount than traditional approaches. The key distinction: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story. But when it’s real, when the AI agent is sufficiently autonomous to complete material high-value tasks, that’s when you’re actually part of the team, not just a tool.” “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly. I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” But he’s skeptical this is as compelling as the first two: “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” If you’re not doing one of these three things, you’re probably not going to see explosive growth. Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage. One of the most tactically useful segments came when Harry shared a founder interaction that frustrated him: the company said they wanted to “run a process” despite Harry offering terms they’d stated they wanted. Harry’s reaction: “I said, listen, if you’re running a process, you’re either optimizing for price or partner selection. I’m giving you a great price today that you said you wanted, which means you’re not optimizing for price. Which is just saying you think you can get better than me. In which case, just tell me straight.” Rory sees both sides: “From the founder’s side, they’re correct. I see more failed financings because they didn’t run a process than because they did.” But then he makes a critical distinction: “What typically happens when people ‘don’t run a process’ is someone comes in, says they’re interested, and the founder shares information serially to someone not yet ready to commit. That’s a mistake. That’s running an accidental process.” Jason has the most nuanced take on optimal strategy: “The best founders cultivate enough interest with enough good VCs that if they hit the number, they just send an email. Harry, I’m thinking about raising around before the end of the year. And Harry could say, I’ll give you a term sheet today. And the right answer is: ‘I love you, Harry. I’m not ready today. I will be ready at the end of the year.'” The key insight: “The optimal way to run it is for everyone already to want to invest for real without games before you open your data room. The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” Rory synthesizes: “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are. If a founder is smartly nurturing relationships, keeping people broadly informed, then tries to time the interest such that when they’re ready to put their hand up, there’s three people who are primed and ready to go — that is perfection itself.” But here’s the brutal caveat: Jason points out that this only works if you have stellar numbers. “You’re either YC, Neo, South Park Commons, got something, get funded — or who the hell is going to find you? You better be hot AI-native with top-quartile venture growth or you ain’t getting funded.” Harry shares a data point that proves this: A company that grew from $400K to $3M ARR (classic enterprise SaaS, 10x growth) had 120 meetings and got one term sheet at $10M on $40M post. That’s 12x revenue for a 10x grower — which five years ago would have generated five term sheets from top firms. “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason concludes. “You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” While DataDog surged 23%, Duolingo crashed 25% in the same week. The contrast illustrates everything about what’s working and what’s not in AI. Jason’s diagnosis: “Duolingo has the ‘wrong’ kind of AI. Duolingo is using AI to make its product better. Hooray. Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” Rory pushes back slightly on behalf of consumer apps: “If you’re an infrastructure company, you can co-attach to compute. If you’re a new AI apps company, you are using that compute. But if you’re like Duolingo — preexisting — what you can do is co-adopt the technology.” But Jason sees a bigger problem: “Duolingo took money from Berlitz and all these language schools. Hooray, you did that. Now, where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory makes an interesting point about where the AI opportunity in education actually is: LLM learning is equivalent to one-on-one human tutoring. What AI should enable in education is allowing everyone to get one-on-one learning instead of group-based learning. But there’s no budget in K-12 to give every kid a customized tutor. The market is adults wanting to learn a second language for business who would pay for a one-on-one coach — a niche market. Jason’s framework applies here too: “If you’re not removing humans from the equation, you’re going to be heavily discounted. You’re either getting money from compute or you’re getting money because you’re using AI to replace humans. Otherwise, congratulations on your 14% growth.” One exchange revealed how different the panel’s approaches are to portfolio construction — and why both can work. Harry revealed his team’s meeting load: “With my four investing partners, we have 80 net new companies that we meet in person per week.” Jason’s response: “I would resign. I would give you all my carry back. I sold my companies because I didn’t want to spend my life in meetings. I’ll do one a week, two max.” But Jason’s critique cuts deeper than meeting volume: “When you do 200 deals between your team, you got to meet 500, 600, 700 founders a year. I don’t want to meet 500 founders a year. Unless you’re great, you’re going to blow my mind. But if you’re not, I’m gonna start yawning about 15 minutes into this meeting.” Rory defends the high-volume approach: “Even on an okay deal, you learn nuances about a specific market from the one-on-one that you wouldn’t get from the presentation. The person inside living it every day has a crucial kernel of knowledge that you just can’t access any other way.” But the conversation reveals a deeper truth about fund construction: The Small Fund, High Multiple Approach (Hummingbird-style): The Large Fund, Maintained Ownership Approach (Lightspeed-style): Rory’s key insight: “Both are great outcomes. They’re just different ways to play the game. The interesting thing is both outcomes have great outcomes for the GP. But if you only have $1 to play with as an LP, you want the small fund 10x. If you have to deploy $100M, you have to do the big fund. The high small fund accept the follow-on dilution but make a marvelous return is the compelling product for the marginal dollar.” Speaking of Hummingbird, their Billion to One investment deserves its own section because it represents what’s possible when everything goes right. Hummingbird did their first bio deal in Billion to One and now has an $800M position on the IPO — likely representing an 800x+ return on their initial investment from a sub-$100M fund. Harry marvels: “You want freaking great venture returns? Credit due. Amazing.” But Jason asks the tactical question every seed investor should be asking: “How did they collect the capital as a seed manager to deploy enough to maintain the ownership? I don’t see how I’ll ever own 18% of something at IPO ever again.” The answers are telling: Rory makes the crucial point: “You can accept some dilution and optimize for multiple rather than ownership. If you put in $4M and get diluted from 20% to 12% but it’s a $5B exit, you’re a hero.” Jason counters with what’s exciting about capital efficient outcomes: “Navan at $4.5B, Billion to One at $5B — the power of capital efficiency and running lean delivers superior investor returns despite smaller headline valuations.” The lesson: Small funds generating 10x+ returns by accepting dilution but betting on capital-efficient companies may be the optimal strategy for seed investors who don’t have the deployment capacity of mega-funds. Pulling all these threads together reveals several uncomfortable truths: 1. The Middle Class of Fundable Companies is Gone “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason states flatly. The classic SaaS triple-triple-double-double company? A company growing from $400K to $3M ARR would have had five term sheets from good firms. Now: 120 meetings, one term sheet. 2. Most People from the Last Decade Should Step Aside This isn’t ageism — it’s pace of change. “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade,” Jason argues. “I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today. We don’t even need half the VCs we have today for the AI world.” 3. Diversification Matters More, Not Less With increased variance in outcomes and compressed time to clone, the math says diversification is critical. But diversification at seed prices requires massive funds or acceptance of lower ownership. 4. There Are Only Three Ways to Win Attach to compute budgets, replace human headcount, or massively displace incumbents. If you’re not doing one of those three things, you’re probably building a slow-growth SaaS company in a world that doesn’t want those anymore. 5. Capital Efficiency Delivers Superior Returns Billion to One at $5B and Navan at $4.5B generated better investor returns than most $20B+ outcomes because they raised less capital. The lesson: optimize for investor returns, not headline valuations. 6. The Best Fundraises Don’t Feel Like Processes Cultivate relationships over months. Have 3-4 investors ready to commit before you formally raise. Send one email and get multiple term sheets. That’s the optimal path. 7. If You’re Not Excited, You Should Retire Jason’s most important point: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” The panel is clear about what’s coming: “This year was AI works. Next year is AI is part of your team.” That transition — from AI as a tool making you more efficient to AI as an actual member of your team with autonomy, knowledge, and capability — is where the revenue explosion happens. Jason’s final thought captures the optimism underlying all the tough talk: “If you’re not incredibly excited right now, if this isn’t one of the most exciting and stressful times simultaneously, you’re missing it. This is a great enormous mega trend. It’s the biggest mega trend maybe since the early days of the internet. Leaning into it is the only sensible thing to do, and playing against it is dumb as rocks.” The old playbook is broken. The new playbook is being written in real-time. And the investors who figure it out — whether through small concentrated funds like Hummingbird or large diversified portfolios like Harry’s approach — will capture the extraordinary returns available in this moment. Everyone else? Maybe it’s time to buy that beach house. On Venture Evolution: “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” — Jason Lemkin “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” — Rory O’Driscoll On AI Investment Strategy: “Tools are great when the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk. The amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” — Jason Lemkin “Sell to the people who are making AI and if they grow, you’ll sell more too.” — Jason Lemkin On Defensibility: “You just can’t take that early first month explosion as seriously as you used to. It’s not as defensible.” — Harry Stebbings “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Market Timing: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Fundraising: “The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” — Jason Lemkin “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Current Reality: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either getting funded or you ain’t seeing it anywhere.” — Jason Lemkin On Taking Action: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. You had a great run.

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. CNET's top budget virtual reality headset is even cheaper right now, with some retailers offering instant credit, too. Get it while you can. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. Black Friday is coming up fast and it's an excellent chance to pick up all sorts of tech. While it's great to stock up on essentials when they're on sale, we always like to peek at a few luxuries, too. They're just easier to justify when the price is right. Right now, that means it's a great time to think about getting a good virtual reality headset. The Meta Quest 3S, which is already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Best Buy and Amazon. You can get the 128GB model with a game included for just $249 at Best Buy. If you want the 256GB model, the headset on its own is down to $330 plus a $50 credit thrown in at both of those retailers. This deal ends Sunday at Best Buy and we assume Amazon will follow, so you'll need to be quick if you want it. If you shop at Amazon, you won't get a discount on the 128GB model, nor does it come with any credit. However, the 256GB option includes Batman and it's $70 off, bringing it down to $330. Amazon is also throwing in a $50 credit that you can spend on anything at Amazon. If you're heading to Best Buy instead, you can save $50 on the 128GB model, plus it comes with The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners game. And best of all, Best Buy is throwing in a $50 gift card that you can spend in-store or online. Best Buy has the same $70 off offer on the 256GB model and is also throwing in the $50 gift card with this model, too. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. The Meta Quest 3S has improved CPU and graphics, which makes it great for gamers. It also has a noticeably lighter design compared to the previous Quest 2 and it has approximately 3 hours of battery life. It's the budget version of the Quest 3 headset but it's like comparing the iPhone 17 to the iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro version comes with added benefits but the basic version should serve all of your needs without breaking a virtual sweat. CNET's Scott Stein, VR expert, said in his review, "If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed-reality evolution in the years to come. And if you're thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy, and you're not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be." Stein also labeled it as "by far the best value in VR," in his review. Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving but it's rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don't pop up every day. If you've been wanting to invest in one of Meta's headsets, you should do it now while it's available at a lower-than-usual price.

Title: In the age of AI, CEOs quietly signal that layoffs are a badge of honor
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/14/ai-ceos-quietly-signal-layoffs-badge-of-honor/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T09:42:03Z
Full Content:
Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation. No silver bullet for New York In the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich tells Diane Brady and Kristin Stoller that most global cities are grappling with affordability issues. "New York is a global capital, but it comes at a price,” he said, citing Vienna as a city that’s doing well but weaponizing affordability as a political tool while London is “dark and it’s not lively anymore” because too many wealthy buyers have bought second, third and fourth homes in the city center. AI bubble fear hurts stock markets Stocks markets fell dramatically yesterday—and the selling looks set to continue today, according to the futures markets—led by investors expressing their disapproval over spending on AI. Oracle shares are down almost 30% over the last month as investors flee Larry Ellison’s debt-fuelled pivot to AI. “The Big Short” investor closes investment firm, maintains AI bubble stance Investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 housing bubble and dramatized in the film “The Big Short,” closed his investment firm on Wednesday and quickly took to X to continue his warnings about an AI bubble. Burry, who has already bet $1 billion against an AI bubble, explained how companies like Meta and Oracle are understating the depreciation of their AI investments to inflate profits and play down their massive capital expenditure programs. Microsoft and Amazon want restrictions on Nvidia sales to China The two AI hyperscalers have been lobbying for a change in the law that would keep Nvidia’s best chips in the U.S. market and curb its access to Chinese customers. Delta CEO criticizes government shutdown Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the U.S. government for expecting employees to work without pay during the government shutdown, which he described as “disruptive both for his business and its customers. “It was completely unnecessary,” Bastian said in conversation with YahooFinance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, and customers had to “bear the brunt of the dysfunction.” OnlyFans CEO has no middle management at her company OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair decried “that squidgy layer of middle management in the middle” during an appearance at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday, arguing that “nobody’s ever had a really good middle manager in my experience.” Instead, at her company, they hire only “incredibly senior talent” and “incredibly hungry junior talent.” S&P 500 futures are down 0.21% this morning.

Title: Exowatt has a rock-solid plan to provide cheap, abundant energy for AI data centers

UPDATED 21:32 EST / NOVEMBER 13 2025 by Mike Wheatley Exowatt Inc., a solar-thermal energy startup backed by OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and other high-profile investors, wants to solve the artificial intelligence energy crisis with millions of hot rocks. To do that, it has raised millions of dollars – $50 million in fact, led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries. Today’s round also saw participation from other investors that included Atomic, Bridge Bay Ventures, the Florida Opportunity Fund, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global and Massive VC. The round is described as an extension of the company’s original $70 million Series A, which closed in April. Altman’s involvement stems from its original seed funding round in 2024, where he was one of several angel investors. Exowatt says its thermal battery technology, powered by solar energy, has the potential to provide enormous AI data centers with electricity at rates as low as one cent per kilowatt-hour, which would make it around 90% cheaper than the average U.S. grid rate. If it can do this, it’s sure to be of enormous interest to AI data center operators such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Oracle Corp., which are all desperate for energy as they scramble to build out their infrastructure. With data centers springing up across the country, operators are desperate to secure a power source for them, but grid queues in some locations can stretch for years. As a result, data centers are being built faster than power suppliers can keep up. Exowatt is pitching a somewhat unconventional solution to this looming crisis, with millions of superheated rocks held in storage that can provide energy around the clock. The company’s solar-thermal energy works by using concentrated solar power to heat up special ceramic or rock-based materials to temperatures as high as 1,200°C when the sun is shining. These materials act as thermal batteries, releasing the stored heat to power steam turbines that generate electricity, even when the sun goes down. It transforms rocks into a power source, and once the system is set up and in place, it can provide electricity much more cheaply than through conventional means, which typically cost from eight to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The math is compelling, especially when considering the future energy requirements of data centers. Today, these facilities consume about 1% of the world’s electricity, but the demand for AI is forecast to push that up to around 3% to 4% by the end of the decade, Exowatt says. Exowatt’s challenge is that it needs to gear up its manufacturing operation to produce 1 million thermal battery units per year. It said this target is necessary for it to deliver on its penny-per-kWh promise through economies of scale. Doing so is easier said than done, though, considering that Exowatt has only built a handful of batteries so far. Still, it has gotten enough backing to at least attempt to reach that goal. Altman is one of a number of voices in the AI industry who has been quite vocal about the need to solve the looming power bottleneck, and many of his rivals are pursuing different ideas. For instance, Meta Platforms Inc. is exploring nuclear energy, particularly the use of small modular reactors that can be located close to its data centers. Google LLC has also invested in a number of nuclear energy startups, as has Amazon. Aside from exploiting more fossil fuels, renewable energy is really the main alternative to nuclear power, and it is certainly popular with environmentalists, but the problem is that solar- and wind-farms require affordable and reliable storage solutions to be able to meet AI’s power demands 24/7. Most existing energy storage systems use lithium-ion batteries, but they’re very expensive and there are concerns around the availability of the rare earth elements needed in their construction. Thermal storage provides some advantages. The rocks and ceramics are much cheaper, and they’re also more durable. Exowatt says its rock-based storage systems can maintain heat for about five days and they never degrade – unlike lithium-ion batteries, which gradually lose capacity over the endless charging cycles they have to endure. That said, there are questions about the real-world performance of Exowatt’s system, which has never been attempted at such a large scale, as well as grid integration. Previous solar-thermal energy projects have suffered with efficiency problems and unforeseen maintenance costs, and Exowatt will have to show that its batteries can deliver on its cost promises and operate in diverse climates. That may be why the company hasn’t yet announced a specific timeline for deploying its technology, nor any major customers. Even so, Exowatt has the capital, the demand and timing on its side, and if it can scale up its technology to achieve its ambitious price targets, it might just become the rock on which the future AI industry is built.
