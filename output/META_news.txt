Title: How Meta’s Metaverse Bet Went From Awkward to Wow

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta’s Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma’s mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future — and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Beauty Features Marla Beck on Her Plans for Hydrafacial Parent Company BeautyHealth Technology Online Returns Reduced With AI-powered Virtual Fitting Room Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban’s bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking — so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them — as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress — as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta’s Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype — which isn’t Meta’s first, but it’s the first to be showcased publicly — the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. “So with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence — like you were right there with another person,” Zuckerberg explained. “This is where we are going.” The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg’s “One more thing” moment, echoing Steve Jobs’ penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a “buy” rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. “We call this Hyperscape,” said Zuckerberg, “and the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.” He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham’s studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual Döppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot — perhaps a döppelbot — that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. “Meta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you’re going to,” said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language — Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta’s Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta’s Puma collaboration wasn’t part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta’s Web Platform Team teased “the future of e-commerce” through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset’s camera pass-through view. But it’s not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item’s color, and “experience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,” according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There’s a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset’s live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there’s nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. “A lot of the stuff we’ve been talking about for a long time … glasses, mixed reality, AI — it’s happening,” Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. “And you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it’s pretty awesome.” Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There’s no ship date or retail price announced yet — again, because it’s a prototype — but it will likely top the rival device’s $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it “impressive,” given that “most other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,” he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is “several years (and tens of billions) away from general release.” In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year — Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) — none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. “With the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,” JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. “The political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,” he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. © 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault—and the raft of plush brands he oversees—seem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault’s fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business’s stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH’s share price bounced 14% from €617.50 to €703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault’s fortunes—after all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion—leapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world’s richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini—the CEO of Moncler—and one of the brand’s largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH’s influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: “The luxury consumer is all shopped out.” It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ position—the same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. “‘Quiet luxury’ has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,” the group wrote. “The industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at €1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).” And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Fortune Swells To Over $200 Billion—The Metaverse Masterstroke

The trek into the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg has been anything but smooth. His once-risky bet, which cost him more than $100 billion, appears to be paying off handsomely now. His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge. Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk. Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it. Some doubters think Meta’s performance produced more loses than advantages. Some critics have argued that Zuckerberg’s fortune has been less in the metaverse concept itself than in his endeavors to benefit from recent AI leaps. Interestingly, Meta made huge financial stabilization efforts. This includes the initiation of its $50 billion share buyback program and also reduced 25% of its workforce for the sake of streamlining the organization. Zuckerberg continued to support the metaverse despite financial issues. He passionately discussed integrating the actual and virtual worlds at recent events, envisioning a period when people communicate via holograms or avatars. Nonetheless, a few shareholders and insiders are advising caution. They’ve voiced reservations about investing further funds in what many consider to be a project that is still a long way from becoming widely accepted. Furthermore, there’s a growing belief that Zuckerberg ought to focus on Meta’s main applications, which generate almost all of the company’s income: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As the tech sector gets more competitive—especially with rivals like Google and Amazon making major advances in artificial intelligence— Zuckerberg might wish to rethink his goals. As Meta continues to introduce fresh goods, such as the Quest 3 VR helmet and Ray-Ban smart glasses, these innovations should eventually help the business to increase its income. Still, many investors who would rather see gains sooner rather than later harbor great skepticism. Future prosperity of the company will depend critically on its capacity to include fresh technologies into its current systems.

By David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 54, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) This week, I’ve been reading about AI slop and sports betting and Jony Ive, clearing my schedule for the new season of The Great British Bake Off, watching Sicario and Pirates of the Caribbean and A Quiet Place: Day One on plane-seat screens like their directors intended, insta-subscribing to Hasan Minhaj’s new YouTube show, and just relentlessly trolling people with Vergecast clips through Pocket Casts’ new feature. I also have for you a couple of new Meta gadgets, the mobile game that will eat up all your free time, a couple of hotly anticipated new movies, the best Spotify feature in forever, and much more. So much going on! Let’s dig in. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be reading / watching / playing / trying / building out of clay this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.) / A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. Fun fact: Joanna Stern is the main reason I ever got a job at The Verge in the first place. (That story is long and, if I remember correctly, involves her playing a fairy in a video? But I promised her I wouldn’t tell that story.) These days, she’s a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, an Emmy winner, and most recently, the creator of Joannabot, the AI chatbot that will tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 16. (And apparently also do some other things, if you’re clever enough, but again, we’ll leave that alone.) I asked Joanna to share her homescreen because she just reviewed the iPhone 16, which means she just had to set up a homescreen. And because she’s forever using new gadgets and switching between things, I was curious what always made it to the top of the pile. Here’s Joanna’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: I’m submitting my homescreen and my Control Center screen because I’m proud of the work I did on the Control Center. I may submit it for an award. But really, I’d like to just use this as a forum to complain about the all-in-one connectivity widget in the new Control Center in iOS 18. I don’t like it. I like the single buttons so I can easily just turn them on and off or long-press to get in there. Sadly, they have gotten rid of the single Wi-Fi button, but I read on this great website that it’s coming back in iOS 18.1. The phone: iPhone 16 Pro Max. The wallpaper: This is my dog Browser. It isn’t the best shot of him, but the framing is nice for putting him in the middle of the screen. My lockscreen wallpaper is this awesome retro iPod made by a designer named Shane Levine. I bought it through this site last year after featuring it in my newsletter. The apps: WSJ, ChatGPT, Apple Notes, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Instagram, YouTube, Clock, Threads, Signal, Photos, Slack, Spotify, Phone, Safari, Messages, Gmail. My apps are so basic and make me feel so basic. I work (Slack, Gmail). I message (Messages, Signal). I listen and watch things (YouTube, Spotify). I social media (Threads, Instagram). I work more (Google Docs, WSJ). If it isn’t on this main homescreen, I usually just search for it. Before iOS 18, I had a widget stack on the homescreen with weather and time zone widgets, but I moved it off to another screen. I might move it back. I might not. Got to live a little. I also asked Joanna to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she shared: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. And for even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. “Sliding Seas. It’s a match-three (or four!) game but also so much more: there’s real strategy required behind your moves to beat levels at the higher end, but it’s never unfair, and while there are in-app purchases and power-ups you can buy to make a level easier, you crucially never need to.

Integrated it into my Obsidian vault to help summarize and organize things into specific formats. It’s been extremely cool!” – Cody I’ve had back-to-back-to-back-to-back trips over the last two weeks, and I would just like to quickly shout out my new No. 1 travel hack: a wall charger that doubles as a big-ass portable battery. I have this Anker model, which is $55, charges a USB-C and a USB-A device simultaneously, and also charges itself so I can get 10,000mAh of power when there’s no outlet nearby. (There’s also a newer one with two USB-C ports and even faster charging but less battery capacity.) It’s huge and heavy, but this thing and a long cable are now the only charging gear I travel with, and they’re the only reasons my gadgets have survived trains and plane rides. Here at Installer, we love a sensible charging strategy, and this is as sensible as it gets.

Title: Are Stocks Overvalued?

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology’s superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner’s cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, “It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.” In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn’t an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn’t feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft downgraded, Micron rally ‘will sustain’

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! D.A. Davidson analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from a Buy to a Neutral rating on Monday, maintaining their $475 price target. The firm pointed to increasing competition in AI as the reason for the revision, noting that rivals have largely caught up to Microsoft’s AI capabilities. This, they argue, "reduces the justification for the current premium valuation." Microsoft’s stock has soared by 92% since January 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which gained 49% over the same period. But now, D.A. Davidson analysts believe that Microsoft's lead in cloud and AI is narrowing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP) have demonstrated similar growth rates, which has closed the gap in cloud business expansion. “Our new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in terms of deploying their own silicon into their data centers, which gives them a significant advantage over Azure going forward,” they said in a note. Microsoft’s Maia chips are still behind Amazon and Google by several years, with their current use limited to Azure OpenAI Services workloads. This, according to D.A. Davidson, places Microsoft in a challenging position in the competitive data center landscape. Another concern raised by the analysts is Microsoft’s reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for data center operations, which could lead to a shift of value from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia’s. Microsoft’s operating margins are under pressure due to rising data center capital expenditures, which have jumped from 12% to 21% of revenue. “This is a higher rate of increase compared to Amazon and Google, a result of Microsoft’s greater reliance on NVIDIA,” analysts continued. “Every year Microsoft over-invests at these rates, it will diminish margins by at least 1pp in a cumulative manner. Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment in order to offset the margin drag.” Also, the firm expressed concerns about the sustainability of Azure’s revenue growth, hinting that it could be inflated by contributions from OpenAI's self-funded revenue. This week, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) kicked off its developer-focused event, Meta Connect, unveiling its latest hardware and software innovations. One of the key highlights was the launch of the Quest 3S, the newest virtual reality (VR) headset from Meta's Reality Labs division, offered at a more affordable price than its predecessor. Also, Meta introduced a new prototype of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses and revealed updates to its Meta AI chatbot. The chatbot now includes a voice interaction feature, allowing users to engage through both spoken and written commands. Here’s what analysts said after the event: Citi: “Meta’s new AI products, features, and devices announced at Connect ‘24 make us incrementally confident that its product innovation can deliver increased engagement and monetization as the ROI from its AI investments continues to expand.” Bank of America: “We think AI Glasses have much broader market potential than VR Googles. While Metaverse spend still seems hard to justify, with glasses long-term investors may have some renewed optimism on Meta’s opportunity to be at the forefront of the next generation of personal computing devices. “More importantly, the company appears to be successfully innovating around new AI capabilities, driving usage growth which can offset terminal value concerns, and we see Meta as the top AI pick in consumer Internet.” JMP Securities analysts said earlier this week that Google's enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by increased use of its Gemini platform. "We are seeing signs that enterprise adoption of AI is inflecting." At Google's "Gemini at Work" event, the tech giant highlighted a 35x surge in Gemini platform usage, with 75% of daily users reporting improvements in work quality due to AI. JMP Securities views this as a clear signal of a turning point in enterprise AI adoption. The firm credits Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for removing barriers to AI adoption by achieving compliance with key standards like SOC 1, 2, 3, and HIPAA, and forging integration partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). These efforts have resulted in 85 new enterprise use cases over the past six months, driving meaningful cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for businesses. JMP Securities also stressed the growing importance of AI as corporations focus on technological transformation. Google’s integration of AI solutions with both first- and third-party data is improving accuracy and functionality, further boosting enterprise AI usage. The firm noted that generative AI usage by enterprises has surged 15x, while adoption of AI agents has grown by 6x. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) saw its shares jump nearly 15% on Thursday after delivering an optimistic first-quarter revenue outlook, driven by strong demand and pricing for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial to the rapidly expanding generative AI sector. The chipmaker, a key supplier to Nvidia, added approximately $15 billion to its market capitalization as its stock surged around 27% over the past three weeks. “It’s really not a good day to be short memory and semi-cap equipment stocks,” a Mizuho analyst remarked after the report’s release and Micron’s stock jump. “For the memory and semi cap equipment bears, I would advise against going down in a ball of flames and cover shorts and consider getting long some key semi winners even if you dislike MU and not willing to chase this 15%+ rip at the open,” the analyst added. “Personally, I think the MU rally will sustain and pull in many of these long/short haters who will flip from short to long at least for the near term.” Micron is shifting its focus away from lower-margin segments like PCs and smartphones to higher-margin, high-value products, such as HBM chips for servers and data centers. Mizuho highlighted that Micron management is confident their technology leads in both power and performance, outperforming competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung (KS:005930). Following Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) latest earnings report published this week, Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, raising the price target to $395 from $329. Despite Accenture's overall FY25 guidance meeting expectations, analysts are optimistic about several underlying metrics. The company's first-quarter forecast exceeded consensus, with strong bookings of $20.2 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x. moreover, Accenture’s workforce expanded significantly, adding 24,000 employees, marking a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter increase. “The setup for FY25 seems attractive as full-year guidance assumes no improvement beyond 1Q,” analysts wrote. One of the key growth drivers was in Generative AI (GenAI), where bookings and revenues grew approximately tenfold. In FY24, GenAI bookings hit $3 billion, with revenues of $900 million, up from $300 million and $100 million, respectively. “Importantly, the company is starting to see some scaled GenAI projects; and an increase in the number of data projects and security-related work ($9B in revenues, +23% growth),” Piper Sandler’s team noted. “Overall, we believe owning ACN is attractive, given improving top-line metrics, a conservative guide, and that it is a key beneficiary of GenAI-related work.”

Title: How to Create AI Images: A Complete Guide With Expert Advice

Here's what to know about creating AI-generated imagery, including the best programs, practical tips and legal considerations. AI image generators open up a world of creative possibilities. A picture is worth a thousand words. But with generative AI, you'll need to start with words to get that image. Generative artificial intelligence tech has exploded in the past few years, leading to a lot of creative services that can generate entire images and video clips. That's the "generative" aspect of gen AI -- it can produce content seemingly from just a simple text prompt. Of course, the actual process is more complicated. AI image generators rely on a database of existing content (text, images, videos, etc.), and/or scrape the open web for information to create new images to fulfill your request. They allow anyone with an account and a prompt to create almost any kind of image (usually within reason). There are a lot of AI image services available, but not all will deliver quality results or adequately protect your data. They also vary in price and features offered. While AI generators can be exciting to explore, getting started can quickly feel overwhelming. That's where this guide comes in handy. I've tested and reviewed multiple AI image generators for CNET and covered how the new tech affects digital creators. These services are certainly interesting and serve their purposes, but there’s a learning curve to them. While they're not good enough to replace human creators, they offer a range of creative possibilities. Here's how you can create custom AI images. I've had hands-on experience with many AI image generators and creative programs. The best program for you is going to depend on your project, budget and experience level. You can check out our full reviews and rankings, but these are my three program recommendations. CNET's Editor's Choice is Dall-E 3 by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Dall-E boasts impressive prompt adherence, handling more complex prompts with ease. Its conversational flow -- meaning you can follow up easily by typing in the chat window -- allows for easy post-generation editing. Dall-E is also one of the more creative programs we've tested. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus account to access the program -- $20 per month -- and note that OpenAI may use your content for model training. But you can submit a request for it to stop training on your data. If you're looking for a free program, I recommend Leonardo AI. Canva recently acquired it, but you can still use it on its website. Leonardo offers a robust free plan, with more editing tools behind its paywall, and several artistic styles to choose from. It also provides a unique prompt improvement tool, which can take a simple idea and rewrite it, filling in details that make for beautiful end results. If you're really balling on a budget and have no creative experience, check out Canva's Magic Media generator. It's extremely intuitive and easy to navigate, which is great for beginners and non-creatives. Canva offers you 50 free credits for image generation (those are lifetime credits -- you'll have to upgrade for more credits on the paid Pro plan after using up your free tier allowance) and automatically opts you out of training its AI on your content. Once you've picked your program, create an account and make your way to the prompt window. Your best chance of success starts with a well-written prompt. Every prompt should include the basics of the characters, the setting, other elements and the image's dimensions. But to really hone in on the image you want, add descriptions of the artistic style you're looking to mimic, the aesthetic, vibe and specific colors. Leonardo might not understand a prompt that asks for "cottage core coastal grandma," but it does understand "rustic feel with blues and warm light." AI image generators rightfully have limitations around what you can generate. This is to prevent people from abusing these services to create illegal content and potentially dangerous or offensive content. For example, Dall-E 3 will decline to generate images that request public figures by name, like President Biden or Taylor Swift. Be sure to check out your service's safety policies before generating. Prompt engineering -- the process of writing the right prompt to get your desired results -- is something you get better at with practice. It also varies between each image generator. Canva, for example, tends to do better with simple prompts, whereas Dall-E encourages longer, more detailed prompts. Playing around with your program is the best way to get to know it. You can also check out my complete guide to image prompt engineering for more tips and tricks. Once you've got your best prompt, go ahead and generate! Even with the best generator, you're likely need to edit your images after they're created. Depending on the service you use, you may have access to editing tools or the ability to request changes. Be wary of over-editing your images. I've found that services can only handle so many changes before the image becomes too wonky, and ultimately unusable. Take this image I made in Midjourney as a cautionary tale of what happens when you over-edit. Sometimes it's best to start anew. Post-generation editing tools are one area where AI services tend to shine or fall flat. If your service doesn't offer them (or they don't work very well), try editing your prompt rather than the picture. In my experience, that's going to give you better odds of success rather than trying to incrementally edit existing images. It's extremely important to label your images as AI-created content. As AI image services improve, it's essential that all creators clearly identify the origins of an image, especially to distinguish it from human-created art and photography. In the bottom left corner, Meta AI watermarks all its AI-generated images. Some services automatically add a watermark or other marking indicating it's AI-generated, but too many don't, like Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Midjourney, Canva and Leonardo. If you're sharing your image online, make sure to include the AI service you used in the caption, credit and/or alt text. You can also add a disclaimer to your posts if you're sharing on social media -- Meta might flag them as containing AI content on Instagram and Facebook, but adding a line to your caption will help ensure there isn't any confusion. As of publication, the use of AI image generators is legal. But there are important legal and ethical considerations you should be aware of when creating AI images. Here are a couple of quick frequently asked questions. AI image services like Midjourney and Dall-E rely on existing content to help them create pictures. This content, either in a database or on the open web, is typically created by humans. As such, some creators and artists have major concerns about how these programs are designed and trained. That's led to uproar in the industry and a couple of notable lawsuits, including an ongoing case against Stable Diffusion, an AI model used by popular generators. If you're worried about using a service that might potentially mistreat creators, pick one that clearly discloses how it trains its model. Some AI services rely on public databases, like Adobe Stock and Getty Images, where creators sign agreements with the companies to enter their work into those collections for specific uses. Adobe Firefly, for example, says it only uses content from its Adobe Stock public databases and images whose copyrights have expired. It also won't train on your content. As these AI services evolve, the legalities and ethics around them are poised to change as well. If you're going to be a regular AI art creator, make sure you stay up to date with the latest requirements, which we'll cover in our AI Atlas guide.

Title: Meta Debuts the Quest 3S, Its Cheapest Mixed-Reality Headset

Meta announced several products at its Meta Connect 2024 event in California, but Quest 3S stood out for many reasons. It’s the company’s cheapest mixed-reality headset, featuring a similar chipset (Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) and software functionalities as the older and pricier Meta Quest 3. Meta Quest 3S features a refreshed Meta Horizon OS that better supports 2D applications. Meta says the new OS will also deliver improved spatial audio and better Passthrough contrast and color. The new Quest 3S is compatible with all applications and games in the Meta Store. Also, the headset comes bundled with exclusive games (like Batman: Arkham Shadow) and Quest 3-specific performance updates. Despite sharing a similar form factor, the Quest 3S and Quest 3 have varying display quality, optical lenses, and camera setups. The new Quest 3S has its sensors and Fresnel lenses arranged in triangular clusters, while the Quest 3’s Pancake lenses and sensors have a pill-shaped setup. Additionally, Quest 3 has a better display (2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye) and will provide more realistic graphics and sharper videos than the Quest 3S (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye). The Quest 3 remains Meta’s most powerful mixed-reality headset. However, the new Quest 3S doesn’t seem like a watered-down version, especially spec-wise. Quest 3S starts at $299.99 for the base (128GB) version and $399.99 for 256GB, while the 512GB version will retail for $499.99. Interested buyers can pre-order the Quest 3S from Meta’s website before it hits the shelves on October 15. In other news, the retail price for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 is dropping from $649.99 to $499.99. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. The company says it’ll sell whatever’s left of both models through the end of 2024 or until they’re out of stock. According to Meta, the new Quest 3S will provide outstanding value “both for those new to VR and those looking to upgrade from Quest or Quest 2.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from the PS5 Pro preorders to Meta announcing its Orion AR glasses

Here's your firmware update for September 28, 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What a week this was, folks. Meta Connect 2024 introduced us to a new VR headset, its first AR glasses prototype and slew of Meta AI upgrades – including an in-development skill to live dub Instagram reels. We also said hello to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, reviewed the new Legend of Zelda title, and prepared ourselves for heartbreak in 2025 with the arrival of The Last of Us season 2's first teaser trailer. In case you missed all that, we've rounded up all of these top tech news stories below so you can get up to speed on everything that happened in the last seven days. On Tuesday (September 24), Nothing unveiled its inaugural set of open-ear buds and TechRadar’s audio editor couldn’t help but share her initial thoughts. She’d already said she thought it was the best idea Nothing's had in ages (questionable ‘Ear Open’ moniker aside), and after slipping them on for a few hours, they didn’t disappoint. Ear Open are so very Nothing; their friendly praying mantis aesthetic is so very likeable. And just as the company's Nothing Ear (a) impressed for a competitive fee, these buds are likely to be a huge hit in the open-ear space. That's particularly true given that they cost just £129, ie. the same price as the flagship Nothing Ear (which means your US and Australian prices are almost certainly $149 / AU$249). Compare that to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, with their $299 / £299 / AU$449.95 price-point. See? Slip 'em on and they feel like nothing, too. The fit is excellent – even putting both on at the same time is a cinch. You get the trademark transparent-meets-monochrome-meets-titanium Nothing design language, plus on-ear pinch control, although there’s a knack to it now, purely because you need to locate where the old 'stem' idea is, to pinch. Oh, and the Advanced EQ setting? It's another level… We won't be surprised if not too many Nintendo fans are reading this, because right now they're probably all playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This highly anticipated entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise is something of a landmark, letting players explore Hyrule through the eyes of Princess Zelda for the first time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And the good news is that it's great. It combines elements from classic Zelda titles with a wealth of new mechanics for an adventure quite unlike anything that we’ve seen before. Tasked with closing sinister rifts that threaten the kingdom, you journey through a charming open-world and experiment with a suite of magical abilities. These let you create copies of certain objects whenever you need, which is just as fun as it sounds; a summoned bed might be good for a quick nap in isolation, but makes for the perfect bridge over a perilous chasm when multiplied and stacked. You can even spawn friendly versions of enemies to fight on your behalf. It’s all wrapped up in an adorable art direction, making everything from the characters to the world look like it was plucked straight from a cute diorama. Check out our review below. This week we were treated to our first new trailer for The Last of Us season 2, and we’re convinced it's going to be as emotionally devastating as the videogame it’s based on. Released as part of this year’s The Last of Us Day celebrations (September 26 is the day the Cordyceps infection ravaged the world of the game/show) we got both a two-minute S2 teaser and a confirmation that it’s coming sometime in 2025. The teaser gives us our first glimpse of characters players know from the games, including Abby and Ellie's love interest Dina, as well as providing hints at what Ellie and Joel have been up to following the 'five years of peace' that followed the events of season 1. Fans of the games know it’s not all sunshine and roses for the survivors, though, so we’re going to take these next few months to emotionally prepare ourselves for what The Last of Us has in store for us come 2025. Samsung launched the Galaxy S24 FE alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra this week, and the new phone looks like it’ll prove the cheapest route into Samsung’s Galaxy AI ecosystem. Among the S24 FE’s hardware upgrades over the Galaxy S23 FE are a bigger 6.7-inch display, a new Exynos 2400e chipset, and longer battery life. But while that would be enough to make it a contender in the cheap flagship stakes, it's the phone's AI tricks that we're most excited about. Chief among them are its AI-powered ProVisual photography engine, which it inherits from the standard Galaxy S24 and which should bring improved low-light performance and optical zoom quality. In our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review, we described Samsung’s new device as “a great value phone for its power and features,” so here’s hoping it lives up to that billing once we’ve put it through our full review process. 3. Meta’s affordable Meta Quest 3S broke cover The least surprising announcement of Meta Connect 2024 was nevertheless an exciting one – the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S. This affordable alternative to the Meta Quest 3 still packs a solid punch with its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, and 8GB of RAM, but only costs $299.99 / £289.99 / AU$499.99. In exchange you will have to accept a couple of downgrades – less sharp displays, a bulkier body, and the loss of the depth sensor – but by all accounts the Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset at its price, and looks like it could be perfect for people looking to dip their toes into XR as we head into the holiday season. We also saw Meta’s first fully functional AR glasses – the Orion prototypes. These aren’t something anyone will be able to buy (though some are being given out as developer kits to help software creators make apps for the official specs), but from what we’ve been shown Orion looks amazing. And it’s only set to get better, with Mark Zuckerberg promising the consumer pair will boast better displays, a more fashionable design, and a more affordable price. Although on that last point, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth later clarified that Meta meant affordable in terms of smartphone and laptops rather than at “a Quest 3S price point, or even a Quest 3 price point.” It suddenly feels rather like 2020 all over again. That's because pre-orders for the forthcoming PS5 Pro and the limited-edition PS5 30th Anniversary Collection went on sale this week – with predictable results. Such as? Well, such as the official PlayStation Direct website quickly being inundated with would-be buyers all eager to get their hands on Sony’s upcoming consoles and kit. Many had to wait in digital queues for upwards of an hour, just to be in with a chance of pre-ordering the mid-gen refresh, and there were reports of crashes and timeouts and (inevitably) scalpers. Most PlayStation Direct stock sold out completely that same day; the 30th Anniversary Edition bundle was gone in minutes across the US and UK, while the limited-edition PS5 Slim, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal models were quick to follow. Some stock still held on, however, and at the time of writing, Sony’s website still has PS5 Pro units available to pre-order.

Title: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscales-bullish-forecast-the-top-20-crypto-to-watch-in-q4/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T05:00:30Z

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has published an in-depth report outlining sectors poised for bullish growth in the final quarter of the year amid a notable recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for major players such as Bitcoin (BTC) and various altcoins, which have reached price levels not seen in over two months. In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum’s performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana’s capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the “Superchain,” which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase’s Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Helium’s inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale’s preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale’s framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter’s adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale’s top 20 list is Bittensor’s TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.

Title: Everything Meta Announced At Connect 2024
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-2024-everything-announced/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:26:54Z
Full Content:
Meta announced so much at its Connect 2024 conference that you may have missed some of it. But never fear! Here's a brief summary of every important Meta Connect 2024 announcement. For full context and details, read the articles linked. Meta launched a new headset, simplified its Quest 3 lineup, discontinued Quest 2 and Quest Pro, and launched new official accessories. After months of leaks, Meta finally announced its new headset: Quest 3S. Effectively, Quest 3S is a cheaper Quest 3 with a bulkier design, inferior lens clarity, and lower resolution. Quest 3S has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and fixed single panel from Quest 2 to achieve a starting price of $300. All purchases of Quest 3S until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Meta is discontinuing the 128GB base model of Quest 3 and cutting the other 512GB model to its $500 price. Until stock is gone, the 128GB model is on clearance sale for $430. Like with Quest 3S, all purchases of Quest 3 until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Quest 2 was the first mainstream VR headset and Quest Pro was an innovative failure. Quest 3S will take Quest 2's place in Meta's lineup. But there's no direct replacement for Quest Pro. When it's gone, Meta will no longer offer a headset with eye tracking or face tracking. One aspect of Quest Pro that Meta will offer a replacement for is its open periphery design, because it's releasing an official Open Facial Interface for Quest 3. Instead of being a halo strap, the official Open Facial Interface still presses against your face. But the space between the interface and the headset itself is empty, allowing you to see the real world. Quest 3S is getting its own exclusive facial interface accessory. The "Breathable" Facial Interface makes the tradeoff of not being opaque to "help you keep cool while working out or playing intense games". You can now buy the Logitech MX Ink tracked stylus for Quest headsets. Logitech MX Ink is designed for both 2D drawing on a physical surface via its pressure-sensitive tip and for 3D creativity via full 6DoF positional tracking (via the headset cameras), multiple buttons, and a haptic feedback actuator. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be: Official YouTube cowatching will finally launch as a beta next week. YouTube cowatching will take place in Horizon Home, meaning you'll see other people as their Meta Avatar alongside you. Quest 3 owners in the US can try photorealistic scenes via Meta's new Horizon Hyperscape demo app. UploadVR's Don Hopper tried Horizon Hyperscape and found it to be significantly higher quality than Gracia, with a "stark difference" in visual clarity. Amazon launched an all-new Prime Video Quest app that supports passthrough and downloads. Prime Video is the first major streaming service officially available on Horizon OS to support downloads, making it ideal for use on airplanes with the Travel Mode Quest headsets now have since May. Quest headsets will be able to extend Windows 11 laptops by just looking at them, without installing any software, later this year. Meta says this will be possible thanks to a partnership with Microsoft. Your laptop's screen will turn off and be replaced by a giant virtual screen, and you'll be able to spawn entirely virtual extra monitors. The new Meta Avatars system with overhauled graphics will launch on Tuesday. And some time next year, Meta will allow users to generate a new outfit by typing, leveraging generative AI. In Horizon Worlds, Meta says it will also support "fantastical avatars", non-human forms which users can unlock in specific worlds. In a surprise announcement, Meta revealed that it will give developers access to the passthrough cameras of Quest headsets via a new API next year. Meta hasn't yet said whether there'll be any restrictions to the Passthrough API, but we'll keep a close eye on the company for any further details of this exciting upcoming capability, which could unlock entirely new use cases for Quest headsets. Meta says Horizon Worlds creators will be able to add AI NPCs to their worlds next year. These AI NPCs will be able to "engage in conversations, help people out, and even compete in games". Meta teased "the future of Horizon OS", showing a concept of a complete redesign. Meta didn't give even a rough timeline for the new Horizon OS interface, and what was shown appears to be a concept. Triangle Strategy, a turn-based tactical RPG from Square Enix, is being adapted for VR this year on Quest. On Quest, Triangle Strategy's VR adaptation promises a "whole new look" across the battlefield, letting you reach out to units and issue commands directly. Home Sports is a new mixed reality multi-sports game that rolls five sports into one collection on Quest 3. An exact release date remains unconfirmed. Resolution states Home Sports "will be launching soon" for the Meta Quest 3 family. Supernatural Together is a new expansion that adds group-based workouts to the fitness app on Quest. Team Workouts feature special Challenge Zones and Victory Tunnels that "require teamwork and coordination to complete." Meta Horizon Store, the app store on Quest headsets, will allow developers to submit 2D Android apps. Meta will be hoping this brings some of the most useful and entertaining apps from the Google Play Store. However, the lack of Google Play Services will make it challenging for some apps to be ported. Meta Spatial SDK lets developers easily build apps for Quest's Horizon OS with traditional mobile development tools, without a game engine. It provides rendering, optional passthrough, controller and hand tracking, support for flatscreen and immersive media playback, physics, and spatial audio. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are getting a swathe of new software features, as well as new transitions lenses styles. The following features are coming "soon": And these features are coming "later this year": Further, EssilorLuxottica and Meta launched new style options with Transitions lenses: Meta showed off integrated prototype AR glasses with a field of view that's remarkable given their form factor. However, the Orion glasses won't be sold as a product, as Meta admitted each costs on the order of $10,000 to produce. The company said Orion will be used as a demonstrator and internal development kit, describing it as "a time machine that lets us live in the future".

Title: 6 Best Paid Social Marketing Campaigns to Pay Attention to

You are here: Influencer Marketing Hub » Social Media » 6 Best Paid Social Marketing Campaigns to Pay Attention to Sure, the great thing about social media marketing is that it’s essentially free. However, social media networks’ impressive targeting capabilities and wealth of campaign data make them ideal for running paid ads. Plus, when you combine influencer marketing and paid social, you can maximize the reach and impact of your campaigns further. Here are campaign examples of how some of the leading brands have leveraged paid social marketing, along with actionable advice to generate the same level of results. Top Paid Social Media Marketing Examples:1. JBL2. Oscar Mayer3. Lidl 4. Volkswagen5. Warner Bros.6. PricelineHow Can Brands Create Better Paid Social Marketing Campaigns?Key TakeawaysFrequently Asked Questions For an example of how to combine paid social with influencer marketing and use a disruptive product message, there’s JBL’s JBLiens Ear-n-vasion campaign which ran in December 2023. Apple has been dominating the true wireless stereo (TWS) market since 2020 and JBL needed to use an unconventional way to cancel the noise that Apple was making. JBL’s products focus on customization, allowing users to express their individualism and be their authentic selves. To communicate their focus on individualism, JBL worked with Nick Kosir (aka The Dancing Weatherman) who shared sightings of JBLiens, easily observable by their “ear-dividuality” as breaking news. A post shared by Nick Kosir (@nickkosir) They also worked with Flyana Boss, an American hip hop duo with nearly half a million YouTube subscribers. In addition to YouTube and Instagram, they also used TikTok. Katie A. Raymond, Director of Strategy, Content, Social Media and Paid Media at HARMAN International, JBL’s parent company, sums up the campaign’s success in a LinkedIn post as follows: “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” Oscar Mayer, a Kraft Heinz brand that sells meat and cold cuts, brought home the bacon with the #OscarTakeMeToProm campaign. It’s a great example of how to combine: As part of their marketing efforts, Oscar Mayer uses an iconic wienermobile that gets driven around by their brand ambassadors across America. Each year, they receive several requests for rides in their wiener-on-wheels. These requests typically come from students. Oscar Mayer However, social listening revealed that teens thought that the Wienermobile would make a pretty cool ride to the prom. Oscar Mayer then turned to their group of brand ambassadors to create and share content via their official Oscar Mayer social accounts. Using paid and organic efforts, they launched a UGC contest on Instagram and TikTok. The campaign did exceptionally well on Instagram. It generated a 65% increase in reach on Instagram, while the content’s engagement rate exceeded the platform’s benchmarks more than 170%. For an example of how to use social media for a holiday campaign, there’s Lidl GB’s multi-channel Christmas activation. The discount retailer chain released a spoof of East 17’s only number-one single, “Stay Another Day”. The campaign parodies both the song and original music video. One of the reasons why this paid social campaign works is because the spoof also features Tony Mortimer, one of the English pop band’s original members. As Coolr, the social media agency behind this campaign, explains in their “Save Another Way (...the Lidl Way)” case study, his inclusion works on two levels. It improves the sense of familiarity among viewers as well as adds a type of endorsement. It also works because it combines social good marketing. Aside from promoting their rewards app, Lidl GB also donated £100,000 to NSPCC’s Childline service. The campaign was run on: It was particularly successful on TikTok and Instagram where it generated nearly 68 million impressions. To maximize reach and awareness on TikTok, the agency used the premium TopView placement on TikTok. The judges of the Global Social Media Awards commended it for its “social-first approach”. The content was created with social media in mind from the start. For example, the full, 4-minute music video was uploaded onto YouTube, while a shorter version was shared on TikTok, known for short-form video content. Plus, this way they could also encourage users who watched the short version on TikTok to go to YouTube to watch the longer version. The short version on TikTok generated nearly 1 million clicks to YouTube. PHD, one of the globe’s media agencies with the most awards (which includes being named Adweek’s Global Media Agency of the Year), created this campaign for Volkswagen to help them launch their new ID. Buzz. Electric vehicles might be quiet, but the market is noisy. With Volkswagen boasting only a 4.2% share in terms of unit sales, it needed a special force to create a buzz. To do this, they partnered with Disney and Star Wars to connect the automotive brand strategically with these iconic cultural elements. The social strategy used familiar and beloved characters like C-3PO, R2D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ewan McGregor to improve electric vehicle consideration. McGregor also happens to have loved the VW brand since a kid and owns a couple of VW buses, elevating him to a level of brand ambassador. The strategy was adjusted for each social channel. For example, Meta was reserved for video-only campaigns using the platform’s available video placements. On TikTok, the agency could be slightly more playful. Here, they created a Star Wars community for fans. As two major brands were working together on this campaign and each had their own marketing agency, a solution was needed to collaborate without confidential info getting shared. The Force Is Strong, United! case study shared on The World Media Group’s website, explains how they created a Data Clean Room directly in PHD’s planning tool. This way, they could optimize all digital bidding strategies. Using an AI-powered automated process, data could be compared so that bids across both campaigns could be matched to prevent mutual high-bidding effects. The Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Did we do ‘Kenough’” campaign is another example of how the agency PHD UK used paid social effectively. PHD Linkedin post The strategy included: As a case study of this award-winning campaign explains, the challenge of this campaign was to change the movie’s perception. Unlike the actual dolls, the movie’s plot didn’t have the same target audience. As the movie had a broader appeal, it made PHD UK’s keyword audience strategy so much more effective. That said, while the plot tackled more serious topics like feminism, the agency found more than “kenough” room to add elements of playfulness. Plus, it also helped to set it apart from Oppenheimer, Barbie the Movie’s summer release competition sharing the same release date. To do this, all communication touchpoints had to place the movie and its trademark pink into pop culture and be positive. The Drum Like Volkswagen, Priceline also worked with a TV star, Kaley Cuoco, best known for her roles in The Big Bang Theory and The Flight Attendant, for their social media campaign. This way, they could also leverage the Emmy-nominated actress’ huge following on social media. In the ads created as a series of funny episodes, Kaley encourages her coworkers to book their dream vacation by using Priceline’s affordable travel options. As incentive, more than $5 million in hidden, interactive deals were made available exclusively via social ads, making the campaign a great example of how to add an element of gamification. MIRIMAR If that were not enough to grab attention, each episode features an original theme song. This theme song was also released on streaming platforms. In addition to streaming platforms and social media takeovers on Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, they also used audio and podcast ads. Combine these deals with the original music and travelers were given multiple reasons to break into song. In addition to illustrating the benefit of using elements like music and gamification, this campaign also highlights the importance of target audience research. A survey commissioned by Priceline revealed that 76% of US workers are happier when they travel, yet more than 50% identify price as a reason for not traveling. With this data, they could ensure that the core messaging of their campaign offers a solution to their target audience’s pain point. These 6 award-winning paid social marketing campaigns highlight a few tips that brands and their marketing teams can use. Here’s what they teach us: Understanding your target audience is crucial, even more so when you’re running a paid campaign. Social media platforms have exceptional audience targeting capabilities, but to use it properly you need to know and understand your audience. For example, in the case of the campaign for Barbie’s movie release, segmenting audiences based on demographics like age was essential. The movie was, in fact, aimed at teens and women, not tweens like the doll. Demographics, though, are only one criteria. The campaign created for Priceline illustrates how knowing your audience’s pain points are crucial too. You might know who your target audience is, but you can always get to understand them better. Plus, needs and interests change which can impact your campaign’s approach. In the case of Priceline, a simple survey already revealed key information regarding travelers’ pain points, but you can also use more robust audience research tools like: Depending on your budget, you can incorporate influencer-generated content. According to The Influencer Marketing Factory, 90% of influencer marketing campaigns include paid media. This way, you can add that element of trust and validation which are important to social media users. Another benefit is that you grow your reach. Your ads will grab the attention of the influencer’s followers too. You don’t necessarily need to use the likes of Ewan McGregor or Penny from The Big Bang Theory. In fact, our Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report 2024 found that mega/celebrity influencers are used least often. Only 12.9% of brands plan to use mega influencers in 2024, compared to 44% that plan to use mostly nano-influencers. Influencer Preferences Cost isn’t the only reason. Nano and micro-influencers in some instances have higher engagement rates. This is especially true if you plan on using Instagram or TikTok. Data shared by Captiv8 with EMARKETER reveals that Instagram influencers with fewer than 10,000 followers have the highest engagement rate at 6.23%. On TikTok, the picture looks similar. Here, nano-influencers also have the highest engagement rate, according to Statista’s numbers. Engagement rate of TikTok influencers worldwide What is essential when selecting influencers is that target audiences must align with the influencer’s followers. Ideally, there should also be a link between the influencer’s own interests and that of your product. In the case of Volkswagen’s campaign, the fact that Ewan McGregor is a longtime Volkswagen driver, helps to create that trust and validation that makes this form of marketing so effective. Crafting successful social ad campaigns requires more than just a budget and creativity. By leveraging analytics tools, you can gain profound insights into your target audience, ensuring your content resonates and engages effectively. Prioritizing social-first content tailored to each platform's unique environment can significantly boost your campaign's performance. For example, on TikTok and Instagram videos designed for mobile viewing are a must. And, if your budget allows it, combine your paid social efforts with influencer marketing. It can amplify your reach and credibility, making your social media ads more impactful. Facebook is considered one of the best social media platforms for paid advertising. It has advanced audience targeting features, various ad formats, and allows for different campaign objectives such as awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales. What’s more, Facebook is the most-used social media platform worldwide, offering a large and diverse audience for brands to reach.

Title: From Land Grabbers to Carbon Cowboys: A New Scramble for Community Lands Takes Off
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/land-grabbers-carbon-cowboys/5868860

Full Content:
In a recent interview with the New York Times, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was asked if there were types of projects that he would not invest in to offset his greenhouse gas emissions. “I don’t plant trees,” he replied, adding that planting trees to deal with the climate crisis was complete nonsense. “I mean, are we the science people, or are we the idiots? Which one do we want to be?”[1] Microsoft, the company he built his fortune on and, according to insiders, still actively advises, sees it differently. In June 2024, the tech giant bought 8 million carbon credits from the Timberland Investment Group (TIG), a fund owned by the Brazilian agribusiness lender BTG Pactual.[2] TIG is raising US$1 billion to buy and convert pasture lands to large-scale eucalyptus plantations across the Southern Cone of Latin America.[3] As these trees grow, they draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their roots, trunks and branches. TIG will estimate the amount of carbon removed and then sell it as carbon credits to Microsoft and other corporations. Each carbon credit that Microsoft buys from TIG is supposed to offset one tonne of the emissions Microsoft generates burning fossil fuels. This is one of the main ways that Microsoft and many other companies are planning on getting to “net zero” emissions, while still burning fossil fuels. Microsoft’s deal with TIG, reportedly the largest “carbon dioxide removal credit transaction” in history, is just one of many investments Microsoft is making in tree plantations as a way to offset its emissions.[4] The Dutch agribusiness lender Rabobank is another source of carbon credits for the tech company. It too is acquiring land in Brazil for tree plantations, in this instance with a local agribusiness family with a track record of illegal deforestation and fraud.[5] But most of the carbon credits Rabobank sells to Microsoft are from its programme to plant trees on the lands of small coffee and cacao growers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This programme, called Acorn, uses satellites and a Microsoft digital platform to measure the number and size of shade trees that small farmers plant on their farms and then calculate the carbon they’ve removed from the atmosphere. It then sells the carbon to Microsoft as “carbon credits” for about US$38 a piece, taking a 20% cut for itself and its local partner, and paying farmers what’s left of the proceeds.[6] A big problem with Rabobank’s scheme, identified in an investigation of its project with cacao farmers in Côte d’Ivoire, is that it is vastly overestimating the carbon removed — in this case by 600%![7] What’s more, the Côte d’Ivoire government says Rabobank is likely double dipping as its project overlaps with a World Bank-funded scheme that has already generated and sold carbon credits from trees planted on small cacao farms in the same area. All of this “nonsense”, as Gates calls it, has not stopped an increasing number of corporations, governments and billionaires — not to mention a new industry of climate consultants and carbon brokers — from promoting the idea that emissions from fossil fuels can and should be offset by planting trees or other crops that sequester carbon. Such projects have a chequered history that goes back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but they really only took off after the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, when governments endorsed the notion of offsets and carbon markets as an effective means to get corporations to cut their emissions.[8] Today, most offset projects are in the so-called “voluntary market”, where private companies from the global North manage the certification and sale of carbon credits to corporations that want to show they are taking action to deal with climate change. The projects, largely in the global South, can be for anything from the distribution of clean cook stoves in Malawi to the preservation of rainforests in Indonesia. The premise is that the project either prevents emissions that would have occurred without it, or that it leads to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Cook stoves and rainforest preservation are examples of emissions avoidance. Planting trees, on the other hand, is the most popular form of removal. In a 2024 study, the World Rainforest Movement (WRM) says that the number of tree planting projects for carbon credits has tripled over the past three years.[9] WRM says the surge is partly driven by the large number of high-profile scandals in emissions avoidance schemes, known as “REDD+”.[10] Numerous projects to preserve forests have been withdrawn or suspended from carbon markets after investigations showed they were based on implausible stories about the threat of deforestation or that they caused human rights violations and other harms to local communities. As a result, WRM says corporations are turning their attention to tree planting as a source of “high-integrity” carbon credits. This is now spawning a mad rush to secure lands where trees can be planted. Activists and scientists have been warning for years that schemes to offset carbon emissions by planting trees or other crops would lead to a surge in land grabbing, especially in the global South.[11] These warnings are now proving true. GRAIN combed through the various registries of carbon offset projects to try and get a better sense of this new land grab and how it is unfolding. We identified 279 large-scale tree and crop planting projects for carbon credits that corporations have initiated since 2016 in the global South. They cover over 9.1 million hectares of land — an area roughly the size of Portugal. (See Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset) The deals (view the dataset here) add up to a massive new form of land grabbing that will only increase conflicts and pressures over land that are still simmering from the last global land grab spree that erupted in 2007-8 in the wake of global food and financial crises. They also signify that new sources of money are now flowing into the coffers of companies specialised in taking lands from communities in the South to enrich and serve corporations, mainly in the North. Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset What’s in? Our data covers projects from all the major voluntary offset project registries. These are: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard (GS), Verra (VCS), BioCarbono (BC), Cercarbono (CV) and Plan Vivo (PV). It also includes cases on the website farmlandgrab.org that are not yet found in the registries. The projects in our dataset are limited to projects that: – involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 ha for the purpose of producing carbon credits; – are driven by companies from outside the communities; – were initiated since 2016 and up to 31 March 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and – are located in the global South. The projects involve either 1) the creation of large-scale plantations or 2) contract production with small farmers. But all the projects bind the use of the land to the terms of the project for 20 years or more. What’s not in? REDD+ projects, which aim to avoid deforestation, are not included. Some types of projects that produce carbon credits through tree planting or agriculture on large areas of land are not included either. These are: – projects to manage pasture lands, which affect the access to lands and traditional practices of pastoralists; – projects to restore or create mangroves, where large areas of coastline are taken over for the planting of mangrove trees; and, – projects which generate carbon credits by enrolling farmers to implement agricultural practices that are said to build up carbon in the soils, often called “carbon farming”. These projects are extremely important and can have equally severe impacts on communities, including land grabbing, but they are not covered here to keep the dataset manageable.[12] Our data also does not cover projects located in the global North, such as in New Zealand, Scotland and Australia, where national schemes that endorse tree planting for carbon offsets have led to a displacement in food production and undermined farmers’ access to land.[13] To date, 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by these projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia, which are developing their own industries of carbon project developers. But projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.[14] Many of the projects involve land deals to set up giant eucalyptus, acacia or bamboo plantations. Typically, these are pasture lands or savannahs that were used until now by local communities for grazing livestock or growing food. . . The money that investors plan to capture from these deals is immense. The projects we pulled from the Verra and Gold Standard registries alone will generate 2.5 billion carbon credits (1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2 removed) over their lifetime. With an average price of about US$10 per credit, that adds up to a potential bounty of US$25 billion.[15] While these projects are exclusively set up in rural areas with extremely low emissions per capita, it is quite the opposite when it comes to the companies orchestrating the projects. With the exception of what’s happening in India and China, most carbon projects are led by foreign companies in rich countries with atrocious emissions records — such as the Netherlands, the US, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, France, Germany and the UAE.[16] There is a clear colonial dynamic at work, with companies and big NGOs from the North once again using the lands of communities in the global South for their own agendas and their own benefit. . GRAIN and UChicago Data Science Institute (click here for better resolution) . A good number of actors driving this new wave of land grabs are in fact repeat offenders from the global farmland grab that took off a decade and a half ago. This is especially the case in Africa. (See Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business) There are also several companies from the forestry sector with histories of land grabbing and conflicts with local communities. Much of the vast eucalyptus plantations of Brazilian paper giant Suzano, for example, which is involved in three large-scale carbon plantation projects, have been grabbed from Brazil’s indigenous and traditional peoples.[17] And a non-negligible number of project developers have records of illegal dealings and financial scandal. They include: The money being hustled by these carbon cowboys comes mainly from the world’s most polluting corporations, who are interested in buying carbon credits to greenwash their emissions. At the top of the list of credit buyers are fossil fuel companies (See Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping). But there are also tech giants like Meta and Apple, food companies like Danone and Coca-Cola, and supermarket chains like Mercado Libre and Carrefour. Amazon and the philanthropic arms of its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, are heavily involved, too. Bezos both buys credits and funds the NGOs and companies running the plantations, through initiatives like the AFR100 fund, which aims to plant trees on 100 million hectares in Africa.[23] The same goes for development banks, like FMO of the Netherlands, the US International Development Finance Corporation or the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, which provide cheap loans, political risk insurance and even equity investments to many carbon plantation companies. Box 2: Carbon colonialism On 15 April 2022, a group of about 150 farmers gathered outside the operations of Belgian supermarket Colruyt. Standing behind wheel barrows of soil, the farmers accused the company of “stealing lands” by buying up hundreds of hectares of the country’s scarce farmland, ironically as part of a campaign to buy local. “Each piece of land that Colruyt buys is a piece of land taken away from Belgian family farms,” they said.[24] Far away, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the supermarket chain is also acquiring land, but for decidedly not “local” reasons. In 2021, Colruyt got a 25-year, 10,656 ha concession in Kwango province — about 50 times the size of its Belgian farmlands. It plans to establish tree plantations to offset its emissions on these lands, which are currently used by local people for food crops, and to hire security guards to protect the trees from villagers and their “slash and burn” agriculture.[25] In neighbouring Uganda, the Swedish hamburger chain Max is also buying credits from a carbon plantation project, but with a different approach. Rather than displacing local farmers, it gets them to plant trees on their own lands. Participating farmers sign a contract stating that they will plant and maintain trees, get seedlings and a little training, and submit to periodic checks. In return, they get payments for the carbon credits bought by Max to offset its hamburgers. But when a team of journalists from the Swedish media site Aftonbladet visited the farmers in early 2024 they found a horror show.[26] The farmers said they had planted the trees as they were told, not knowing that these trees were offsetting a corporation’s pollution. Things started off fine, but the trees are fast growing and quickly started taking over their fields, sucking up all the sunlight, nutrients and water. The US$100 a year in payments from carbon credits did not cover the loss of food and income from their crops. Eight years into the project, the Swedish media crew found farmers starving — and some were chopping down the trees despite threats of prison for breach of contract by the project proponent. “I used to be something called a model farmer,” says Samuel Byarugaba, one of the farmers. “People came to me to learn about farming and I was proud to show our farm. We had enough food to feed ourselves and could sell the surplus. Now it’s all disappeared.” Corporations from the financial sector are also starting to get involved — a worrying sign that much more money could be mobilised. Rabobank and BTG Pactual are leading examples of financial players establishing specialised funds to invest in carbon plantations on behalf of pension funds, billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, development banks and other institutional investors. Their investment in carbon plantations dovetails with the landholdings that many of these actors have already amassed through timber and farm land investments.[27] The Renewable Resources Group, for instance, is a US private equity firm whose investors include Goldman Sachs and the Harvard University endowment. It specialises in “monetising” water by buying up land in parts of the world where it can get access to cheap irrigation to produce high value crops for export, like grapes and berries. It has already acquired over 100,000 ha of agricultural lands in parts of Mexico, the US, Chile and Argentina where there are water scarcity issues.[28] Recently it established a “nature-based solutions” division through which it acquired the German-based private equity fund 12Tree. Since 2017, 12Tree has acquired 20,000 ha in Latin America and Africa to establish “regenerative” farms where it plants trees and generates carbon credits.[29] One big difference between earlier land grabs for food production and today’s land grab for carbon offsets is that the carbon deals are “certified”. Verra and Gold Standard, two of the top certifiers, are paid large sums of money to ensure that offset projects are done in consultation with local communities, avoid displacing them and even provide them with some benefits. It’s the kind of system that agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Bank have long claimed would solve the ills of the global farmland grab. Yet, our dataset and the growing number of investigations by academics, media and civil society into projects certified by these companies put the lie to such claims.[30] How could anyone expect that a market premised on acquiring lands from rural and indigenous communities in the global South, for the benefit of corporations in the global North, could amount to anything other than a massive land grab? No benefit-sharing mechanism, often baked into these carbon deals, alters that outcome. Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business The rush for land that followed the food and financial crises of 2007-8 hit Africa hard. Hundreds of communities were displaced from their lands to make way for large-scale industrial farms. Yet, even though many of these farms failed badly, the communities are still struggling to get back their lands.[31] Some culprits in that land rush (and near cousins) are now trying to get lands for carbon plantations. Below are some examples. Gagan Gupta: As President of agribusiness giant Olam International, this Singaporean businessman oversaw the company’s 300,000 ha land deal in Gabon in 2011 to build Africa’s largest oil palm plantation. The operation has been mired in conflicts with communities ever since. Now Gupta is running a UAE-based tree plantation company, Sequoia Plantation, which is in the process of securing 200,000 ha in Togo, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo for large-scale tree plantations with carbon offset components, despite protests from affected communities.[32] Kevin Godlington: This UK businessman orchestrated several failed large-scale land deals in Sierra Leone. One was an oil palm plantation in the District of Port Loko that cleared forest and displaced people from their lands before it went bankrupt. Undeterred, Godlington is now going after the same lands with a new venture listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that claims to have lease rights to 57,000 ha to plant trees for carbon credits, some of which have already been bought by British Petroleum. As with the first round of land deals, no matter how things pan out, Godlington has already pocketed millions of dollars from the scheme.[33] Carter Coleman: This UK businessman built the infamous Kilombero Plantation Limited rice farm on 5,818 ha of contested community lands in the heart of Tanzania’s Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. Despite heavy backing from foreign development banks and investors, it went bankrupt in 2019. Coleman is now back with a new company called Udzungwa Corridor Limited that will generate carbon credits by planting “rare tropical hardwoods” on a 7,500 ha stretch of land leased from local farmers along the Kilombero Nature Reserve.[34] Andrea Tozzi: This Italian businessman, CEO of his family’s company Tozzi Green, acquired 11,000 ha of land in three communes in the Ihorombe region of Madagascar in 2012 and 2018 to grow the biofuel crop jatropha. That project failed, and the company switched to growing maize for animal feed and essential oil crops. All the while the communities have been fighting to get their lands back, which they say they need to graze their cattle and grow food for their families. Tozzi is now trying to save his project by replacing the maize with plantations of acacia and eucalyptus for carbon credits — which communities, especially those in Ambatolahy, are still firmly resisting. [35] Karl Kirchmayer: This Austrian businessman, who spent years buying up 147,000 ha of farmlands in Eastern Europe, now has an African land grab venture, ASC Impact. It is partnering with a Senior Advisor to the President of Uganda and a Dubai businessman close to the royal family to sell 60 million tons of carbon credits to UAE companies from mangrove and tree plantation projects, mainly in Africa. ASC Impact is currently negotiating for 27,000 ha in Ethiopia, 25,000 in Angola and 270,000 in the Republic of the Congo! Frank Timis: This Romanian-Swiss businessman is the founder and majority shareholder of African Agriculture Holdings Inc, a US company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, that took over 25,000 ha of lands from a failed Italian company that local communities in Senegal have been fighting to get back for over a decade. His company is also responsible for the largest land deal in our database — a ridiculous pair of 49-year leases covering 2.2 million ha in Niger, where the company will produce carbon credits by planting pine trees. And while nine million hectares is already too much, things could get much worse. The UN climate negotiations are moving towards establishing an international carbon trading mechanism that would allow heavy polluting country governments and their companies to offset national emissions through deals for carbon projects in other countries, mainly in the global South.[36] If and when this happens, the value of carbon credits could surge, generating even higher demand for land to plant trees. Pressure is also coming from efforts to establish markets for biodiversity offsets, which will trigger a feeding frenzy among investors eager to make a buck from the territories of small farmers, indigenous peoples and pastoralists.[37] The idea that planting trees or other means of generating carbon credits can compensate for fossil fuels emissions is a dangerous distraction, incompatible with the real cuts to emissions that are required to deal with the climate crisis.[38] Consider, for instance, that even if the dubious emission removal estimates of the 279 projects in our dataset were true, they would only amount to 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year– not nearly enough to even cover last year’s 90 million tonne increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.[39] Social movements and organisations need to be relentless in exposing these contradictions, harms and frauds. We also need to get more information to the communities on the ground. They are often confused by what the project proponents tell them and not exposed about what other communities have experienced. They are almost never informed about how the projects are designed to enable big corporations to keep polluting and how this pollution is connected to the terrible impacts they are suffering from climate change. The hype about the money to be made, under the misnomer of benefit sharing, can create divisions within communities and draw some families into signing contracts they may soon regret. As all these carbon projects are premised on formal land ownership, they can also undermine community systems of land management. There are already cases where communities have faced violence and intimidation for resisting carbon offset projects and this is only going to escalate. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to share information and experiences about the carbon grabs – locally, nationally, regionally and internationally — so we can put a stop to them. The double threat to communities – both from climate change itself and from these criminal solutions to it — should not be allowed to play out. Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping In September 2023, the oil company Shell shocked carbon markets when it abruptly cancelled plans to plant trees on 12 million hectares of land by 2030 – an area three times the size of its home country, the Netherlands.[40] There wasn’t much to celebrate, however, as the company also scrapped plans to reduce oil production.[41]It’s not clear if Shell was backing out entirely from the carbon offset industry, either. Shell still owns a controlling stake in a Dutch biodiesel company seeking to generate carbon credits by planting pongamia on 120,000 ha in Paraguay. Shell’s European cohorts have not yet lost their enthusiasm for carbon plantations. Italy’s Eni has a biofuel venture pursuing carbon credits in Kenya contracting farmers to grow croton plants on an initial 40,000 ha. British Petroleum (BP) paid Canada’s Carbon Done Right US$2.5 million earlier this year for carbon credits from a 57,000 ha tree plantation project the company is pursuing in Sierra Leone. And the French oil company TotalEnergies has a massive 38,000 ha acacia plantation project to offset its emissions in the Republic of the Congo. Investigations into all three projects point to severe impacts on local farmers.[42] Two of Japan’s top energy firms are also deep into carbon offset plantations. Marubeni has a 31,000 ha pine and eucalyptus plantation project in Angola with an Argentinian businessman.[43] Mitsui, through its Australian subsidiary New Forests, is erecting tree plantations for carbon credits on leased farmlands in northern Tasmania and, through its African Forestry Impact Platform, it recently acquired Green Resources AS, “a Norwegian plantation forestry and carbon credit company notorious for its history of land grabbing, human rights violations, and environmental destruction across Uganda, Mozambique, and Tanzania”.[44] * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: What fueled this week’s record-breaking stock rally | CNN Business

Time Published: 2024-09-27T16:31:21Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The stock market is racking up record highs again. Investors are wasting no time moving into riskier assets from bitcoin to tech stocks after last week’s long-awaited rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Last week, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to new highs after the Fed said it is cutting interest rates by half a point, marking a pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle that brought rates to a 23-year high. CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is at a “greed” reading. Strong economic data this week has kept the party going. The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Related article A dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more Fresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year. “What seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession. Elsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy. Investors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July’s dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed’s focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday’s report will likely offer clues for the Fed’s next move at its November policy meeting. Related article Americans are fretting over the job market Meanwhile, tech shares continued to gain this week on rate cut optimism and strong earnings from Micron. Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%. In China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates. Oil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil. Gold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy’s health. Bitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin. As stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.

Title: The Secret Frameworks (Mental Models) Behind the Success of 10 Famous Entrepreneurs
URL: https://www.jeffbullas.com/mental-models/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:14:36Z
Full Content:
jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of “taking charge” and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book “Lean In.” Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you’re 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is “radical transparency” within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray’s mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn’t as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you’re older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, “What can we do to make our customers happier?”, you ask, “What are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?” then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don’t need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let’s leave the comparison there. Finding or creating “Simplicity” in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So…simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. “I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn’t have the time.” To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is “scaling economics” at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn’t have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started “Threads”. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator’s dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world’s richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn’t get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It’s not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980’s (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. “Compounding” is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn’t stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of “People over process” Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: © Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.
