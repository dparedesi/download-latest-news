UPDATED 21:32 EST / NOVEMBER 13 2025 by Mike Wheatley Exowatt Inc., a solar-thermal energy startup backed by OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and other high-profile investors, wants to solve the artificial intelligence energy crisis with millions of hot rocks. To do that, it has raised millions of dollars – $50 million in fact, led by MVP Ventures and 8090 Industries. Today’s round also saw participation from other investors that included Atomic, Bridge Bay Ventures, the Florida Opportunity Fund, DeepWork Capital, Dragon Global and Massive VC. The round is described as an extension of the company’s original $70 million Series A, which closed in April. Altman’s involvement stems from its original seed funding round in 2024, where he was one of several angel investors. Exowatt says its thermal battery technology, powered by solar energy, has the potential to provide enormous AI data centers with electricity at rates as low as one cent per kilowatt-hour, which would make it around 90% cheaper than the average U.S. grid rate. If it can do this, it’s sure to be of enormous interest to AI data center operators such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC and Oracle Corp., which are all desperate for energy as they scramble to build out their infrastructure. With data centers springing up across the country, operators are desperate to secure a power source for them, but grid queues in some locations can stretch for years. As a result, data centers are being built faster than power suppliers can keep up. Exowatt is pitching a somewhat unconventional solution to this looming crisis, with millions of superheated rocks held in storage that can provide energy around the clock. The company’s solar-thermal energy works by using concentrated solar power to heat up special ceramic or rock-based materials to temperatures as high as 1,200°C when the sun is shining. These materials act as thermal batteries, releasing the stored heat to power steam turbines that generate electricity, even when the sun goes down. It transforms rocks into a power source, and once the system is set up and in place, it can provide electricity much more cheaply than through conventional means, which typically cost from eight to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. The math is compelling, especially when considering the future energy requirements of data centers. Today, these facilities consume about 1% of the world’s electricity, but the demand for AI is forecast to push that up to around 3% to 4% by the end of the decade, Exowatt says. Exowatt’s challenge is that it needs to gear up its manufacturing operation to produce 1 million thermal battery units per year. It said this target is necessary for it to deliver on its penny-per-kWh promise through economies of scale. Doing so is easier said than done, though, considering that Exowatt has only built a handful of batteries so far. Still, it has gotten enough backing to at least attempt to reach that goal. Altman is one of a number of voices in the AI industry who has been quite vocal about the need to solve the looming power bottleneck, and many of his rivals are pursuing different ideas. For instance, Meta Platforms Inc. is exploring nuclear energy, particularly the use of small modular reactors that can be located close to its data centers. Google LLC has also invested in a number of nuclear energy startups, as has Amazon. Aside from exploiting more fossil fuels, renewable energy is really the main alternative to nuclear power, and it is certainly popular with environmentalists, but the problem is that solar- and wind-farms require affordable and reliable storage solutions to be able to meet AI’s power demands 24/7. Most existing energy storage systems use lithium-ion batteries, but they’re very expensive and there are concerns around the availability of the rare earth elements needed in their construction. Thermal storage provides some advantages. The rocks and ceramics are much cheaper, and they’re also more durable. Exowatt says its rock-based storage systems can maintain heat for about five days and they never degrade – unlike lithium-ion batteries, which gradually lose capacity over the endless charging cycles they have to endure. That said, there are questions about the real-world performance of Exowatt’s system, which has never been attempted at such a large scale, as well as grid integration. Previous solar-thermal energy projects have suffered with efficiency problems and unforeseen maintenance costs, and Exowatt will have to show that its batteries can deliver on its cost promises and operate in diverse climates. That may be why the company hasn’t yet announced a specific timeline for deploying its technology, nor any major customers. Even so, Exowatt has the capital, the demand and timing on its side, and if it can scale up its technology to achieve its ambitious price targets, it might just become the rock on which the future AI industry is built.

Title: ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry deregisters Scion hedge fund amid bets against AI titans

Michael Burry, the investor whose successful bets against the US housing market in 2008 were recounted in the movie “The Big Short,” is closing his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management. In a letter to investors dated Oct. 27, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Burry said he would liquidate the funds and return capital, “but for a small audit/tax holdback” by the end of the year. A person directly familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the letter. “My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets,” Burry said in the letter. Burry could not be immediately reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s database showed Scion’s registration status as “terminated” as of Nov. 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state. Investment funds that manage more than $100 million of capital are required to register with the SEC. Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth. In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, “On to much better things Nov 25th.” Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burry, who was famously featured in the book and movie ‘The Big Short’, has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments. In his post on X, Burry said he spent about $9.2 million buying up about 50,000 put options on Palantir, saying that the options would allow him to sell the stock at $50 apiece in 2027. The put options convey the right to sell shares at a set price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view. Palantir’s shares were trading at $178.29 on Thursday, giving the company a market value of $422.36 billion. So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD Last month, Burry posted an image of his character from ‘The Big Short’ movie and warned of bubbles, saying that, “Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.” “Burry’s decision feels less like ‘calling it quits’ and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Burry, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated. AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of the S&P 500 index’s returns since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, JPMorgan Asset Management wrote in September. “Don’t count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital,” said Schneller. The investor’s short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Big Short,” and its film adaptation. His profile on X, titled “Cassandra Unchained,” is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe. Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation. Burry’s Scion ended last year with shares in American Coastal, Bruker, Canada Goose, HCA Healthcare, Magnera, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health and VF Corp, but the firm ended those bets earlier this year. During the quarter ended June 30, Burry’s Scion Asset Management was more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs. Burry, who launched Scion Asset Management in 2013, joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors. Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India’s Adani Group and electric-truck maker Nikola. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company’s bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor’s bitcoin holding company Strategy. Chanos has argued that Strategy’s valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor. Advertisement

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And we’ve found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to our forecasting approach.Iteration by iteration, my skepticism has turned to light distrust, and then into actually getting value out of our company forecasts. Like most AI companies, we draw from improvements against our LLM-agent benchmarks, Deep Research Bench and Bench to the Future.But at the end of the day, to evaluate it, I think it’s best to follow Charlie Munger’s advice: try to disprove what Stockfisher says. Now, even after an hour of carefully reading through a stock, I generally can’t find any major flaws, and I hear the same from other serious investors.And, since it’s software, not human analysis, we applied it at scale. We have long-term forecasts for revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500.We do a Buffett-style intrinsic valuation, that doesn’t take the stock price into account.

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Treasuries

Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:00:00Z

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3,178.42, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$142.95, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock. A DAT’s share price reflects not just the value of its crypto treasury but also investor sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Advisors should review three things: Advisors can then reframe client enthusiasm around fundamentals. Is the goal diversified exposure or speculation on a premium? That distinction determines whether a DAT belongs anywhere near a client’s portfolio. Q: What should advisors be ready to explain when clients compare DATs to spot ETFs? A: This will be the most common question. The answer is that spot ETFs hold the digital asset directly, trade close to net asset value, and operate under clear regulation. DATs, on the other hand, are companies using corporate balance sheets to hold those same assets and sometimes using debt to do it.

Title: How To Love The Planet And Make Money

ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. The greenies are on the run. So how is it that the low-carbon portfolio run by Xavier Chollet is just now doing so well? Chollet oversees the Clean Energy Transition strategy for Pictet, one of the larger Swiss money managers. It’s a tough assignment. Over the past decade, alternative-energy stocks have fallen well behind the S&P 500 index. But this year they turned a corner. So far this year Chollet’s $5.5 billion collection of stocks is up 26%, 9 points ahead of the S&P 500. There are two elements to the Pictet portfolio’s survival. One is that Chollet is permitted to define “transition” in a very expansive fashion. He has only 24% of the money in renewables like solar and wind. The rest tracks other themes, like energy efficiency in semiconductors, energy efficiency in buildings and products that make industrial processes either more efficient or cleaner. The other safety valve is that Chollet shuns the most speculative ventures of the green-energy genre. He says, “We want to invest in companies that are profitable and don’t need subsidies.” That rules out a lot of obvious candidates for a carbon-shunning fund. Green-hydrogen companies, for example, have a way of losing money even when collecting government handouts. He won’t touch them. So it was that during the insane run-up in solar and hydrogen stocks during 2020, Chollet lagged other alternative-energy managers. The next year solar and hydrogen crashed, but the Pictet fund was up. Over the long term, his looser notion of investing in an energy transition, and his favoritism toward somewhat conservative stocks, has given him staying power. Chollet, 51, grew up in Geneva and joined the Pictet home office there immediately after getting business degrees from the University of Lausanne and the University of Miami. He has been on the clean-energy strategy since 2011. Most of his clients are institutional or individual investors in Europe; recently, for the U.S. market, his employer opened the Pictet Cleaner Planet ETF. Chollet’s team is responsible for half the stock picks now in the U.S. fund. Chollet speaks with a French accent but his portfolio has an American slant, with 74% of assets in U.S. companies. His biggest bet, with not quite 5% of assets, is on Nextracker, which makes equipment to aim solar arrays at the sun. It’s in the black. Its share price has more than doubled this year. This, even though 2025 would seem to be a bad year to bet on solar. To the horror of environmentalists, Bill Gates, just four years after penning a book on the climate catastrophe, is now opining that the money spent fighting carbon might better be spent fighting poverty and disease. And then there are the politicians spouting the slogan “Drill, baby, drill.” With a fossil-fuel lover in the White House, how can renewable energy be doing so well now? Because investors, anticipating the worst, were pleasantly surprised this year. That allegedly beautiful tax bill that President Trump pushed through didn’t kill alternative-energy subsidies. It mostly threw on some deadlines and some buy-American provisions. Says Chollet: “The rules of the game for the current administration in solar in the U.S. are way better than everyone expected.” What would happen in a world without rules—with, that is, neither mandates nor subsidies? Wouldn’t solar and wind be dead? Not at all, says Chollet: “Close to 90% of the new power additions in the world come from renewable and storage, not from nuclear or gas or coal, because it makes economic sense.” He pulls out a chart of electricity generation costs in the U.S. With fuel and capital costs combined, a kilowatt-hour of onshore wind costs 5 cents, solar 6 cents, natural gas 10 cents. He concedes that the numbers for the two renewables would be higher if you included the cost of batteries to supply juice during doldrums and darkness. But even with batteries attached, he says, renewables are cheaper than fossil-fuel or nuclear power generation. The costs he cites, importantly, are before any benefit from government subsidies. Put costs aside for a moment, Chollet goes on. Think about availability. Artificial intelligence research by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet will draw lots of power, sometimes a gigawatt or more per installation. (A gigawatt would power a large city.) Those AI fanatics want their energy now, not later. The delivery time for a solar plant in the U.S. is a year, Chollet says, for an onshore wind farm two years. A gas-powered plant needs turbines for which the wait, including installation time, is four years. What about nuclear? Even if cookie-cutter plants (“small modular reactors”) catch on, it will take a utility ten years for the permits and the construction, he says. Trump doesn’t like renewables and he doesn’t like solar panels that come from China. But he also doesn’t want China getting ahead in AI, Chollet says. So Trump won’t get in the way of the solar that will power data centers. Chollet has stakes in solar companies (like Nextracker) that supply utility-scale projects. He avoids companies (like Sunrun) doing residential solar. Better still, Chollet’s definition of what is meant by “clean energy” allows him to get another piece of the hot data center business. So far Nvidia has been the conspicuous beneficiary of AI spending, but Chollet sees the arc of technology bending toward two other semiconductor companies. He has stakes in Broadcom and Marvell Technology, which make “application specific integrated circuits.” ASICs, while less flexible than Nvidia’s graphics processing units, are less gluttonous with electricity consumption. Chollet is in semiconductors for the growth; he’s allowed to be in them on the theory that specialized chips will do less damage to the planet than the usual kind. High-growth stocks tend to be both expensive and risky. Broadcom trades at 93 times trailing earnings. In Chollet’s eyes its growth makes it affordable at 29 times the earnings he expects two years from now. As for risk, that is dampened by the boring stocks in the Pictet lineup, such as Xcel Energy, a midwestern utility; Linde, which sells gases to make industrial processes more efficient, and TopBuild, which sells garage doors and asphalt shingles. Wait. What’s green about garage doors? TopBuild also sells insulation. By reducing heating and cooling loads, insulation preserves the planet. Technology is uncertain. The hot and cold of carbon politics is uncertain. But there is something to be said for accepting risk while moderating it. In 2020 the iShares Clean Energy ETF delivered a 141% return, Morningstar reports, leaving Chollet’s stocks far behind with only 54%. But in 2021 the iShares fund lost money while Chollet’s portfolio gained 12%. Over the past decade (through September) iShares has delivered a 7% annual return in clean energy, Pictet 12%. For Chollet, adopting a light shade of green has been a good strategy.

Title: Steam Frame vs. Quest 3 Specs: Better PC Streaming, Power & Hackability

VR games and user comfort are still big question marks Want to know how Valve’s newly announced Steam Frame standalone headset stacks up against the competition? Read on to find out. Steam Frame is a lot like Steam Deck; it can play pretty much all of Steam’s game library out of the box, which includes flatscreen content based on x86 architecture—basically everything on Steam—and also now PC VR games. That means you can download modern flatscreen and VR titles and play on-the-go, no wires or PC needed. More on that below. Primarily though, Valve says it’s designed to stream PC VR games wirelessly, which it does through a Wi-Fi 6E dongle you plug straight into your computer (or the newly announced Steam Machine). Our hands-on with Frame’s streaming quality was promising. Quest 3 can stream PC VR games too, albeit in a roundabout way that requires you to stream through your home’s Wi-Fi router, which can cause some bottlenecks since the video stream needs to go from your PC, to the router, and then to the headset. Valve’s solution cuts out that middle man. The big difference though is in power and game compatibility. While both Quest 3 and Frame feature ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon processors (Frame’s is more powerful), only Frame can natively play x86 Windows and Linux content thanks to its built-in compatibility layer. Quest 3 can only natively play games compiled for ARM—albeit from a massive library, all of which are certified to work on the headset. The same can’t be said about Frame just yet. Valve is distributing Frame dev kits ahead of Frame’s 2026 launch to make sure PC VR studios can optimize; we expect the company to also have some sort of badging system similar to Steam Deck too so users know what works great, okay, or not at all. That said, Valve isn’t stopping you from trying to download and play anything (x86) available on Steam. Another big difference is the hackability of Frame. The headset natively run SteamOS, although you can technically install any OS on it you want (or realistically can), since it’s an open platform and gives you direct access to Linux for all of your hacking needs. That’s something you definitely can’t do with Quest’s Horizon OS due to its locked bootloader (i.e. no root access). Valve is so confident in Frame’s SteamOS that the company tells Road to VR the operating system “would be great for other [VR] devices.” What’s more, Frame also has a user accessible expansion gen4 PCIe port, which supports up to two 2.5 Gbps cameras… or anything you can think of. Additionally, Frame sports an microSD card slot for up to 2TB of additional storage—both of them clear wins for makers and gamers looking to expand Frame out of the box. Steam Frame could also promise better comfort over Quest 3, although the jury is still out. The headset features a front ‘core’ component, including the displays and optics, which weighs in at only 190g, putting the bulk of the remaining 245g in the total 435g package to the headstrap, which features a rear-mounted battery (21.6 Wh lithium ion). The default config shipped in the box (above) notably lacks a top strap though, which Valve is selling as an optional add-on later to go along with Knuckles-style controller straps (below). Where things even out somewhat (at least on paper) is the headsets’ displays. Quest 3 serves up a 2,064 × 2,208 per-eye LCD, while Frame has a 2,160 × 2,160 per-eye LCD. Both are clocked up to a refresh rate of 72-120Hz, although Frame is said to allow up to 144Hz in an experimental mode. Still, Frame does let down in the passthrough department; it only has monochrome passthrough, harkening back to the Quest 2 days—an odd (and probably cost-saving) decision by the company. On the other hand, Quest 3 offers a full-color passthrough, which is undoubtedly the better way to not only checking on your surroundings occasionally while immersed in VR, but also play games on a giant screen in your living room. It’s undoubtedly early days, but Frame could be a very compelling package over Quest 3. Besides the raw spec sheet (seen below), a big missing piece in the equation though is still price and release date. Valve says we’re sure to learn more on that front in “early 2026,” which they say could come somewhere below Valve Index, which is priced ‘all-in’ at $1,000. In the meantime, you can read our deep dive review of Quest 3 and our hands-on with Steam Frame for more info. Valve Unveils Steam Frame VR headset to Make Your Entire Steam Library Portable: Valve shows off Steam Frame, the standalone headset that can stream and natively play your entire Steam library—with only a few caveats right now. Hands-on: Steam Frame Reveals Valve’s Modern Vision for VR and Growing Hardware Ambitions: We go hands-on with Valve’s latest and greatest VR headset yet. Steam Frame’s Price Hasn’t Been Locked in, But Valve Expects it to be ‘cheaper than Index’: No price or release date yet, but Valve implies Steam Frame will be cheaper than $1,000 for the full Index kit. Valve Says No New First-party VR Game is in Development: Valve launched Half-Life: Alyx (2020) a few months after releasing Index, but no such luck for first-party content on Steam Frame. Valve is Open to Bringing SteamOS to Third-party VR Headsets: Steam Frame is the first VR headset to run SteamOS, but it may not be the last. Valve Plans to Offer Steam Frame Dev Kits to VR Developers: Steam Frame isn’t here yet; Valve says it needs more time with developers first so they can optimize their PC VR games.

Steam Frame vs. Valve Index Specs: Wireless VR Gameplay That’s Generations Ahead : Valve Index used to be the go-to PC VR headset, but the times have changed. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. The first ever mainstream PC on face (not running a joke of a restricted tablet OS like everyone else) and it's not a proper "spatial computer" because it has monochromatic cameras and I assume no hand/finger tracking. I assume not regarding the finger tracking, unless it is compatible with those lighthouse things required to track the index. Your "Hands On" article states that the Steam Frame has a noticesble "screen-door" effect, whereas the Quest 3 does not. This makes the Steam Frame an unacceptable alternative. This is going to depend on the price, but the specs don't look great, disappointing you might say. At least I'm not kicking my self having bought a quest 3 not even two weeks ago… I was incredibly surprised by that, too Let's hope that this can be somewhat fixed/reduced between the current early development units and the Steam Frame Valve will actually ship to customers. After all the hype and waiting LMAO.. what a complete disappointment! Not just LCD but CRAP LCD (no local dimming and years old resolution). It's like it's half good in the new stuff it does, but it's stuck on an really crappy sub quest 3 (and I'm no fan of quest or any LCD in VR) with mono pass through and a higher price. It's weird and not very desirable. Most core PC VR users are saying NO and will go to high end microOLED (word on the streets already) and most noobs/casuals are like 'why should I upgrade from my quest?'.. .the rest are on PSVR2 on PS5 AND PC (like me) saying "this is worse much much worse than PSVR2 with 200 nits vs 100 nits, HDR, better controllers, Haptics, display port, OLED!!!!!! wider FOV… 3 years available and only around $400… Who exactly is going to buy Frame for anything other than just above or just under quest 3 price? Only good thing is it's not META. I would have considered and compromised with all the downsides if the FOV was better than index. Some people hyped this too much and expectations were too high I didn't know Vive was going to release a new headset and I found it pretty neat. If it's Quest 3 price I would definetelly but this instead of Quest. It has Eye Tracking, looks way more confortable and has this thingy to make the connection with wireless PCVR way smoother. I really don't care about passthrough, to be honest, I think Meta messed up spending money with Mixed Reality on a VR headset, It's terrible and does not make much sense to me. There is an astonishing difference between the reception from VR enthusiasts vs a general technical audience. While here the overall reaction is mostly negative due to the underwhelming specs, on sites like Ars Technica with a very technical audience there are mostly positive reactions from people saying they have been interested in VR, but didn't want a Meta based HMD or anything involving a lot of hassle. They see the Steam Frame as the easy plug'n'play solution they have been looking for. These people haven't had years long discussions about LCD vs. OLED or minimal pixel count, they were just looking for a wireless Steam version of a PSVR2, something you connect to a PC and it just works. And this is probably where the Frame with its moderate resolution, supported by eye tracking foveated streaming/rendering will actually rule, allowing for near tethered low latency and high quality without having to deal with Wifi configurations, and running PCVR decently even from mid-range GPUs not costing thousands. So yeah, expectations have a very big influence on the reception. Overall, I kinda agree with you. But maybe tone it down a little, there's still a few good points. Dedicated wireless streaming dongle with foveated streaming could be nice. Passthrough is not a big loss. The Snap S8G3 is significantly more powerful than the XR2, at least on paper. OS could be an important factor, and steamOS on deck is pretty great at what it does.. Also when comparing display you're ignoring the lenses. You can't do OLED plus pancake lenses, because they absorb to much light. Which is why psvr2 uses fresnel, with their small sweet spot and lower fov. If you want led with pancake, it's micro led. Which the vision pro, Samsung, and a few other premium headset do. But for an even higher price ! LCD is the only choice if you want pancake lenses while keeping price under 1k. I'd say it has a few significant advantages over Q3, even if nothing groundbreaking. But that's only if it retails at similar price, and I don't think it will. TL;DR: there are a number of things the Frame does great, and the performance could be quite good, but that depends a lot on what level of magic Valve pulled of regarding emulation speed and thermal controls for a SoC not designed for VR. The Frame lenses seem to be excellent, with basically no glare. The combination of foveated streaming and a dedicated 6GHz WiFi dongle also seams to offer an unprecedented solution that closely matches tethered HMDs in latency and clarity, at least according to Linus from Linus Tech Tips, a high frame rate, low latency fanatic. The SD8 Gen 3 can be significantly faster than the XR2 Gen 2. The XR2 uses only performance and efficiency cores, which run between 1.6GHz and 2.05GHz in Quest 3, while the matching SD8 Gen 2 runs them at 2.8GHz. And the SD8 Gen 3 features an additional, much larger and faster X4 high performance core at 3.3GHz, with the performance cores running at 3.15GHz. So its peak performance is much higher than any XR2, which is configured for permanent high load, clocking the cores lower to avoid thermal throttling. Qualcomm emphasized extra GPU performance with the XR2 Gen 3, adding about 150% compared to Quest 2, and Meta underclocks the CPU part to where you only see a 14% CPU improvement over Quest 2 in graphics heavy apps on (according to slides Meta showed during the Quest 3 introduction). This may be very important esp. for running (emulated or ported) PCVR games that are often physics heavy, expecting a much faster CPU than is available on mobile. The GPU performance may be the lesser issue here, as translation from DX8-12 to Vulkan is very efficient, and ETFR will further reduce the rendering load, but not the physics calulation load. The big problem is that the SD8 Gen 3 is a smartphone chip, targeting short high load bursts followed by longer idle times, where the phone would only use the efficiency or even just the extra low power cores, dramatically reducing power draw and heat production. SteamOS on the Steam Deck is basically the wet dream of mobile power optimization and power consumption, so there is a decent chance that Valve manages to pull off using a smartphone SoC in a VR HMD, when everybody else sticks to Qualcomm's XR2 line optimized for constant load without throttling, at the cost of lower clocks/performance. A chip doesnt get optimised for high burst or constant throughput. A chip is simply made to execute generic code instructions as fast as possible. What defines that burst behaviour is the insufficient cooling on mobile phones. On equal footing Gen 3 annihilates XR2 Given the amount of detail they have given to cooling (gamersnexus video) I have no doubt that it will be capable of driving Gen 3 on max constantly A core by itself may not be optimized for high burst alone, but a SoC most certainly is. And in reality the reason why SoC now have several types of cores is exactly because they are optimized for either burst, sustained or low power performance. The SD8 Gen 2 had a 1/2/2/4 high performance/performance/efficiency/low power core configuration, while the equivalent XR2 Gen 2 had a 0/2/3/0 configuration. There is no way you can drive all cores of the SD8 Gen 2 at the same time, the TDP simply doesn't allow it, and you cannot simply overclock and cool it with liquid nitrogen. The XR2 Gen 2 is also produced on an older Samsung process that is sufficient for its significantly lower core clocks and reduces the price. So in effect you can run the highest performance level possible on the XR2 Gen 2 with "normal" cooling for a longer time. You cannot do the same with the SD8 Gen 2, where this would quickly lead to thermal throttling, but that is by design, as the high performance core is only used for burst activities. And the main reason for this is to allow the whole phone to be able to return to a low power state faster, which more than compensates the higher power draw of the burst core. I'd expect Valve to have come up with decent cooling for the SD8 Gen 3, and easily outperform the Meta headsets that underclock the CPU. But there is only so much you can do in a 195g core module, not allowing for some crazy overclocker cooling setup. So it is very unlikely that even Valve will be able to run the X4 high performance core at its max speed for more than a few minutes, let alone in parallel to the performance and efficiency cores. The SD8 Gen 3 with a 17W peak/8W sustained power TDP is simply not designed for that. They can easily drive it at 17W sustained, they arent limited to super small form factor of smartphone that also carries battery and touch screen and needs to be water proof. 17W isnt even difficult to handle. TL;DR: No, they cannot easily drive it at 17W sustained. They don't even try, because that would be stupid, and the Gamers Nexus video explains why. The Steam Frame is not a PC where you can add lots of airflow and cooling, and phone SoC work very differently from PC CPUs that are mostly designed for sustained load. Apple uses similar core configs on both Macs and iPhones, but Qualcomm relies a lot on alternating between burst and low power cores. And the rules for max power are pretty universal. On high core CPUs like Xeon the per-core clock goes down a lot when you run all of them in parallel. People using old Xeons in gaming rigs regularly disable extra cores to allow the remaining ones as higher speed, because many games need more single core peak than multicore performance, possible as the disabled cores no longer count against the total TDP. And while PCs and consoles can just throw more power at things to improve performance (up to the chips limits), in mobile devices everything is about saving power, and running anything at max TDP for a longer time is just plain stupid, as relative performance gains decrease with higher power, while it kills battery life. With a Steam Frame 21.6Wh battery, just the SoC alone would burn through this in about an hour at max TDP, even without the RAM or very bright displays and other parts eating more power. If we assume that Valve is aiming for at least 90min play time, the whole system mustn't draw more than 14.4W sustained. The SD8 Gen 3 is designed for a sustained TDP of 8W, with short bursts. And in the Games Nexus Steam Frame engineering deep dive the Valve engineers clearly state that to even test running the SD8 Gen 3's max thermal dispensation, they had to custom build a water cooled solution to drive it without throttling. Through clever PCB layout Valve was able to add a second heat pipe for improved cooling, but that still doesn't allow them to drive it at twice the designed sustained TDP, which would required for max load. They did a lot of clever things like very precisely measuring the separate power rails for the different SoC clusters to learn where exactly the power went, plus tons of thermal sensors all over the device, but this is to find the optimal performance/power balance, not to magically allow them to drive the SoC way beyond its physical capabilities. Instead they will be able to configure a game specific optimal power distribution. One game with sustained load might only use performance cores with the GPU fully enabled, another turn-based game with regular compute bursts instead use the high performance core for computation, increasing heat, but then allowing the whole SoC to cool down afterwards. It does not mean running the SoC at full power, it means running the SoC at optimal power/performance ratio. Pretty much what made up "Valve magic" on the Steam Deck. And they aren't even maxing out the cooling capacity of those two heat pipes because this would require a very large and noisy fan, with the Valve engineers saying they are aiming for a "sweet spot" for efficient cooling vs. noise generation. Just like on the Steam Deck, TDP will be user adjustable, so you will be probably be able to drive the fans at max speed and the SoC at 17W, but that will nonetheless quickly lead to thermal throttling. And they state that a lot of components like the Wifi chips and displays are thermal sensitive, so their performance will suffer when driving the Frame outside of the recommended TDP. Not to mention that wearing a hot HMD would suck. Just like on the Steam Deck, the user adjustable TDP will be most useful for lowering power consumption for specific apps to allow for longer battery run times. And Valve has invested a lot of effort to run the SD8 Gen 3 at the highest performance that makes sense for different games while keeping a lot of other factors like battery and comfort in mind. Not the highest performance that it could technically achieve (with a water cooler). If you didn't get that from the Gamers Nexus video, I'd suggest watching it again. Agree on the analysis, but I think that more than the simple specs, it will be the ecosystems that will make a difference… Up to a point: Quest3 runs its own application PLUS Steam games on a PC. Steam frames runs Steam games smoother and have better PCVR streaming, but I suspect running Steam games standalone is going to be a very low end option… Nice AI sheet. :D Quest 3 528GB (WTF) and 1TB variants? Give me them please!

How can we accurately decompose a temporal irregular tensor along while incorporating a related knowledge graph tensor in both offline and online streaming settings? PARAFAC2 decomposition is widely applied to the analysis of irregular tensors consisting of matrices with varying row sizes. In both offline and online streaming scenarios, existing PARAFAC2 methods primarily focus on capturing dynamic features that evolve over time, since data irregularities often arise from temporal variations. However, these methods tend to overlook static features, such as knowledge-based information, which remain unchanged over time. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF (Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization) and OKG-CTF (Online Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), two coupled tensor factorization methods designed to effectively capture both dynamic and static features within an irregular tensor in offline and online streaming settings, respectively. To integrate knowledge graph tensors as static features, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF couple an irregular temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing a common axis. Additionally, both methods employ relational regularization to preserve the structural dependencies among the factor matrices of the knowledge graph tensor. To further enhance convergence speed, we utilize momentum-based update strategies for factor matrices. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KG-CTF reduces error rates by up to 1.64× compared to existing PARAFAC2 methods. Furthermore, OKG-CTF achieves up to 5.7× faster running times compared to existing streaming approaches for each newly arriving tensor.

Given a temporal irregular tensor and a knowledge graph tensor, how can we accurately decompose these tensors to derive meaningful latent factors? Many real-world datasets are represented as irregular tensors such as stock data, traffic data, and music data. An irregular tensor consists of matrices with varying row sizes, while the column sizes remain fixed. For example, in stock data, each matrix corresponds to a specific stock, where the number of rows varies based on different time periods, but the columns represent common stock features such as opening price, closing price, and trading volume. Large-scale factual information is effectively organized into a knowledge graph, which represents information through entities and the relationships between them. A knowledge graph is structured as a graph-based database that represents information in the form of triples (es, r, eo), where the subject (head) entity es is connected to the object (tail) entity eo through the relation r. A knowledge graph can be modeled as a third-order binary array in tensor form, where each entry represents a triplet, with a value of 1 indicating a known fact and 0 representing an unknown or missing fact. Various tensor decomposition methods for knowledge graphs [1–5] have been developed to capture hidden relational patterns and improve the accuracy of missing information prediction. Many tensor decomposition methods [6–12] have been proposed to extract patterns from high-dimensional data. Recently, there has been much attention on PARAFAC2 decomposition [13–17] in order to analyze irregular tensors. These approaches [14,16] primarily employ the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, incorporating various optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency of updates. However, many existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods have significant limitations. First, they emphasize modeling temporal dynamic features (e.g., daily stock prices and trading volumes), which leads to neglecting static features (e.g., a company’s sector) that remain unchanged over time in the tensor. Both dynamic and static features are equally crucial for the accurate modeling of factor matrices. Second, incorporating static features into the existing PARAFAC2 decomposition method [14,18] often introduces a significant bias toward the temporal features, ultimately failing to explicitly model auxiliary information. TASTE [19] incorporates both dynamic and static features through coupled matrix and tensor factorization; however, it fails to represent static features as high-dimensional data, potentially resulting in information loss. Third, while existing PARAFAC2-based decomposition methods [15,20] introduce additional regularization terms to incorporate information from multiple sources, these terms often hinder convergence during the learning process. Therefore, the major challenges to be addressed are: 1) how to effectively integrate dynamic and static information in irregular tensors, 2) how to accurately capture patterns within static information, and 3) how to develop an update rule for stable convergence. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, two accurate coupled tensor factorization methods to integrate dynamic and static information in irregular tensors by leveraging knowledge graphs. KG-CTF runs in an offline setting, while OKG-CTF is designed for an online streaming setting. The main ideas of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF are as follows: 1) integrate a temporal irregular tensor with a knowledge graph tensor to model both dynamic and static features, 2) introduce an effective regularization that captures the relationships within the factor matrices of the knowledge graph, and then 3) ensure stable and fast convergence of the complex loss function through a momentum-based ALS update mechanism. Furthermore, in an online streaming setting, OKG-CTF efficiently deals with newly incoming tensors by avoiding direct computations on the entire tensor, instead leveraging only the new data and updated factor matrices. Experimental results show that KG-CTF and OKG-CTF outperform existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods in missing value prediction tasks, achieving superior accuracy in both offline and online settings. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/snudatalab/KG-CTF. In this section, we explain preliminaries of irregular tensor notations, PARAFAC2 decomposition, and knowledge graph, followed by the problem definitions. Table 1 summarizes the symbols used throughout the paper. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t001 An irregular tensor is denoted as , consisting of a collection of slice matrices, where each slice represents the k-th matrix, and K is the total number of slices. Note that the row size Ik varies across slice matrices, while the column size J remains the same for all. PARAFAC2 decomposition [21] has been widely used for analyzing irregular tensors. Given each k-th slice matrix of an irregular tensor , PARAFAC2 decomposes each slice into three matrices: , , and V, as illustrated in Fig 1. This decomposition is formulated as , where is an matrix, is an diagonal matrix, and V is a matrix shared across all slices with R as the target rank. PARAFAC2 converts each slice matrix into , , and for , where is a diagonal matrix. PARAFAC2 converts each slice matrix into , , and for , where is a diagonal matrix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g001 The objective function of the PARAFAC2 decomposition is formulated as follows: where represents the Frobenius norm of matrix X, defined as , with denoting the (i,j)-th element of matrix X. To ensure the uniqueness of the solution, several studies [22,23] reformulate with , where is a column-orthogonal matrix, and is a shared matrix across all slices. A knowledge graph is a collection of triplets that encode facts through entities and their relationships, denoted as . Specifically, each triplet (h,r,t) captures the semantic connection between a head entity h and a tail entity t through the relationship r. For example, the triplet represents the relationship between the book Harry Potter (head entity) and the author J.K. Rowling (tail entity) through the relation Written by in the context of book knowledge. Similarly, in the context of travel, indicates that Central Park (head entity) is related to New York City (tail entity) via the relation Located in. This structured representation of a knowledge graph facilitates the efficient integration of large-scale factual information, serving as additional contextual data. A knowledge graph is expressed as a three-dimensional tensor , which takes the form of either a regular or an irregular tensor. In this paper, we represent the knowledge graph as an irregular tensor , where each is an item-specific slice matrix that forms an (entity-relation) matrix, with rows corresponding to item-related entities and columns representing relations. A more detailed explanation of this representation is provided later in this paper. We define the problems of coupled tensor factorization with knowledge graph in offline and online streaming settings as follows: Problem 1 (Coupled Tensor Factorization with Knowledge Graph). Given. Find. Factor matrices , , , and for , and common factor matrices , , and with R as the target rank, where each k-th slice matrix of the temporal irregular tensor is approximated by , each k-th slice matrix of the knowledge graph tensor by , and each temporal factor matrix by . Problem 2 (Online Coupled Tensor Factorization with Knowledge Graph). Given. Find. Factor matrices , , , and for , and common factor matrices , , and for the entire tensor and where; denotes the vertical concatenation of matrices, old rows of k-th existing slice matrix are approximated by , and new rows of k-th existing slice matrix are approximated by . Each temporal factor matrix is approximated by , by , and each k-th slice matrix of the knowledge graph tensor by . We propose KG-CTF (Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), an accurate coupled tensor factorization method designed to effectively capture both dynamic and static features in irregular tensors. KG-CTF tackles the following challenges to achieve accurate coupled tensor factorization. To address these challenges, we propose the following key ideas (see Fig 2): (a) We introduce a method that couples a temporal tensor with a Knowledge Graph (KG) tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This coupling allows the factor matrices to jointly learn both temporal and static features within an irregular tensor. (b) Relational regularization captures the relationship between the factor matrices derived from the KG tensor, improving their interpretability. (c) To ensure consistent entity representations across all slices, we initialize the entity factor matrix with the updated entity embeddings from . This approach maintains coherence in entity factors across slices, promoting stable learning. (d) We apply a momentum update strategy to ensure faster and stable convergence for factor matrices. At each iteration t, the momentum update refines the current ALS update step for by incorporating the update direction from , leading to a more efficient final update step for .

To capture dynamic information, we leverage the temporally irregular tensor . As described in Eq (1), each slice matrix is factorized using the PARAFAC2 decomposition with a target rank R, yielding three factor matrices: , , and . For example, in stock data analysis, represents the time factor matrix, corresponds to the stock-specific factor matrix, and V serves as the shared stock feature matrix. The loss function designed to capture this dynamic information is formulated as follows: Next, we introduce the knowledge graph tensor as a source of static information and integrate it with the existing temporally irregular tensor . To effectively model the knowledge graph, we represent it as an irregular tensor for two key reasons. First, the number of entities associated with each item varies, inherently resulting in an irregular tensor structure. Second, the conventional entity-relation-entity representation of knowledge graphs leads to exceedingly large and sparse entity factor matrices due to the vast number of entities involved. If the entity factor matrix was constructed using the complete set of entities, the resulting tensor would be highly sparse, making an irregular tensor representation a more effective alternative. To construct this irregular tensor for knowledge graph, we define a slice matrix for each item k, where rows correspond to entities linked to k-th item and columns represent all relation types. Specifically, each matrix is derived from knowledge graph triplets (h,r,t), where the tail entity t denotes the k-th item, the head entity h is an entity associated with that item, and r is the relation type. The (i,j)-th entry of is set to 1 if the i-th entity is connected to item k via the j-th relation, and 0 otherwise. For example, in a stock-related knowledge graph, each item corresponds to a specific stock, with representing its entity–relation matrix for each stock. Triplets such as and indicate that the stock Apple is linked to entities California and IT via the relations located in and industry of, respectively. Accordingly, in for Apple, the row for California has a 1 in the located in column, and the row for IT has a 1 in the industry of column. Therefore, we define the knowledge graph tensor as , where each slice matrix (representing entity-relation interactions for an item) is factorized into three components: , , and . Here, is the entity factor matrix, is the item-specific factor matrix, and R is the relation factor matrix. In this notation, Nk denotes the number of entities linked to the k-th item, L represents the total number of relation types, and R is the target rank. For stock datasets, is decomposed into , , and R, representing entity-specific features related to each stock, stock-level latent factors, and the relation factor matrix shared across all stocks, respectively. Therefore, the loss function for the learning of static information is formulated as follows: To ensure consistent entity representations across different slices and mitigate the inconsistencies that arise from independently decomposing each slice in PARAFAC2, we introduce a shared entity factor matrix approach. As shown in Fig 2(c), the embedding of an entity remains the same across all slices, preserving its representation throughout the decomposition process. For each slice k, the entity factor matrix is initialized using the following strategy: (1) If an entity has appeared in previous slices, its embedding is inherited from the corresponding entity factors in , (2) otherwise, its embedding is randomly initialized. This iterative approach ensures the stability of entity representations while also enhancing their interpretability across slices. Finally, we couple the knowledge graph tensor with the temporal irregular tensor by sharing the common axis . Since is a diagonal matrix that encodes slice-specific information, sharing it allows for simultaneous learning of the dynamic characteristics from the temporal tensor and the static properties embedded in the knowledge graph tensor. Furthermore, unlike other factor matrices (e.g., , V, , or R) that are domain-specific, represents item-level latent factors. Therefore, sharing this static matrix , which is unaffected by temporal dynamics, ensures interpretability while avoiding conflicts between modalities. The overall loss function that couples these two tensors is formulated as follows: We add effective regularizations to the loss function. We introduce a relational regularization term to ensure that the factor matrices obtained from the knowledge graph tensor effectively encode relational structures. Existing methods [24–26] struggle to fully capture the intricate relational dependencies present in knowledge graphs, largely because they overlook the directional nature of these relationships. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate a regularization term that explicitly models the triple structure of the knowledge graph, thereby improving the representation of directional relationships. Based on the approach proposed in [27], we assume that each knowledge graph triplet (h,r,t) satisfies the condition , where h, r, and t correspond to the vector representations of the head entity, relation, and tail entity, respectively. Here, the norm represents the Euclidean distance, enforcing relational consistency within the knowledge graph. For instance, in a stock-related knowledge graph, if the head entity is iPhone, the relation is produced by, and the tail entity is Apple Inc., the relationship is captured by ensuring that remains close to zero. To effectively learn these relational dependencies, we decompose each knowledge graph slice into three factor matrices. The entity factor matrix represents the head entities, the relation factor matrix captures relational properties, and the item factor matrix serves as the representation of the tail entities. To handle cases where an item is connected to multiple entities through the same relation, the regularization term is minimized using the least squares method. For instance, if an item i1 is linked to entities e2 and e3 through relation r1, the objective is to minimize . Given that e2 and e3 are fixed, this can be equivalently rewritten as minimizing . Here, represents the average embedding of e2 and e3. Thus, to incorporate this principle, we define the relational regularization term as follows: where is the diagonal degree matrix associated with , and the (l,l)-th element of corresponds to the number of entities connected to the l-th relation (i.e., the sum of the elements in the l-th column of ). Additionally, is a matrix filled with ones. represents the tail, meaning the embedding of the k-th item padded L times. The matrix represents the relation factor, while represents the head, computed as the average embedding of entities linked by the same relation. Here, represents the embeddings of the Nk entities connected to the k-th item. The product yields a matrix where the l-th row contains the sum of embeddings of entities linked to k-th item through relation l. By applying , we normalize this sum by the number of entities per relation, so that the l-th row of corresponds to the average embedding of entities connected to k-th item via relation l. To further illustrate how the relational regularization term operates, we provide an example in Fig 3. This figure illustrates a case where a head stock h is connected to three entities via four relation types, resulting in a slice matrix . The regularization encourages the tail embedding of stock h, repeated four times as , to be aligned with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head entity embeddings associated with each relation, computed as . This alignment reduces inconsistency between the stock embedding and its relational context in the knowledge graph, resulting in more semantically coherent representations across domains. Given four relation types and three entities connected to stock h, the slice matrix encodes binary connections between entities and relations. The relational regularization term aligns the tail embeddings of stock h with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head embeddings computed over entities connected to stock h per relation. Given four relation types and three entities connected to stock h, the slice matrix encodes binary connections between entities and relations. The relational regularization term aligns the tail embeddings of stock h with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head embeddings computed over entities connected to stock h per relation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g003 To enhance the interpretability of the factor matrices while preserving accuracy, we employ uniqueness regularization by reformulating as , as established in previous studies [22,23], where is a column-orthogonal matrix. This approach mitigates the issue of arbitrary rotations in factor matrices, ensuring that remains unique, up to scaling and permutation. To enforce this constraint, we incorporate the following regularization terms into Eq (1): where is a hyperparameter to control the effect of uniqueness for . We apply L2 regularization to the factor matrices , , V, and R to mitigate overfitting and enhance numerical stability throughout the optimization process: We define the following loss function , incorporating effective regularization terms: Algorithm 1 KG-CTF with momentum-based ALS. Input: and for Output: , , , , for , , , and Parameter: target rank R and momentum strength β 1: Initialize matrices for , and , and R 2: repeat 3: for do 4: Update using Eq (3) 5: , and 6: Update using Eq (4) 7: , and 8: Update using Eq (8) 9: Update using Eq (6) 10: end for 11: Update V using Eq (5) 12: , and 13: Update R using Eq (9) 14: Update H using Eq (7) 15: until the maximum iteration is reached, or the error ceases to decrease We introduce a Momentum-based ALS algorithm that leverages a momentum mechanism to enhance the convergence speed of ALS when optimizing complex loss functions. By incorporating a fraction of the prior update direction into the newly computed factor matrix, the algorithm achieves more stable and faster factor updates. For the factor matrix , let denote its value at iteration t. After performing the standard ALS update to compute , the update is further refined by incorporating a momentum term: where β is the momentum coefficient, typically ranging between 0 and 1. During the initial iterations (e.g., t < 5), β is set to zero to allow the algorithm to stabilize without the influence of previous updates. In subsequent iterations, the momentum coefficient β is assigned a positive value to integrate a portion of the previous update direction into the current update, thus accelerating convergence and enhancing optimization efficiency. By incorporating this momentum mechanism, the ALS algorithm improves its ability to process high-dimensional data, ultimately achieving faster and more stable convergence. Algorithm 1 presents an overview of the proposed Momentum-ALS algorithm. The algorithm starts with the random initialization of the factor matrices, followed by iterative ALS updates. For each slice k, the factor matrices are initially updated using the standard ALS procedure, and a momentum term is subsequently applied to refine the final update. We use an alternating optimization-based update procedure, where each factor matrix is updated independently while keeping the other factor matrices fixed. Updating . We update by setting and rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 1. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for minimizes (Eq (2)): □ Proof: See Appendix. □ Updating . To update , we first transform for k = 1...K into whose k-th row contains the diagonal elements of (i.e., ). Then, we update by setting and rearranging the term based on the loss function (Eq (2)). We update W row by row with the following lemma: Lemma 2. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the k-th row of the factor matrix which corresponds to the diagonal elements of minimizes (Eq (2)): where is a vectorization of a matrix. and * denote the Khatri-Rao product and the element-wise multiplication, respectively. is a vector filled with ones. □ Proof: See Appendix.

When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the factor matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (2)): □ Proof: See Appendix. □ We iteratively update the factor matrices using the update procedure in Lemmas 1 to 7. Each update is the exact closed-form ALS solution of a quadratic subproblem with all other factors fixed, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective and convergence to a stationary local minimum. We provide the time complexity of KG-CTF. Theorem 1. The time complexity of KG-CTF is given by □ Proof: See Appendix. According to Theorem 1, KG-CTF runs in time that scales linearly with the total number of tensor entries, ensuring practicality even for very large datasets. It is also noteworthy that, in most practical settings, the KG information tables are orders of magnitude smaller than the primary tensor (). Consequently, the cubic term + is asymptotically dominated by the linear term in Ik, and its contribution to the overall runtime is negligible. We propose OKG-CTF (Online Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), an accurate coupled tensor factorization method designed to handle both dynamic and static features in streaming irregular tensor data. OKG-CTF addresses the following challenges for accurate coupled tensor factorization in an online streaming setting. We address the above challenges with the following ideas (see Fig 4): We formulate a method to couple a streaming temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This enables factor matrices to jointly learn temporal and static features within an irregular tensor in an online setting. We formulate a method to couple a streaming temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This enables factor matrices to jointly learn temporal and static features within an irregular tensor in an online setting. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g004 We propose a loss function designed to efficiently capture both dynamic and static features from a streaming temporal irregular tensor . The loss function in Eq (2), when applied in streaming settings, suffers from inefficiencies due to redundant computations of the accumulated tensor whenever new data are given. This highlights the need for a more effective strategy tailored for a streaming setting. Therefore, we reformulate the loss function by separating the terms related to old data from those related to new data. When new data are added to each slice matrix of the temporal irregular tensor, the loss function is defined as follows: where () is the hyperparameter controlling the effect of forgetting factor, which determines the relative importance of newly arrived data compared to older data. Specifically, we divide into and , into and , and into and . This approach ensures efficient computation by avoiding redundant operations on old data and focusing on learning from newly arrived data. The forgetting factor plays a crucial role in controlling the balance between retaining historical information and adapting to recent changes. A smaller emphasizes recent data, enabling rapid adaptation to new patterns but increasing sensitivity to short-term noise. Conversely, a larger gives greater weight to historical information, enhancing stability while slowing adaptation to distributional shifts. Thus, defines the trade-off between adaptivity and stability, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate balanced value in practice. We propose an efficient ALS update rule optimized for streaming settings, where one factor matrix is updated independently while fixing the other factor matrices. This rule eliminates the inefficiency caused by repeatedly recalculating terms involving old data whenever new data arrive, focusing on the computation of only new data. When new data are added, the loss function is divided into two parts: one for the old data and another for the new data. During the update process, terms related to old data are loaded without any recomputation, while only the terms associated with the new data are calculated. In the subsequent step, as additional new data arrive, the previously loaded old factor matrix is combined with the computed factor matrix to form the updated old factor matrix, which is then loaded in the next step. This method effectively avoids unnecessary computational growth as data accumulate, ensuring consistent efficiency over time. Algorithm 2 provides an overview of the proposed Momentum-ALS algorithm for OKG-CTF in a streaming setting. It starts by randomly initializing new factor matrices, followed by iterative ALS updates. For each slice k, all factor matrices are updated using standard ALS, with a momentum term applied to refine the final updates. The updated new factor matrices are then merged with the existing ones to update the old factor matrices for the next streaming data. Algorithm 2 OKG-CTF with momentum-based ALS.

We update by setting and then rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 8. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for minimizes (Eq (10)): □ Proof: See Appendix. Updating . To update , we first transform for k = 1...K into whose k-th row contains the diagonal elements of (i.e., ). Then, we update by setting and then rearrange the term based on the loss function (Eq (10)). We update W row by row with the following lemma: Lemma 9. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the k-th row of the factor matrix which corresponds to the diagonal elements of minimizes (Eq (10)): where is a vectorization of a matrix. and * denote the Khatri-Rao product and the element-wise multiplication, respectively. is a vector filled with ones. □ Proof: See Appendix.

We update and , which are factor matrices for the unique regularization, with the following lemma: Lemma 11. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (10)) by solving Orthogonal Procrustes problem [29] due to column-orthogonality: where is a column-orthogonal matrix (i.e., ), and and are left and right singular vector matrices of , respectively. □ Proof: See Appendix. Lemma 12. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the factor matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (10)): □ Proof: See Appendix. Updating and . We update by setting and , and then rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 13. The update rule for to minimize (Eq (10)) is identical to defined in Lemma 6 for (Eq (2)). □ Lemma 14. The update rule for to minimize (Eq (10)) is identical to defined in Lemma 7 for (Eq (2)). □ We alternatively update factor matrices with our update procedure in Lemmas 8 to 14. Each update is the exact closed-form ALS solution of a quadratic subproblem with all other factors fixed, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective and convergence to a stationary local minimum. We provide the time complexity of OKG-CTF for updating the factor matrices. Theorem 2. The time complexity of OKG-CTF is given by □ Proof: See Appendix. Theorem 2 establishes that OKG-CTF’s time cost is linear in the time length Ik,new of the newly arrived data, with as the tensor grows. This leads to significantly reduced computational cost, especially in long streaming sequences. We conduct experiments to explore the following research questions: We provide a detailed overview of our experimental setup, including datasets, baselines, task descriptions, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters. Datasets. We conduct experiments on six real-world datasets, as summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Each dataset comprises a temporal irregular tensor paired with a corresponding knowledge graph tensor. These datasets cover stock markets from the United States (S&P500, NYSE, NASDAQ), South Korea, China, and Japan. For the stock datasets, each temporal irregular tensor consists of a collection of matrices, where each matrix corresponds to an individual stock. Each slice matrix follows a (date, feature) format, with features categorized into two groups: (1) six fundamental features, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume, and (2) 83 technical indicators derived from these fundamental features using the Technical Analysis library (https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For the knowledge graph datasets, we construct triple-based knowledge graphs covering all stocks in the six datasets using the ICKG [30] model. The StockKG dataset contains a total of 89,822 entities, including 14,019 stock entities and 15 distinct types of relations. These datasets are represented as irregular tensors in the format (entity, relation, stock), where each slice matrix is structured as (entity, relation). Here, entities denote the set of associated entities for each stock, and the dataset comprises 15 distinct relation types. # of nnz indicates the number of nonzeros. # of nnz indicates the number of nonzeros. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t002 Update cycle denotes the number of time steps between each update. Update cycle denotes the number of time steps between each update. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t003 We preprocess the real-world datasets by applying normalization methods based on their specific characteristics. For the six stock datasets, we perform z-normalization on each j-th column of the slice matrix X. In contrast, the knowledge graph tensor, consisting of binary values (0 or 1), remains unchanged without any additional normalization. Competitors. We compare KG-CTF against existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods designed for irregular tensors: We compare OKG-CTF with existing streaming PARAFAC2 decomposition methods in an online streaming setting: Task. To evaluate the performance of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, we perform a missing value prediction task on temporal irregular tensor data. We randomly divide the data into training and test entries with the following ratios: , and . Metric. We evaluate the model performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) computed as , where Ω represents the set of test entries in the input tensor X, and denotes the reconstructed tensor obtained from the learned factor matrices. A lower RMSE score indicates better tensor decomposition accuracy. Hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for KG-CTF and OKG-CTF include the target rank R and the regularization strengths , and , along with the momentum coefficient β. We set the hyperparameters as follows: the target rank R to 5 for the China, Japan, and Korea datasets, and to 12 for the S&P500, NYSE, and NASDAQ datasets; the regularization strengths , , , and to 10, 1, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively; and the momentum coefficient β to 0.5. We compare the performance of KG-CTF with baseline models for the task of missing value prediction at test ratios ranging from 10% to 30%. According to Table 4, KG-CTF consistently achieves lower error rates across most datasets. For instance, in the Japan Stock dataset, KG-CTF shows an error rate approximately 1.64× lower than that of PARAFAC2-ALS at 10% test ratio and about 1.52× lower at 30% test ratio. Traditional methods reveal their limitations as they focus primarily on learning dynamic features while neglecting static features. In the NASDAQ, S&P500, and Korea Stock datasets, however, the performance gaps are less pronounced since KG coverage is skewed—a few stocks are linked to many entities while most have very few—so KG signals enhance a limited subset of stocks, reducing the overall benefit of coupling. In contrast, NYSE, China, and Japan Stock datasets exhibit more balanced entity coverage, allowing KG signals to be utilized more uniformly across stocks and resulting in more consistent performance improvements. Additionally, as the test ratio increases from 10% to 30%, the reliance of competing models on dynamic features causes their performance to degrade more significantly, further widening the gap with KG-CTF. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors, respectively. KG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors, respectively. KG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t004 We evaluate the performance of OKG-CTF with baselines in terms of local errors and efficiency. Local Error. We evaluate OKG-CTF’s performance by analyzing local errors, measuring the mean and standard deviation across all updates. Table 5 shows that OKG-CTF consistently achieves much lower local errors than competing models. For example, in the S&P500 dataset, OKG-CTF performs up to 1.17× better than existing models. This is because OKG-CTF learns both dynamic and static features by incorporating auxiliary information with each new data arrival, resulting in more accurate factor matrices. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. OKG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. OKG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t005 Efficiency. We evaluate the performance of OKG-CTF compared to competing models in a streaming setting. In Fig 5, the running time for the N-th update represents the update time for the N-th newly arrived data, rather than cumulative time. Fig 5 presents the results for all datasets in a streaming setting where new rows of existing slice matrices arrive. OKG-CTF demonstrates superior performance, achieving up to 5.7 × faster speeds compared to traditional static PARAFAC2 decomposition methods and streaming PARAFAC2 decomposition methods. Notably, in the NYSE and S&P500 datasets, Fig 5(b) and Fig 5(c) show that OKG-CTF achieves faster updates compared to competing models. This shows that OKG-CTF maintains competitive speed performance, while combining static and dynamic features to learn richer information. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g005 Scalability for newly arrived data size. We evaluate the scalability of OKG-CTF with respect to the size of a new incoming tensor by measuring its running time. We measure execution times across five update cycles [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]. The length of new rows added to existing slice matrices increases linearly with the update cycle. As shown in Fig 6, the results are presented using box plots: the orange line marks the median, the box covers the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles, and the horizontal lines represent and . Fig 6 clearly shows that, in the setting where only new rows are added to existing slice matrices, the execution time of OKG-CTF scales linearly with the update cycle. The size of new rows of existing slice matrices is linearly proportional to an update cycle. The size of new rows of existing slice matrices is linearly proportional to an update cycle. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g006 We conduct an ablation study to evaluate how relationship learning from the knowledge graph and accelerated learning via momentum updates affect prediction accuracy for both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. Table 6 provides the global error results for KG-CTF under 20% missing-value test ratio, while Table 7 reports the local error results for OKG-CTF under 30% test ratio. For each method, we consider three reduced variants: (i) KG-CTF-R and OKG-CTF-R, which omit the relational regularization derived from the knowledge graph; (ii) KG-CTF-M and OKG-CTF-M, which exclude the momentum updates; (iii) KG-CTF-RM and OKG-CTF-RM, which remove both components and thus resemble traditional CTF-ALS. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF consistently show the lowest prediction errors, confirming that incorporating both relational information and momentum updates leads to superior performance. Even though KG-CTF-R and OKG-CTF-R lose some predictive accuracy by excluding knowledge graph relationships, they still outperform their respective -RM variants. Likewise, KG-CTF-M and OKG-CTF-M underscore the benefit of momentum updates, since their performance degrades relative to the full models. These results collectively demonstrate that our models effectively exploit both static relational structure and dynamic temporal information, allowing them to learn more accurate factor matrices for irregular time-evolving tensors. -R and -M indicate the elimination of relational regularization and no momentum update, respectively. Bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. Note that both the relational regularization and momentum update contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. -R and -M indicate the elimination of relational regularization and no momentum update, respectively. Bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. Note that both the relational regularization and momentum update contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t007 We analyze the hyperparameter sensitivity of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF by measuring prediction errors across various key hyperparameters, including target rank, relational regularization, uniqueness, L2 regularization, forgetting factor, and momentum coefficient. Our experiments test four target rank values R of [3, 6, 9, 12], five relational regularization hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five uniqueness hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five L2 regularization hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five forgetting factor hyperparameters of [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], and five momentum coefficients β of [0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]. We use the S&P500 (SP) and NASDAQ (ND) datasets to illustrate KG-CTF’s performance (see Fig 7), and the China Stock (CHN) and Korea Stock (KOR) datasets to examine OKG-CTF (see Fig 8). Note that SP stands for S&P500 and ND stands for NASDAQ. Note that SP stands for S&P500 and ND stands for NASDAQ. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g007 Note that CHN stands for China Stock and KOR stands for Korea Stock. Note that CHN stands for China Stock and KOR stands for Korea Stock. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g008 Rank. We evaluate KG-CTF’s performance on S&P500 and NASDAQ datasets across four target rank values (3, 6, 9, 12). As shown in Fig 7(a) and 7(e), the prediction errors steadily decrease as the target rank increases, reaching their lowest at the highest rank R = 12. These results show that larger rank values consistently yield lower prediction errors, confirming that a higher rank helps capture more complex patterns in the data and improves accuracy. Relational pattern. Both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF incorporate relational regularization derived from a knowledge graph. For KG-CTF, Fig 7(b) and 7(f) illustrate the influence of learning relationships from the knowledge graph for the NASDAQ and S&P500 datasets. Specifically, for the NASDAQ dataset, value of 1 achieves lower errors compared to smaller values such as 0.1 or 0.01. In contrast, the S&P500 dataset performs better with smaller values. This difference arises because the NASDAQ dataset contains a larger number of entities, allowing the model to effectively leverage richer relational patterns. However, excessively large values of can lead to overfitting, particularly on datasets with fewer entities like S&P500, causing the model to learn noise rather than meaningful relational structures. A similar pattern appears for OKG-CTF in Fig 8(b) and 8(f). On both the China and Korea Stock datasets, moderate value of (around 1) produces optimal performance, confirming the importance of appropriately tuning relational regularization to avoid overfitting. Uniqueness. We assess the impact of uniqueness regularization on the performance of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. In both KG-CTF (Fig 7(c), 7(g)) and OKG-CTF (Fig 8(c), 8(g)), we observe that an excessively large degrades performance. Although moderate helps improve the interpretability of the factor matrices, excessive regularization negatively affects the overall performance. L2. We examine how L2 regularization affects prediction performance for both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. As shown in Fig 7(d) and 7(h) (for KG-CTF), the error rates remain largely unchanged across different L2 regularization hyperparameter values. This stability arises from the normalized input tensors, which align the scales of the factor matrices, as well as from the abundant data in the KG-CTF datasets, which support accurate factor updates even without strong regularization. In contrast, Fig 8(d), 8(h) (for OKG-CTF) reveal that larger values clearly increase prediction errors. Because OKG-CTF operates on newly arrived smaller datasets, excessive L2 regularization overly constrains the model, shrinking parameter values prematurely and preventing it from capturing subtle, local patterns. Thus, while the large datasets in KG-CTF reduce sensitivity to L2 regularization, careful tuning of is necessary for OKG-CTF to balance between preventing overfitting and preserving essential information in smaller, more localized datasets. Forgetting factor. OKG-CTF explicitly includes a forgetting factor for time-evolving tensors. As illustrated in Fig 8(a) and 8(e) for the China and Korea stock datasets, excessively large values of negatively impact the prediction accuracy by overly emphasizing outdated data, while very small values discard useful historical information too quickly. In Korea stock dataset, a moderate value () achieves the best performance, balancing the short-term volatility and long-term trends inherent in stock data. Thus, selecting an intermediate value for is crucial, enabling the model to dynamically adapt to recent data trends while preserving sufficient historical context for stable and accurate predictions. Momentum coefficient. We quantitatively analyze the impact of momentum-based updates on convergence speed in both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. We measure convergence as the first iteration (epoch) at which the RMSE drops below a dataset-specific target threshold, with lower values indicating faster convergence. As shown in Fig 9, increasing the momentum coefficient β generally leads to faster convergence across the NASDAQ, NYSE, and S&P500 datasets. For example, in NASDAQ, the model with reaches the target RMSE within just 9 iterations, whereas the baseline without momentum () requires 49 iterations—indicating a 40-iteration improvement. This result highlights that the momentum mechanism becomes particularly effective in high-dimensional, large-scale datasets. However, in the S&P500 dataset, excessively large values (e.g., ) slow down convergence or cause instability, indicating that overly strong momentum may harm training stability. Fig 10 shows similar trends in OKG-CTF. Across all datasets, consistently achieves the fastest convergence; for instance, NYSE reaches the target RMSE in only 5 iterations under this setting. By contrast, higher momentum values ( or 0.9) result in slower convergence and degraded final performance. Overall, these results confirm that moderate momentum effectively accelerates convergence, whereas excessively large values can cause oscillations and suboptimal learning.

Note that ND and SP denote NASDAQ and S&P500, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g010 We describe related works for existing tensor decomposition methods for irregular tensors, streaming tensors, and coupled tensor factorization approaches. Many studies [18,33] have introduced PARAFAC2 decomposition methods for analyzing irregular tensors. Unlike the traditional PARAFAC2-based ALS algorithm [22], RD-ALS [16] and DPar2 [14] apply preprocessing steps prior to factor matrix updates. ATOM [15] further improves the handling of temporal irregular sparse tensors, particularly those with missing values. However, they primarily focus on capturing dynamic features, while static features, which are equally crucial factors, are largely neglected. Integrating static features into the PARAFAC2 model often results in significant bias toward learning dynamic features. This limitation extends to other PARAFAC2-based approaches that do not explicitly incorporate side information. To address this, KG-CTF couples the temporal irregular tensor with the knowledge graph tensor by sharing a common axis, enabling the joint modeling of dynamic and static features while preserving the inherent relational structures among factor matrices. In online streaming settings, tensor decomposition methods [6,34,35] have been developed to efficiently update factor matrices as new data arrive. DAO-CP [9] adapts CP decomposition by detecting changes in tensor streams and selectively reusing or recomputing factor matrices. STF [7] incorporates attention-based temporal regularization to leverage past and future information for improved online learning. For irregular tensors, SPADE [31] updates factor matrices when new slices are added, while DASH [32] extends this by handling both new rows within existing slices and new slice matrices, enabling more flexible updates. However, existing methods focus on dynamic features, neglecting static features, which are equally important. A key limitation of online PARAFAC2 models is that they cannot incorporate static information in an online learning framework, as it remains unchanged over time and does not fit within their update mechanisms. While spectral regularization has been explored in neural networks and factorization models [36–38] to incorporate auxiliary structures, its use in online tensor factorization remains limited. Meanwhile, OKG-CTF effectively integrates dynamic and static features in online irregular tensor decomposition, enabling richer information learning while maintaining efficient factor matrix updates. Previous studies [39–42] have proposed Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) methods to jointly decompose tensors and matrices. HaTen2 [43] and SCouT [44] extend CMTF by implementing distributed CP-based factorization within the MAPREDUCE framework. TASTE [19] introduces a coupled irregular tensor decomposition approach for EHR data, while C3APTION [45] builds on TASTE by integrating a (non-negative) PARAFAC2 model with a (non-negative) CP model. These methods leverage complementary information to achieve data fusion, enabling the extraction of richer information through tensor decomposition. However, relying on simple matrices to represent large-scale auxiliary information has limitations, particularly in capturing intricate relationships. In contrast, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF introduce novel data fusion methods that represent knowledge graph data as irregular tensors, effectively capturing relational structures within the factor matrices. KG-CTF [39] is our preliminary work on coupled tensor factorization, designed to jointly integrate temporal irregular tensors with knowledge graph tensors. In this work, we extend KG-CTF further to effectively handle streaming irregular tensors. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, accurate coupled tensor factorization methods that extend the traditional PARAFAC2 approaches by incorporating a knowledge graph tensor. This integration enables the modeling of both dynamic and static characteristics within temporal irregular tensors in offline and online settings, respectively. Existing methods predominantly emphasize capturing dynamic temporal features while overlooking the intricate multi-dimensional relationships embedded in the data. To address these limitations, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF incorporate relational regularization to effectively capture relational structures within the knowledge graph. Additionally, a momentum-based update strategy is employed to accelerate the factor matrix updates. Our proposed methods achieve superior performance over existing PARAFAC2-based approaches by jointly learning dynamic and static features, leading to improved accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that both methods significantly reduce error rates, establishing them as robust solutions for complex temporal irregular tensor analysis. Future work includes extending KG-CTF and OKG-CTF to a broader range of datasets and further optimizing them to enhance scalability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.s001 (PDF)

We have said from the outset that Bessent was an idiot. His hedge fund was microscopically small despite his Soros connection, which should have been an enormous marketing aid had he been any good. So he’s neither managed anything of size nor been a competent investor. His claims re his role in Soros short of the pound have always seemed exaggerated. Soros is hands-on, particularly with large bets. I suspect at most that Bessent executed trades or did some research. Admittedly John Helmer has depicted Kirill Dmitriev as a blowhard and a relentless self-promoter, but that does not make him wrong on the specific remarks that Bessent derided.

I’m calling the border collie herding a baby sheep video good, as in it really happened. In my visits to NZ in the early 80’s, there was 75 million sheep and 3 million people (down to 23 million sheep thrills and up to almost 5 million Kiwis @ present) and I ended up in a number of ‘Sheepedes’ that lasted 20 to 30 minutes as they just kept coming across the road-with border collies as canine cowboys, round ’em up, bring ’em out, keep ’em in line, rawhide! We are currently foster parents for a border collie. While they are bright, athletic dogs, if you don’t have some chickens or sheep or goats for them to herd, they try to herd you. When the challenge of herding our geese and ducks wasn’t enough, my border collie used to try to herd my kids when they were small. Was more successful than I was. Border Collies are relentless, they even (sort of) herd cats. A friend of mine has a border collie who herds bikers. I find it extremely funny even if I am a keen biker. When you are fostering it. Have you noted who the dog has decided to be the “boss” in the herd? Shadow chasing is another one. Collies can be quite prone to OCD. My better half grew up with a collie in the countryside. It used to attempt to nip the back tyres of passing cars, which terrified me. Don’t be too frightened for doggo. We had a Border Collie that chased cars too. He caught two, and died of old age. British readers may remember the joys of “One Man and His Dog” a sheepdog trials show that was on BBC early Sunday evenings throughout my younger years. The intelligent dogs, the farmers communicating with a whistle and calling “come bai”. The excitement when one of the sheep got separated from the pack and tried to go rogue. I loved that show. Border collies are amazing. Here’s a clip from the 1990s. Trial stats at 4.30 https://youtu.be/fHs5cT5kL58 Thank you, Ben. + 1. “It’s in the power of the eye!” Nice choice of YouTube clip. I told you (below) that TV show is good for a few chuckles. There exist contexts in which a TV sport commentator can say, “For a nine-year old bitch she’s still extremely fast.” Definitely real. I have a rescue that genetic testing showed was perhaps 1/8th border collie, and he does these moves all the time – to us, to dogs he meets, to the feral cats, etc. We were confused at first because the herding dogs I saw previously didn’t get so low to the ground, then I saw a couple videos of border collies and bingo! I would ‘rather claw out [my] own eyes’ than accept a three-month rolling average on a chart that exclusively uses the first eleven days of January across multiple years, which maybe I could get talked into, except it is literally connecting unconnected dots when it links the lines up as tho it is longitudinally contiguous. Rhetorical misrepresentation. (That last sentence scans, that’s when you know I’m miffed.) (Just noticed ‘longitudinally contiguous’ scans too. Whoa Momma! tern should know better.) This is presumably in DD-MM-YYYY format (rather than MM-DD), no? Yes, it is. By the way: there is an international ISO norm regarding dates, and it has the format YYYY-MM-DD. I use it quite systematically — it is unambiguous and is quite appropriate for sorting data. My biggest grudge against people writing the datetime libraries for different programming languages is that none of them use the ISO 8601 as basis and standard. It can handle dates, times, timestamps, time differences, time zones, duration, intervals, recurring intervals and eras. And it’s logical, proceeding from the lowest precision to the highest precision. Somebody should also fix the decimal separator issue for good. no, yes. Thank you, that makes sense. OMG, that chart is so awful. An innumerate LARPing as a statistics postdoc This is why I prefer to be cautious in attributing everything bad to COVID. There is real evidence of risks and damage from each infection, but not everything bad is COVID. “Saudi Arabia’s Dystopian Futuristic City Project Is Crashing and Burning” This project never made sense from the get-go. It seemed to be a cross between a vanity project and a white elephant and was sopping up enormous amounts of resources. In any case, who is even supposed to live in this city assuming it was finished? Saudi Arabia would have been better in spending the money on infrastructure, particularly drought-proofing the country. Considering how many countries are experiencing severe water shortages, that might be a wiser investment. Drought-proofing Saudi Arabia through judicious investment in water management infrastructure? You are talking about the country that decided to empty its aquifers to grow crops in the literal desert. Sir Norman, in addition to being a very talented architect, is one of our era’s greatest con men. His understanding of the vulnerabilities of the plutocratic mind is unparalleled. Doomsday Scoreboard (Micael T) In their 1997 book The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy, historians William Strauss and Neil Howe predicted that between 2005 and 2026 the United States would experience a “Fourth Turning” crisis—a period of social upheaval on the scale of the Revolution, Civil War, or Great Depression. Multiple commentators link recent U.S. crises (2008 recession, 2020 pandemic, political polarization) to this forecast, though no conclusive “cataclysm” has occurred. The cycle is set to resolve by ~2026. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I’m quite taken by the Fourth Turning, or 80 years later if you’d like. Everything lines up so perfectly… 1781 Yorktown 1861 Fort Sumter 1941 Pearl Harbor 2022 Ukraine 1837 Financial Panic-1917 US enters WW1 1849 Gold Rush-1929 Great Depression 1893 Financial Panic-1971 US goes off gold standard 1907 Financial Panic-1987 Financial Panic 1929 Financial Panic-2008 Financial Panic add-on 1865 Appomattox-1945 Tokyo Bay That is a fun scroll. One thing ought to be noted about it. The end-of-the-world predictions related to Christianity are far different from current predictions about the fall of the American Empire or neoliberalism or capitalism. The religious predictions actually entail a physical destruction of the planet to be replaced by a new and better model. If the American Empire falls, it won’t be fun for us who live here, but the planet will continue, perhaps for the better. It all depends on how well the rest of the world can ease the USA down. I’m sure that the Empire will not go quietly. Who will secure its nukes? 1945 Hiroshima & Nagasaki-2025 ? 2025-Teheran & Tel Aviv I doubt if Pakistan will nuke Jerusalem, Dome of the Rock and all that, but I’m not so sure about India. Howe has since extended his timeline to 2032. Historian David Kaiser has an alternative interpretation based on the original Strauss/Howe timeline. He thinks the Fourth Turning already happened, but the BushBama regime failed to unite America with a solution to the financial crises and permanent GWOT, so now we’re in an extended period of disgruntlement sort of like the post-reconstruction era. This is testament to the power of the patterning instinct within us humans. Very glad to see the bonus antidotes today. The sheepdog scene is perhaps to some UK TV viewers not so unusual. Since the 1970s sheepdog trials have been a televised sport in the UK. Close ups of the dog standing still close to the sheep aren’t unusual. Impressive all the same. The BBC produced a show called One Man and His Dog which my mum liked to watch. What the dogs and shepherds accomplish is very impressive but as a TV sport it’s inherently funny, like golf or snooker, owing to the voice commentary having to find novel things to say about it. I expect there are some old clips of the show on YouTube. The cat is wise. My Lucy runs from the room when the printer operates. Following up on yesterday’s Farmer’s Almanac link, it turns out that there are two Old Moores. The Irish Old Moore, Theophilus, was a teacher of languages, a mathematician, and an astrologer. His Old Moore’s Almanac has been going since 1764. The English Old Moore, Francis, was a court astrologer and physician and his Old Moore’s Almanack (note the K) has been going since 1697. Agree! Antidotes without exhaustive investigation to authenticate their authenticity surpass no antidotes by around a million million times. Yes. All doom and no fun makes you go crazy. I always appreciate the antidotes :) > I expect there are some old clips of the show on YouTube. See my comment above :) re: Gaza fascism Germany Kinda funny in a desperate way – Jason Stanley was invited to Germany (Jewish community Frankfurt) to speak about – fascism – what else – on November 9th (saint date) and eventually couldn´t finish his speech becoz “Gaza” – so what about “fascism” now, Stanley? I applaud his honesty. But if the very society claiming absolute wisdom on issues of Holocaust and “fascism” yet over and over and over again denies the genocide “in our time”, what sense does it make to constantly use the term until it has turned hollow because no one listens who does not happen to be a leftist intellectual. It is a very strang situation – I listen to Walter Kirn and then to John Bellamy Foster – go figure. Remember the botched raid on the Marion Record newspaper in Kansas? From the AP and the tv news channel KCTV5: Kansas county agrees to pay $3 million over police raid on a small-town newspaper, editor says. https://www.kctv5.com/2025/11/11/kansas-county-agrees-pay-3-million-over-police-raid-small-town-newspaper-editor-says/ thanks! Seconded. So many of those events that make a big, immediate impact when they occur tend to disappear in the memory hole — especially if things do not unfold according to the approved narrative. Good news. There being consequences for this kind of police behavior is not a given these days. Yves, the Military Summary link might be wrong. The link text says 2025.11.11 but it links to a video two days older with the title Killzone🔴Defense on the Zaporizhzhia Front is Crumbling in Real Time⚡️💥Military Summary 2025.11.09 The state of search on YT is such that I can’t even find that 11.09 video so I have no idea how that happened (I did not watch it). Putting in an 11.11 Killzone link. The search function for YouTube is borked. You can put in a search term and enclose it with inverted commas to search for what you want. But half the search results that come back have absolutely nothing to do with what you are looking for. And the feed is filled with these goofy knock-offs with a thousand subscribers robbing material from interviews of popular commentators from Mearsheimer to Candace. The original interviews or commentary are crowded out. An attempt to starve the content creators or at least slow the growth of ones who speak in contradiction to the Establishment narrative? I hate those. Awful. But sometimes the channel crowds out its own video. It pisses me off no end that Nima will, a couple of days after a long interview, will repost 20-30 minute clips with a different header AND then remove the original!!! I am never giving him a dime due to that behavior. Yves, I want to confirm what .Tom wrote below. I just clicked back 7 months on the “LIVE” tab on Nima’s Dialogue Works and all his long-form interviews are there. I didn’t go further back. Nima, JudgeNap, and other sites should clarify how they use YouTube’s tabs. Nima, JudgeNap, and other sites should clarify how they use YouTube’s tabs. They don’t have a choice on what goes under what YouTube tab. Livestreams go under live tab. That’s it. Judge does his shows live, each one as a separate half hour livestream. Some do a long livestream, and then post interesting parts of it as separate videos, for those that don’t want to watch the whole thing. Bullshit. The channel puts a note under each video summarizing what it is about. Nima et al could easily mention that the shorter segments are clipped from a longer original interview, with a links to them. But they don’t. They want to sucker viewers into thinking a (typically weekend) rerun is fresh content. Bullshit what exactly? I did not even reply to your post, but added some general info about Youtube tabs. I don’t even watch Nima. Nima et al are misleading viewers by reposting their own content and not flagging it as such. The fact that the original still exists but is difficult to find does not change the fact that the publisher is being misleading to generate more clicks, since even a very brief viewing (until the viewer realizes it is a duplicate) is a view in the # viewed listing and almost certainly gives the channel more points with advertisers. If Nima et al was publishing shorter clips for the benefit of time-stressed viewers, he would do so at the same time he posted the orignal content. He does not. He waits until the weekend when viewers for the most part have more time to consume longer interviews. This practice also creates the false impression that the channel is generating more content than it actually is. Your clarification does not alter the fact that this is the publisher operating to the detriment of his audience and has an easy remedy. Agreed on all counts. And for me, that applies double to those I’ll call the Excerpters who jabber about clips of an interview of Y by X and never link the original interview. But the machine-made garbage with 1.6k views mysteriously crowding the top of the feed is the strangest. Maybe I’m watching too many YT vids? YouTube search is … yeah. You can go to the Military Summary channel page https://www.youtube.com/@militarysummary then click the Videos tab and navigate by date. For some channels like Dialogue Works or Judge Nap use the Live tab instead of Videos tab. In any case, the Home tab is usually no use. re: German farmland vs. Big Agro interview by BERLINER ZEITUNG use google-translate Foreign countries are buying up German farmland: “We are experiencing the second structural break in East Germany” Reinhard Jung from the Brandenburg Farmers’ Association on the sell-off of German agricultural land, the failure of politics – and why Germany is losing control. https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft-verantwortung/ausland-kauft-deutsche-aecker-bauernbund-warnt-vor-zweitem-strukturbruch-in-ostdeutschland-li.10004589 “Following the takeover of Deutsche Agrar Holding (DAH) – including around 20,000 hectares of farmland in eastern Germany – by the Australian fund Igneo, an old concern has been rekindled: the “sell-off” of German soil. Thuringian farmer Reiko Wöllert warned in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung of the loss of farmers’ control – his words sparked a broad debate.” Scott Bessent’s Damaging Remarks Puts More Distance between Washington and Moscow Larry Johnson. He is signalling to his PMC comrades that he is in the “correct” side of history. What the populaces think about his words doesn’t matter. So, yes, the same kind of idiot as Starmer, Merz, Macron et al. I’ve seen Bessent in action and he acts like some sort of bully boy and makes criticisms based on what he thinks is real instead of having the Treasury department give him the straight dope. Still, being a bully boy makes him a good fit in the Trump Cabinet. But I do not think that he will give Trump the true picture of the US economy as Trump would not like that. Bessent is just a dummy who is projecting … calls Dmitriev a liar, but he himself is lying through his teeth about India buying Russian oil. Here is the key quote from Larry Johnson: Moreover, I think it is highly likely that Russia and India will find a way to use a third party to continue shipping oil to India in order for India to continue to have access to affordable oil. India just set up a big trading exchange that settles accounts in non-dollars. Rupees/Yuan, Rupees/Dinar, etc. They can set up intermediaries who will buy the oil, settle in rupees, and pass it along (with a cut, of course.) Bessent is either an illiterate who forgot basic economics – if a commodity is priced lower than market price and there is demand for it, middlemen will step in to make a market. Or he’s lying through his teeth. I suspect the latter. But he is gay! (I didn’t ask, I don’t care; but I got told anyway) “Breaking barriers” is more important than competence. ‘Log Cabinet’ member? I wonder if that is in his Lincoln profile. I used to think that Gay Republican meant “Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy.” Now I understand that it means “Epstein Bait.” Robert Barnes was on the Duran yesterday dissecting parts of the Trump administration, with particular animus against Bessent. Very entertaining and colorful, though he still has faith in crypto and in Vance. https://www.youtube.com/live/2MjEkOKoHcg?si=-v9KylaLQAiO3vEd IMO, Barnes, or at least his twitter feed, consistently offers the correct diagnosis (even if you don’t share his worldview)—-but offers the wrong treatments, lmao I always learn something from Robert. Yesterday he said the reason Marco Rubio, a blue-collar son of Cuban refugees, became a successful politician was because his sister married one of the original cocaine cowboys of south Florida. Thinking Miami Vice here. He also got in an actual fistfight with Musk while in the West Wing. Apparently the reason Musk was banned from the White House and then retaliated with a tweet saying that Trump is in the Epstein list. Almost makes me say that Bessent can’t be all bad, but I guess it’s just two total jerks fighting, so it’s still all bad. Though one can still cheer them on. I was not aware that GM’s CEO Mary Barra was previously GM’s head of HR. Barra has been criticized for abrupt firings of well-liked, and well-credentialed executives both recently recruited or having long GM careers. Eric Starkman is a columnist in our local online news mostly news aggregator, http://www.deadlinedetroit.com and Barra critic. He has written about fired executives as easily disposable “Barra bees.” http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32623/starkman_why_gm_employees_should_bail_on_ceo_mary_barra_and_avoid _early_morning_termination_events and http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32552/starkman_gm_under_ceo_mary_barra_is_an_undeniably_soulless_and_dishonest_company changing GM’s old logo to its current sans-serif, lower case “gm” (sic) was the most HR-thing ever, lmao maybe Mary should worry more about build quality, diversifying the model portfolio away from trucks, and V-8 engines not grenade-ing “V-8 engines not grenade-ing” from utube, They Won’t Tell You THE TRUTH About GM V8 ENGINES, So I’ll Do It! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7nr9u2zkfM Mary Barra should also lead an effort to make the front grill of GM vehicles less of a pedestrian killer as they push pedestrians underneath rather than on top of the hood. But then I like the old trucks from the late 1940’s, early 1950’s with the rounded lines. I bought a 1958 Chevy Apache pickup in 1974 for $300. Loved the hood with the little devil horns. It had rusted holes in the floor on both sides large enough to eject empty beer cans. Small cars are also at risk from those behemoths. I saw what looked like a stock (no apparent lift kit) late-model GM pickup parked on the street behind a Toyota iQ the other day and the hood of the pickup was pretty much level with the top of the iQ. One of the benefits of my 1978 New Yorker is that it still came equipped with the pedestrian gunsight on the hood. Sadly, the blood red paint on the coat of arms is fading after all these years. She’s a great person in other ways as well Mr. Wenig and Mr. Wymer have no such worries. In June, Mr. Wenig was re-elected to the board of General Motors, a position that pays $317,000 a year. Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, called the cyberstalking scandal “regrettable” but noted “it didn’t involve any GM business.” Inside eBay’s Cockroach Cult: The Ghastly Story of a Stalking Scandal (NY Times via archive.ph) I guess in this case she forgot her HR mindset. Thanks for that link. The story is truly appalling and both Wenig and Wymer should be in prison, as if that would ever happen. Thanks for the links. The ‘deadline detroit’ 3rd link includes this: Perhaps in the greater scheme of GM’s global workforce of 163,000 employees, but it represents 4% of GM’s Tech Center workforce, assuming the 25,000 workers GM says its Tech Center employs is a current number. GM fired 600 software engineers assigned to its Tech Center campus in August. That’s crazy. Barra herself notes customers are complaining about the clunky software used to transition the screen between options, especially Apple and Android connections. A problem that could be fixed with better car software. Her answer? Layoff tech software engineers and….get rid of Apple Car Play and Android Auto and other ‘troublesome’ connections in the new cars. Let a 3rd party design new software.

By destroying the perceived impartiality of AI, they’ve undermined trust. Once nobody trusts that “muh AI” is unbiased and free from tampering by the Central Scrutinizer, they’ll ditch it and rediscover the joys of using your mind. Maybe. Well, we can always hope. It’s useful for timeless questions like Should I put bacon on the salad? Obviously not. Duh! And you shouldn’t eat cheeseburgers either. So Isr is going to try “google bombing” AI. Doesn’t surprise me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bombing Absolutely: The Economist catches up with what a colleague has been complaining about for years, rule by HR ladies. Further, DEI in various iterations has been around for quite a while. This sentence bemusedly gets to the point, but the chronology is older than the 2020s: ‘ For an “insecure” profession that is “prone to scramble around for fashions and fads”, in the words of one hr director, dei brought plenty to keep busy with, from micro-aggressions to non-gendered toilets. ‘ Jennifer Pan was interviewed by Joshua Citarella on his excellent DoomScroll vlog. The interview is entitled “Selling Social Justice.” She describes the coopting of these initiatives into an extension of management. As Adolph Reed keeps pointing out, a more “diverse” ruling class of oppressors is still a group of oppressors. The expression “rule by HR ladies” also reminded me of a phenomenon that I see / saw in my career in publishing. I’m sure other commenters have seen the same phenomenon in their fields: The division of organizations into fiefdoms. HR is definitely “feminized space” — although it’s main job is to defend the company against the employees. In certain realms of publishing, editorial is women, and marketing is the men. It all becomes a tad too obvious. Oddly, though, publishers just can never find young black men to hire. I wonder why. It’s not just publishers whose HR departments can’t find the black people. A company I’m familiar with determined several years ago that it was short on minority hires and about that same time, the entire workforce was blessed with DEI training. Some did wonder why the rest of the company needed “training” because HR couldn’t hire any minorities (heal thyself!), but I digress…. The solution? An explicit call for more employees to refer minority friends for open positions, with referral bonuses being doubled if it resulted in a minority hire. I wish I was kidding. It has taken me a while to find it but that Economist article is a just a rehash of a Times article from September. https://archive.is/xemtx#selection-1459.0-1463.16 How HR took over British business and got in the way of actual work There are now more people working in human resources departments in Britain than there are doctors or lawyers. They have made workplaces more pleasant but at what cost to productivity? Harry Wallop reports Thursday September 18 2025, 5.00am BST, The Sunday Times [Don’t as me why the Sunday Times publish on Thursday. It’s an internet thing…?] All the worst organisations I have worked in had HR as a major power centre and the HR director as some witchy familiar of the CEO. Their common failing as organisations has been the HR mentality: defensive, duplicitous and at every opportunity valuing form and process over judgment. Toxic cargo cults, the lot of them! Re: Ben Shapiro saying people should move for jobs. Is This The WORST TAKE On The Affordability Crisis? Young Turks, YouTube. It’s gratifying to watch Ben Shapiro self-destruct. ***** That’s actually pretty standard conservatism from the 1990s and 2000s, “we gotta move people to jobs and not jobs to people”, so it’s good to see some growth in thinking among the conservative base, away from Ben Shapiro, National Review, etc. Ben Shapiro says lots of stuff which he does not think through- ‘ADAM @AdameMedia Nov 9 Ben Shapiro: Reparations don’t work. Charlamagne: They worked for Jewish people. (They *still* receive HoIocaust reparations) Shapiro: Erm, uh, that’s totally different! Israel took $500b from America (and $30B since Oct 7).

What about Iran, Iraq, Afganistan, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Cuba, Panama, Grenada, Peru, Venezuala, Palestine, hell even Japan, South Africa and Russia not to mention tens more I’m sure I’m forgetting. The US didn’t even ouright persecute Jews during WWII more than they supported Apartheid in SA, so what the hell are they giving them reparations for? So I see a collision of recent STEM graduates who buy a house with a 50 year mortgage (with very equity) finding no jobs due to US deindustrializing and shutting down biomedical research walking away to China or Russia for a sustainable job (and probably leaving both debts behind). “Failure to plan is planning to fail.” Just spitballing here, but I think the demand in China or Russia for US graduates who never considered learning Chinese or Russian is going to be quite low. Although that observation does support your aphorism. Oh, I know some young scholars who are tackling mandarin. A job these days is a great incentive. Some Chinese guys were trying to recruit me about a decade ago. I was very tempted. What’s tackling language 6 if it keeps you fed…? Would a hire of somebody from a deindustrializing country be known as a ‘westback’? Foreign devil Get the Epstein LLC involved and you can call it a bawdy shop. Whiteneck? “we gotta move people to jobs and not jobs to people” So, get more migrants in, instead of outsourcing everything. Lavrov: “The EU may argue that we ‘invaded’ Ukraine in violation of certain agreements.” “We wanted Ukraine to keep its economic ties with Russia.” “Let’s take a year off.” *Blink* Parse at your own risk. That ain’t my take. “Paris, France. Andrei Martyanov” I see this everywhere. In one of the small towns in Normandy near me, I recently saw seniors getting together to share their bounty from the local Carrefour supermarket, under the market square roof. They brought thermoses of coffee and tea to share with each other. About 15 people. I was also recently in an industrial park in a suburb of a major 2 tier city, to pick up some paint for my house. Next to the paint supplier was a food bank “Les Restos du Coeur”. There was a line of at least 50, in the middle of the afternoon on a Wednesday. People looked working/middle class. Decently dressed, many with their children (Wednesday afternoon is off for grade schoolers). Before the pandemic, I’d see groups of pensioners in Versailles, in front of the Franprix there, by the movie theatre. Maybe 10, like the video posted. At the intersection of D capitulationism and L’affaire Epstein, the thought occurs that in addition to potentially or probably (depending on what the Rs do with the promised ACA vote) keeping the ACA premium subsidies issue alive for the mid-terms, by bring the House back into session to deal with the continuing resolution, the capitulation accelerates the Epstein files discharge petition that Speaker Johnson would prefer to suppress. It might actually be smart politics (from D party interests perspective, regardless of real-world impacts on the population); the fact that it is being characterized as D fecklessness might be a bonus. This thought is not offered in praise of the Party; what has been done might be an objectively evil calculation, but a clever one. I think they’re playing good cop/bad cop. The “centrist” dems were recruited by the dnc to be the firewall against any movement left. It’s a rotating and unbeatable cast from manchin and sinema to the current crop of left wing republicans, We are a one party state, Remember the mississippi guy who self financed and was excoriated by the “centrists” for bucking the party. Mamdani sends chills down their spine. Socialism is for the rich and deserving. Part at least of the reason the r’s can’t replace ocare is because ocare is their plan so the protests are all an act. From their collective perspective mamdani winning was a major loss. They’re despicable. And guaranteed grocery lobbyists were banging their turkey pans to get the money flowing. Maybe the epstein thing will pan out, and maybe not,As an confirmed cynic I lean to the latter. Somebody tell me what I’m missing other than the Democrats wanting to slow walk to the day ACA health insurance premiums are $5,000 per month and still in need of subsidies. As I am ALWAYS in search of methods to amuse myself, I was over the moon wonderstruck by the link to the young lady playing classic rock on the Chinese lute. I lost an hour of a otherwise mundane morning grinning from ear to ear. Thank you for the link, which has now been shared with all my music friends (with source attribution, of course) She’s good, but can she do covers with throat singing in Mongolian translation? Side note: The Hu mostly do originals. Had a chance to see the, live a few years ago and they were great. The Hu were one of the bands that helped get me out of the grumpy old man “all new music sounds like stuff I’ve heard before” doldrums I had been in for a while. Their first album is truly special. Last year they released a cover of Iron Maiden’s The Trooper: The HU – “The Trooper” (Official Music Video) In case of “all new music sounds like stuff I’ve heard before” syndrome, nine out of ten doctors recommend getting out of your comfort zone. :) Jokes aside, musical genres can be defined as stuff that sounds like some other stuff. There is always new & unheard stuff in unconsumed genres, and in the space betwen them (for an example see below). Here’s something for your musical friends :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT7x1NvGf5k&list=RDEM6kSy5Si3f_-hq8qxMKi3Lw Hudson/Wolff on Mamdani and much else. Great stuff. https://michael-hudson.com/2025/11/municipal-socialism-meets-donor-politics/ “And the Republicans and Democrats want to treat New York City like the United States and Europe treated Soviet Russia after its revolution.” Might want to slow the row on all of that hyperbole. Not denying the part about the obstacles coming, but it’s not like it was the Russian Revolution. Mamdani could play Kerensky in this psychodrama. “TRUMP PLAYS THE OLD CIA CARDS FOR REGIME CHANGE” A pro-tip for the Trump regime. If you are going to send covert operations teams into a country like Venezuela, then best you do not advertise the fact but keep everything quiet. Trump does not need the spectacle of a bunch of captured CIA spooks shown off in public. Caitlin Johnstone explains the Israeli “don’t be a sucker” method. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/11/10/caitlin-johnstone-israels-successful-method/ Trump calls this “the art of the deal.” “If I don’t steal your home, someone else will steal it” 3 Epstein emails released by the Dems, all involving Trump. https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/3-emails_redacted.pdf Per the Guardian In one of the memos, Epstein wrote to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011 that Trump “spent hours at my house” in the company of one of the disgraced financier’s sex-trafficked victims. The memo describes the president as “that dog that hasn’t barked”, and notes Trump had “never once been mentioned” in connection with what has become a long-running scandal overshadowing his second term of office. A second message, sent by Epstein in April 2011 to Trump biographer Michael Wolff, indicates that Trump had asked him to resign from Mar-a-Lago, the president’s exclusive members-only club in Florida. But Epstein said he was “never a member ever” and adds “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”. Ben Panga: It’s all fun and games till Bill and Hillary show up on lists. Then watch the Dems squeal. My attitude: Mr. Guillotine’s clever meat slicer. One size fits all. Bill and Hill are pretty far back in the rear-view mirror, even for the Dems. A trade of sacrificing that duo in exchange for taking down Trump seems more than even, to me. Then there is the Wizard of Kalorama, who would surely benefit somehow from all of their downfall. I’m more than a bit skeptical of the authenticity of those emails, no? I find Whitney Webb’s articles credible. By that metric, specifically the power dynamic Webb describes existing in the sphere of Epstein’s bosses and business associates, the Clintons may be untouchable. The same method would explain Maxwell still being alive and enjoying privileges while in confinement. This is Robert Maxwell’s daughter after all. I always said the NC link header “L’affaire Epstein” should be “L’affaire Maxwell-Epstein”. Last night’s northern lights was quite something to see~ Tonight’s spectacle promises to be something special, peaking around 10 pm @ an overhead view near you. Unfortunately it looks as if Big Smokes and coastal cities in Cali will have poor visibility for the event, time for an after-work road-trip Californios! Our new planetarium had a great show called Aurora where a photographer went to Yellow Knife in Canada and pointed a hi def wide view camera straight up at the Northern Lights. On the planetarium dome it’s you are there. Spectacular. > Starmer allies issue warning to PM’s rivals as fears grow over leadership challenge Guardian What do dissidents in the PLP think they accomplish by replacing Starmer as PM with Angela Rayner, Shabana Mahmood or Ed Miliband? Seems to me the constraints of any neoliberal UK government are pretty much set and policies follow from that. Any such government will be hated soon enough. Making Miliband the face of it doesn’t fix much. Or what am I missing? Reportedly Labour party members are terrified that they are going to lose huge numbers of local government seats at the elections due in May 2026. Some seem to think that a fresh face will enable them to reduce their losses then. All very short-term thinking. Of course the big showdown, the national General Election, will probably not take place until 2029. Today, the House does something it hasn’t done since September 19th: show up for a vote. And even in September, these stumblebums worked for a grand total of twelve days. Must be nice. Back in July, when the cowardly Mike Johnson skedaddled out of town like a fly-by-night con artist to evade a vote on the Epstein files, NFL training camps hadn’t even opened. The plan apparently is to vote on the new bill to reopen the government, take a long weekend, and possibly work a few days next week before disappearing again for Thanksgiving week. I think this deserves a tribute in song.

Carry on, my Epstein bums The skids are greased now, shutdown’s done Lay your committee heads to rest Don’t you trade, don’t you trade no more [Instrumental outro] (Melody and original lyrics by Kansas, “Carry on my wayward son”) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ZJui3aPoQ&list=RDP5ZJui3aPoQ Would state referendums requiring elected officials from the state spend a minimum of 40 hours a month meeting with constituents ( must live in the district, be from a variety of financials classes present in the district and cannot include lobbyists) be legal? This including both state and federal members. I would love to see elected officials be legally required not just to have to meet the responsibilities of their job more than their fundraising, but to have one of the required responsibilities to be regularly meeting with the people they are elected to represent. Instead we are paying a lot of people to beg and suck up to a small coterie of rich people. One of the arguments I heard Mike “the weasel” Johnson make was to the effect of, “oh, we’re still working, we’re just back in our districts meeting with constituents.” And there may be some truth to that, although something tells me that not all 435 of these guys and gals were really spending their time talking to the rabble, and not off on a junket bending the knee for the Israeli flag. Or fundraising. Your idea is an excellent one, but I have no idea if it would pass Constitutional muster. I’m 100% for such meetings! Considering how much of their time is occupied in funds raising, perhaps the best way to rein in the political parties would be to revoke their tax exempt status. Then go after all those dodgy “Advocacy Committees.” simpler to just feed them to the pigs and start over. altho i am a bit drunk and surly…spent 3 hours in a mudhole fixin mom’s ancient water supply pipe(1960’s era black poly pipe)…and cannot lay down, lest i seize up, entirely. laid down the law…instead of spending 25K on fixin the whole decrepit system under her house, she will pay me 5k to walk by and get it done, come spring. all the 100+ years of under the house plumbing will be simply disconnected, and left in place. all the random repairs done in that time, by unknown folks, with whatever was to hand, ignored. we’ll do what i did with my house, and go around the perimeter, and only come into the house where required…. that 3 hours of bullshit honey-do kicked my ass….and covered my whole body with mud. but i walked by, and got it done, and she has water. fie. Poor man, well do I remember the abomination that is black poly pipe. Coterminal with the old multi-layered tarpaper sewer pipe. The only thing I feared more than those two was repairing lead and oakum joints in cast iron sewer pipe. Sleep well, you’ve earned it. Myself spent hours digging under the porch, tracking a groundhog tunnel that took aim at our new sewer line. Second hole I dug myself in today. Thanks for the song. Excellent work once again. Disrespecting sacred spaces is part of… the hallmark of Western imperial colonialism. Ànd probably colonialism in general. I am not a scholar. Common experiences of many sacred spaces in times of conquest–symbolically convert infidels’ houses of worship to your own, if they are important enough, or blow them up. Hagia Sofia is a famous example, but many mosques/churches in Iberia and Middle East used to be churches/mosques, and, of course, many Protestant churches used to be Catholic (well, almost anything in England) and quite a few churches belonging to the wrong peoples were blown up (if only figuratively in some cases), like Alexander Nevski in Warsaw. Just wait until the nukes go off above Jerusalem. Meanwhile in Ellison world claims that they are blacklisting actors who object to genocide. Guess Emma Stone won’t get to star in any of Taylor Sheridan’s dubious products. https://scheerpost.com/2025/11/11/paramount-blacklisting-hollywood-figures-critical-of-gaza-genocide/ More Teens Are Taking Antidepressants. It Could Disrupt Their Sex Lives for Years. (NY Times Mag via archive.ph) Research on adults who take S.S.R.I.s shows they tamp down sexual desire. Why aren’t we studying what that could mean for adolescents who take them? You know what else is happening to teens and adults every year? COVID. COVID penis is a thing. If you want a functional johnson, don’t get infected! But we don’t care about repeat infections with a level 3 biohazard, no issues there! The effects of S.S.R.I.s on young sexuality are all the more relevant because prescriptions for the drugs have soared. Around two million 12-to-17-year-olds in the United States are on S.S.R.I.s. One large 2024 study in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics tallied, month by month, the percentage of that age group who filled an antidepressant prescription between 2016 and 2022. During that time, the rate climbed by 69 percent, with the Covid pandemic’s emotional reverberations almost surely playing a part, though a notable rise was underway before then. Among college students in 2023-24, according to a survey with over 100,000 participants, 22 percent had taken an antidepressant during the previous year. This was up from 8 percent in 2007. (bold mine) If you think that’s bad, just wait until you get long COVID! Does long COVID come with long johnson? It might leave you longing for the return of your johnson. An old girlfriend of mine didn’t call it a johnson…she called it an opportunity. From Trump’s H-1B Visa Crackdown to Accelerate Wall Street’s Expansion in India Catch this; Remote work for capitalists offshoring to save a buck, but not for you, to improve your life Trump’s $100,000 fee for visa applications — which JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said “caught everyone off guard” — could add to India’s edge, just as the pandemic gave GCCs a boost by showcasing the potential of remote work. Companies that might consider transferring a worker to the US may now opt to hire them in India instead, banking executives said. (bold mine) Remember, learn to code? Get a STEM degree? LOLz “With the new fee, they’re starting to question if that job is a priority for them,” said Ben Hodzic, head of North America at recruitment firm Selby Jennings. Jobs with a heavy math or computer science component are most at risk, he said. Thanks Obama! For most roles, India offers employers significant salary savings relative to other countries. For an entry level role at a US bank’s GCC, an engineering graduate could earn between 300,000 rupees ($3,384) to 800,000 rupees a year, depending on the location. That compares with $60,000 for an Indian on a US visa, and up to $120,000 for a US citizen in the same role, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s some serious labor arbitrage, no? And once again we see that H1B was about suppressing US wages. What is the tweet from “RT.” supposed to be claiming? $NVAX has been flat since 2023. That blue line is not real. ‘Human safaris’ in Sarajevo: Milan investigates 1990s trips where tourists allegedly paid to kill civilians, El Pais. Sniper tourism. Reminds me of the Brazilian movie Bacurau. It should remind you of Ukraine, and Syria, and all the other places where USA sponsored “freedom fighters” did their thing, and still do their thing. For sure, and in this case willing to pay around a hundred grand for the privilege. To be weekend snipers, they reportedly paid the equivalent of between €80,000 ($92,800) and €100,000 ($116,000), according to the first hypotheses of the investigation. Shooting at children cost more. Alleged, thesis, allegedly, according to the complaint, reportedly, according to the first hypotheses, rumored, clues about the possibility, “an urban legend”, Russian. In this case, I belive that the USA side did it, just like in all other cases. Accusing the “Russians” is part of the spiel. I won’t argue that point as it’s always a reasonable argument, and it sounds like something the izzies/usians would do. It’s the demand side that baffles me. And this was back in the 90s. How much has the industry grown since then? The client list would likely make for interesting reading. I heard the same about Lebanon during the civil war there. Wealthy westerners would pay for trips in to do a bit of sniping so that they could go home with some human kills on their board. Something tells me though that those kills were not Lebanese soldiers or militias. An ingenious way to fund the cause, it’s like having a bake sale. Speaks well of the human condition, lol. Rare good news. My auto insurance went down again. Farm bureau insurance of NC. Kinda shocked. https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Asia/Trump-Revives-USCentral-Asia-Ties-with-25-Billion-in-New-Deals.html According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, the deals between U.S. and Central Asian firms totaled $25 billion and included: All American Rail Group Global: rail construction and engineering in the Kyrgyz Republic Boeing: up to 15 787 Dreamliners (Kazakhstan); up to four 787 Dreamliners and 10 737 Max airliners (Tajikistan); and eight more 787 Dreamliners, bringing the prior total to 22 widebody jets (Uzbekistan) Cove Capital: privatization of a tungsten mining company in Kazakhstan John Deere: agricultural machinery for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan Leidos: upgrade of Kazakhstan’s National Air Traffic Management System. MOUs between Nvidia, the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence & Digital Development, and Freedom Holding Corporation for Advanced AI chips in Kazakhstan The key takeaways from the C5 +1 are: Strengthening the Strategic Partnership and Mutual Trust. The U.S. and the republics underscored their shared commitment to building a long-term, strategic dialogue based on mutual respect, trust, and shared values. The C5 + 1 partnerships will be grounded in transparency, innovation, and shared global responsibility. Deepening Economic and Investment Cooperation. U.S. focus is shifting to economics and business and away from security-only policies. The leaders’ meetings with U.S. business and financial leaders laid the groundwork for a new phase of trade, investment, and industrial collaboration in key areas such as green energy, advanced manufacturing, infrastructure development, digital transformation, and technology innovation. Advancing Regional Connectivity and Sustainable Development. Economic connectivity, energy transition, regional security, and climate resilience are key to regional unity and integration, fostering a stable, prosperous, and interconnected Central Asia that contributes to global peace and sustainable development. Opening a New Chapter in U.S.–Central Asia Relations. The leaders’ shared vision aims to foster innovation, resilience, and shared prosperity for the U.S., Central Asia, and the broader international community. OMG Sergey Lavrov: “We know what the Americans have, and the Americans know what they have. Let’s take a year to, so to speak, cool down Sanity “EU eyes banning Huawei, ZTE Corp from mobile networks of member countries” and “EU’s top judge hits out at Viktor Orbán, warning that the bloc’s funds must not enrich a ruling elite” or some naughty nation’s “public procurement is systematically refused to out-of-state business, favouring the businesses around the leader or the governing party, the leading party.” The unelected leaders of the EU institutions really see themselves as the shit bedraggled tail wagging the member state dogs. Just to make it clear that it is Hungary being sent to the naughty corner because it’s elected officials are protecting the country’s national interests the “EU’s top Judge”, in the words of the Euractiv report, Lenaerts, who “argued that participation in the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) – the EU body that investigates and prosecutes crimes involving the Union’s funds – should be mandatory for all countries that receive EU funds. “He described how in some member states probes by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) – the EU agency tasked with detecting misuse of EU money – “end up in the wastebasket,” lamenting that “the whole system is closed.” “Hungary, notably, has refused to join the EPPO, even though it has no formal opt-out from EU justice cooperation — leaving OLAF dependent on national prosecutors in Budapest, who critics say rarely act on its findings.” Wonder what stage OLAF and the EPPO have got to in the investigation and prosecution of fonda Lyin’s no longer existent trail of electronic messages dealing with EU business. Maybe Huawei and ZTE Corp can throw some light on the contents for us? Leavitt to Believer This week’s episode has Karoline on the defensive, it appears that it was Eddie Haskell who pal’d around with Jeffrey Epstein-not the President. In a Hail Mary toss, she even seemed to implicate Genocide Joe but it fell to the groundless. File under A Win For Womens Sports. From Vigilant Fox: The Olympics Finally Admit What Everyone Already Knew: Men Have an Advantage in Women’s Sports https://www.vigilantfox.com/p/the-olympics-finally-admit-what-everyone “The Olympic Committee appears to have suddenly stumbled across startling new evidence that suggests biological men have advantages over women in sports. Multiple reports are outlining that the IOC is to enact a new policy banning transgender individuals from competing against women. It will also cover those with differences of sex development (DSD), essentially individuals found to have XY chromosomes, such as Imane Khelif, the boxer who punched through every women to win gold at the last Olympics in Paris. Newly released emails reveal Epstein kept close eye on Trump (Guardian) (more emails than the 3 in the news last night) Epstein as Mossadish actor is not getting less believeable.

Title: How Catastrophic Is It If the AI Bubble Bursts? An FAQ. - The Ringer

Full Content:
You've probably noticed that many people are saying we're in an AI bubble. "OpenAI's Sam Altman sees AI bubble forming," CNBC reports. "Fears of an AI bubble are growing," NBC News states. "AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All," Wired announces. "Mark Zuckerberg says a ‘collapse’ is ‘definitely a possibility,’" Fortune declares. You've probably also noticed that almost everyone who uses the term “AI bubble” starts to sound very boring and confusing immediately afterward. This is because the people who bring up the AI bubble tend to be market analysts, and most market analysts would rather have potatoes growing inside their bodies than talk like a normal person for four seconds. So what is an AI bubble? Are we in one? How scared should you be? What happens if the artificial intelligence industry blows a trillion-dollar hole in the non-artificial economy? What happens if it doesn't? Let's walk through this thing together. Yes. Because the gigantic numbers floating around the AI economy—deals worth trillions, data centers costing tens of billions, 75 percent of gains in the S&P 500 centered on AI stocks—are almost entirely driven by hype, and the hype has come unglued from reality. The hype around AI insists that it's a world-transforming technology that will revolutionize every aspect of human society. The reality, which we'll explore in more detail in a second, is that AI companies are burning through staggering amounts of money (and fossil fuels) with no clear path to profitability, that the companies themselves aren't super clear about what their products are for, and that many of those products have failed to perform in the applications they've been assigned to (AI search engines return inaccurate information, AI teachers impair learning, AI therapists make mental health worse). Worse yet for the industry, the biggest players are increasingly tied up in time-bomb financial deals that look disastrous for their futures in any but the rosiest of best-case scenarios. But because the hype around AI is so pervasive—who doesn't want to own a chunk of the technology that will determine every aspect of humanity's future?—investors have continued plowing money into the field despite the warning signs, sending stock prices into orbit. As of last week, Nvidia, the leading AI chipmaker, is the first company in history whose stock is priced at over $5 trillion in total—meaning this one individual company accounts for roughly 8 percent of the S&P 500. That's a bubble. Plain English Tackles the AI Bubble Everybody Thinks AI Is a Bubble. What If They’re Wrong? This Is How the AI Bubble Could Burst Is AI Really About to Solve Human Disease? Plain English Tackles the AI Bubble Everybody Thinks AI Is a Bubble. What If They’re Wrong? This Is How the AI Bubble Could Burst Is AI Really About to Solve Human Disease? It's what happens when the price people are willing to pay for a thing exceeds the value of the thing by some drastically untenable amount. It's hard to give a more technical definition, because determining the correct value of anything is weirdly tricky beyond a certain point. Markets, for all that people pretend otherwise, are extremely susceptible to vibes. Past bubbles have inflated around everything from tulips to Japanese real estate to the original wave of dot-com stocks in the early 2000s, but let's run with a simpler example. Say there's a new hype sneaker. It costs $18 to manufacture, it retails for $100, and it's going for $1,800 on StockX. What's its correct value? Everyone can kinda sense that $1,800 is too much to pay for it, but the price keeps going up, so people keep snapping up more pairs, often hoarding multiples in the hope of flipping them for a profit. The price hits $2,000. Then, suddenly, a guy gets nervous and sells 10 pairs for a little less than the current max. People notice this and start selling off their own pairs for whatever they can get before the price craters. By the end of the next day, the bubble's popped. The price is down to $150. People who held their pairs take a massive loss; people who flip sneakers full time have spent a fortune and can't sell their current pairs for enough to refresh their inventory. Why did the price spike? Because people convinced themselves it made sense to spend that much. Why did the price collapse? Because the people who collectively propped up the delusion that the price made sense got spooked and decided to get out with what they could before everyone else decided it didn't. It means that the AI industry's most important product at this moment is not a chatbot or a video generator; it's the story the AI industry is telling about itself. There's a saying stock market people pass around: "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." The market is definitely irrational right now; the goal of the AI industry is to keep it irrational until the industry can figure out a way around the mess it's created for itself. How bad is the mess? OpenAI's ChatGPT, by far the most successful generative AI product to date, requires so much expensive computing power to run that it loses money almost every time you use it. (For the first half of 2025, OpenAI took in $4.3 billion in income and still reported a net loss of $13.5 billion.) A recent Deutsche Bank report says that the AI boom is "unsustainable." Bain & Co.'s annual global technology report says the AI industry will need $2 trillion in annual revenue by 2030 to continue at its current rate. (That number will be, um, hard to come by.) A Bank of England report warns that the market could experience a "sharp correction" due to the overvaluation of AI companies. Companies with no clear plan for making money from AI have poured cash into the construction of data centers so massive that they're straining the electrical grid and driving up the price of electricity for the rest of us. They've poured cash into what's called "compute"—processing power, basically, used to train AI models and run search queries—at a rate they can't keep up unless the entire world economy reorganizes itself around their products by, like, Tuesday. All that tech has a shelf life, just as your iPhone does; the industry will have to keep spending ruinous sums every few years to replace it. And to keep the ball in the air, the companies have made a number of increasingly bizarre, shady, and circular deals with each other: Nvidia, for instance, has invested $100 billion in OpenAI, which OpenAI must then turn around and spend on Nvidia products. If I give your lemonade stand $10 so you can buy my $10 lemons, we can't tell our investors (your mom) that we've boosted the lemonade economy by $20. But that's the kind of reasoning that fuels more and more of Silicon Valley's grandiose claims about itself. The thing is, though, the price of a stock is not determined by the soundness of the company. It's determined by the willingness of investors to pay a certain price. And there are ways to convince investors to pay high prices for shares even when it means driving through an endless series of flashing red lights. If you can, say, leverage three decades of mythmaking about the transformative impact of the tech industry by convincing a compliant press to spread the word that your new product is poised to make every sci-fi dream a reality—cure cancer, bring humanity to other planets, create flying cars—then the sheer size of the vision you're peddling might convince investors to buy in, even if doing so seems reckless. Tech investors, especially the superrich ones, are always in the market for stories scaled to their egos, and their egos are getting more messianic all the time. And in the era of crypto and Robinhood, regular idiots like us increasingly see the stock market as a casino. Pushing some chips onto the new, hot, famous, sexy thing seems way more exciting than researching the fundamentals of some well-run company no one's talking about. Plus, everyone else is doing it. OpenAI is currently targeting a $1 trillion IPO. The basis of that number is not—like, extremely not—the solid state of the business. It's the story the company is telling. Talking a big game has thus become the essential and necessary activity of AI companies. (This includes acknowledging the possibility of a bubble as a form of panic mitigation: That way, if the bubble does pop, the wise, patient tech CEOs can say they expected it all along.) AI storytelling is an amalgam of several different narratives, including: As far as I can make out, the scheme is essentially: Keep the ship floating for as long as possible, keep inhaling as much capital as possible, and maybe the tech will get somewhere that justifies the absurd valuations, or maybe we'll worm our way so far into the government that it'll have to bail us out, or maybe some other paradigm-altering development will fall from the sky. And the way to keep the ship floating is to keep peddling the vision and to seem more confident that the dream is inevitable the less it appears to be coming true. Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Yes. Last week, as Nvidia was crossing the $5 trillion threshold—making the chip manufacturer worth approximately as much as the gross domestic products of France and South Korea combined—several of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies released their earnings reports. It was a sensitive moment for big tech. All year, murmurs of a bubble had been growing louder. Deutsche Bank called summer 2025 "the summer AI turned ugly." A series of bad earnings reports could have triggered a major sell-off. The air over Northern California could have echoed with a hollow popping sound. Instead, the earnings reports were … OK? Alphabet, Google's parent company, notched its first $100 billion quarter. Microsoft beat expectations. Meta's stock slid after it announced a one-time tax charge, but not drastically. No bubbles were seriously threatened. If you looked a little more closely, though, there were further signs of strain in the industry. Microsoft's stock slid 5 percent immediately after its earnings call, which analysts interpreted as a sign that the market is mildly freaked out about how much money the company is plowing into AI infrastructure. ("The vibe is cautious," TheTradable reported.) The companies were a little vague about how much revenue they're actually bringing in from AI, or how they expect to make money from it. Zuckerberg, defending the vast sums Meta is pouring into its data centers, unwittingly summed up the uncertain mood when he said that this kind of infrastructure spending "is very likely to be a profitable thing over … over some period." Pretty bad, man! On paper, at least, the ungodly sums AI companies are spending on their infrastructure are propping up the American economy almost single-handedly. In the first half of 2025, spending on data centers accounted for most of the economic growth in the U.S., outpacing all consumer spending combined. (You'll see this reported in ways that make it sound as if the economy is being bolstered by the money AI companies are making, but no, it's the money they're spending that's relevant.) On the other hand, "on paper" may not be the best way to understand the state of the U.S. economy right now. It's been widely observed that many regular people feel the economy is bad, while economists, when they look at the numbers, say it's relatively strong. This disparity is probably in part because, on paper, Meta dumping a thousand trillion dollars into a Death Star–sized “superintelligence lab” with 11 employees in rural Idaho boosts the numbers, but in reality, Zuckerberg's real estate binges have a limited effect on conditions outside the semi-closed loop of the AI industry. (This may be especially true now that private equity funds are getting involved in data center financing.) Groceries are getting more expensive. Utilities are getting more expensive. Thanks to the Trump tariffs, almost everything we buy is getting more expensive. None of that is offset by AI investment, and if AI investment stopped tomorrow, the immediate impact on many people's daily lives might be less than you'd expect. That also applies to, as you might guess, non-AI businesses, many of which are also struggling. Many have scrambled to incorporate AI into their operations, drawn by the promise of a technology that would cut labor costs and revolutionize productivity. Yet according to an MIT study released in August, 95 percent of businesses that have deployed generative AI have gotten no value from it. It's not clear that the AI bubble bursting would have a devastating effect on them either, at least directly. Indirectly, of course, things look quite different. A sharp contraction in tech would put tens of thousands of people out of work, vaporize trillions of investment dollars, torpedo retirement and education funds, obliterate life savings, and ruin lives. It would be a violent shock to a system that's already under strain. Of course, one of the reasons the economy is under strain is the massive concentration of wealth in the hands of a small number of oligarchs, and those same oligarchs would like to use AI to replace the human labor force—likely putting tens of thousands of people out of work, vaporizing non-oligarchic wealth, obliterating savings, etc. It may be better for the world for the bubble to pop, whatever damage is done. For now, though, we are living in the storytelling economy. As long as the shared fantasy of the AI industry holds Silicon Valley and its investors in thrall, the reckoning can be deferred. And in the meantime, who knows? Maybe the bubble will never pop. Maybe the people who've sold the fantasy can figure out how to keep us believing long enough for someone to create it, or at least to dream up a new one and hope we don't notice the difference. It's bitterly funny, though, that up until now, some of the biggest victims of AI companies have been the artists, writers, actors, and filmmakers whose creative work the companies want to cannibalize and replace. The industry has shown nothing but contempt for narrative art that speaks to the human imagination—the very thing that's keeping it alive.

Title: 10 Proven Vacation Rental Marketing Ideas for 2025 (That Actually Drive Bookings)

Time Published: 2025-11-12T05:43:24Z

Get our Design Ideas in your inbox! Sign up U.S. short-term-rental demand jumped about seven percent in 2024, yet supply lagged—so every booking now counts. Travelers still crave one-of-a-kind stays, which means generic marketing won’t cut it. That’s why we built this playbook. It ranks ten battle-tested tactics by impact, cost, and effort. Each move works on a lean budget, scales from a single cabin to 50 condos, and typically pays for itself within 90 days. Pick the tactic that matches your goals, layer on the rest, and keep your 2025 calendar packed. U.S. short-term-rental demand climbed seven percent in 2024, while active listings grew about five percent, a gap wide enough to keep rates healthy yet narrow enough to sharpen competition. (help.airdna.co) According to AirDNA, the supply surge that began during the pandemic is still visible. Non-professional hosts saw occupancy dip to roughly 54 percent in early 2024 before edging back toward 55 percent by mid-2025—evidence that guests now have more choice. Statista projects vacation-rental revenue to exceed about $105 billion in 2025. With demand still outrunning new supply in many drive-to markets, you can secure a larger slice without overspending, a theme we explore next. Rental-industry analysts at Rental Scale-Up note that Airbnb’s search model now weighs more than 800 signals and puts extra weight on booking probability plus guest-satisfaction cues such as transparent fees and replies in under an hour. Vrbo and Booking.com are rolling out similar quality-score updates that lift listings most likely to convert. Across U.S. markets, one in four reservations now lands within five days of arrival, down from one in six in 2022, AirDNA data show. Remote workers and multigenerational groups often decide mid-week and travel the same weekend, so outdated minimum-stay or pricing rules can leave revenue on the table. Two- to four-bedroom homes sit in the sweet spot for last-minute demand, and large groups now feel comfortable booking a 10-person getaway just two weeks out, according to AirDNA’s STR Data Lab podcast. Expect jagged occupancy patterns instead of tidy week-long blocks. New York City’s Local Law 18 blocks OTAs from processing reservations at unregistered homes, cutting thousands of listings since full enforcement began in September 2023. In Dallas, a 2023 ban on short-term rentals in single-family zones remains on hold after a 2025 appeals-court decision, creating a patchwork of “allowed but unsettled” neighborhoods. If you watch these moving parts and adjust pricing, policies, and marketing in real time, you stay visible. Coast, and you risk vanishing from search and local maps. We started with four must-haves. To rank each idea, we built a Priority Score: Impact × 2 – Cost – Difficulty. We then color-coded the results (green 🟢, amber 🟡, red 🔴) so you can adjust weights to fit your goals and skills. With the scorecard set, the first idea shows why professional marketing help can secure more nights on the calendar. Great marketing depends on three scarce resources: time, technology, and continuous tuning. When you already juggle guest messages, turnovers, and repairs, outsourcing growth to a professional team can free up evenings and lift revenue. Full-service vacation-rental managers bundle multi-channel distribution, dynamic pricing, and professional photography. SkyRun Vacation Rentals manages thousands of homes across North America’s most-loved destinations and uses centralized systems to publish one listing to Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and Google while syncing calendars and adjusting rates as demand shifts. Their centralized systems publish one listing to Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and Google, sync calendars, and adjust rates as demand shifts. AirDNA reports that managed listings earned 15–20 percent more revenue year over year than comparable self-hosted homes, comfortably covering a typical 20 percent commission. Real-world proof: an AirDNA case study found that Phoenix-area manager Venture REI used data-driven pricing and wider channel reach to raise one owner’s occupancy from 72 percent to 92 percent in a single quarter. If you consider a partner, vet them the way guests vet you. Ask for transparent performance reports, local market knowledge, and clear service tiers. A good manager works like a revenue coach, sharing data that shows exactly how each booking reaches your bank account. Property type + standout feature + key amenity + location cue Example: Lakefront cabin w/ private dock, dog-friendly. Clear language earns the click. AirDNA’s content review shows that listings between 250 and 350 words convert 12 percent better than very short or very long blurbs. Guide readers from arrival to bedtime, weaving in sensory details plus quick answers on parking, Wi-Fi speed, and fees. Update photos each season, adjust the title for local events, and trim outdated lines. Frequent edits nudge you up in search results and signal care to returning guests. Relying on one OTA is like putting all your savings in a single stock; one algorithm tweak or city rule can cut cash flow overnight. A multi-channel plan spreads risk and reaches new demand. Travelnest reports that hosts who diversify beyond their primary site gain up to 30 percent more bookings year-round. Different sites reach different travelers: A channel manager such as Rentals United or Guesty for Hosts syncs rates, rules, and availability in real time. That prevents double bookings and lets you fine-tune prices by channel. One Rentals United case study recorded a 40 percent lift in occupancy after expanding to new channels with automated sync. Aim for the big four—Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, Google—plus one or two niche or regional sites that match your ideal guest. Keep photos, pricing, and policies consistent to build trust with travelers and search algorithms, and you stay visible even if one platform stumbles. Major OTAs keep 10–15 percent of every reservation as commission. Airbnb’s host-only fee rises to 15.5 percent for software-connected listings in October 2025, and Booking.com already averages about 15 percent. That slice of revenue disappears, and you also lose the guest’s email, upsell options, and control over ranking. A direct path on your own site flips the math. You keep the commission, own the contact list, and shield your business from sudden policy changes that can freeze an OTA account. Pass part of the saved fee back to travelers—a five-percent lower nightly rate or free early check-in—and you stay cheaper than your OTA listing while pocketing the same margin. TouchStay notes that hosts who convert just 20 percent of stays to direct save thousands in annual fees, smoothing seasonality and trimming ad spend over time. Think of your site as the property’s digital front door. It needs only four elements: Most hosts launch a direct site through their property-management system or a WordPress template. Connect Stripe or Square, upload professional photos, and you can go live in a weekend. Next, publish two evergreen blog posts that solve travel-planning headaches—“Best kid-friendly hikes near Gatlinburg” or “Where to park for Mardi Gras.” End each post with a soft “check availability” link. Finally, reward past guests for booking direct: offer a five-percent repeat-stay discount or free late checkout in your post-departure email. Small perks chip away at OTA dependence with every return visit. Static nightly rates are guesses. Dynamic pricing tools track live signals such as local events, competitor rates, and booking windows, then refresh prices every day. Rates rise the moment a festival sells out and drop mid-week to keep occupancy steady. Getting started is simple. Connect a service like PriceLabs, Wheelhouse, or Beyond, set your floor and stretch targets, and let the algorithm handle the dials. Beyond users report 10–15 percent higher annual revenue after switching from manual pricing. The lift shows up two ways: average daily rate climbs on peak nights, while occupancy improves in shoulder seasons when the tool lowers prices to capture last-minute stays. Review your pricing calendar weekly to spot odd spikes, and adjust minimum-stay rules to two nights in low season and three or four when demand is high to balance turnover costs. With pricing on autopilot, you can focus on guest experience instead of spreadsheets and out-earn neighbors who still set one price and hope for the best. New guests cost money, whether it’s commissions, ads, or hours of messaging. Past guests cost almost nothing. Hostfully’s 2024 Hospitality Report shows that repeat guests generate 33 percent higher lifetime value and need 50 percent less marketing spend. Staying in their inbox keeps that value flowing. Build the list on checkout day. Export the reservation, tag it “opt-in,” and drop the address into a free platform such as Mailchimp. Email once a quarter. TouchStay recommends quarterly cadence for short-term rentals; more frequent sends feel spammy when travelers book only once or twice a year. Highlight one upgrade (new firepit), two local events, and an early-bird deal, such as 10 percent off spring dates booked by February. Segment for relevance. Families who stayed in July care about school-break deals; remote workers from November want winter monthly rates. Most PMS tools auto-label stays by party size and season, so filtering takes minutes. Add a loyalty hook. “Book direct next time and enjoy free early check-in” costs nothing most days and signals VIP status. Track perks in a spreadsheet and deliver on arrival; 64 percent of operators already use special offers to secure repeat stays. Stack these quick emails to stay top of mind, fill shoulder-season gaps, and cut dependence on paid channels. Travel dreaming starts on phones long before it reaches Google. Forty percent of leisure travelers say social media sparks their trip ideas, and Guesty notes that listings for a well-prepared vacation rental property with an active feed earn 37 percent more bookings than silent ones. The cost is mostly your time, not cash. Pick one or two channels that match your audience. Instagram reels wow couples searching “best sunset Airbnb,” Facebook still guides multigenerational planners, and TikTok’s travel hashtag passed 40 billion views in 2025. Post twice a week: one glossy shot and one slice-of-life clip, such as marshmallows toasting at your firepit or a five-second dawn timelapse on the lake. Guest photos bring built-in trust. Encourage tags, reshare with a thank-you, and add a gentle direct-booking link. Over time your feed turns into a gallery of real memories future guests can picture themselves in. Need a faster boost? Team up with a micro-influencer who fits your locale, perhaps a regional food blogger or adaptive-travel creator. Offer a mid-week comp night and list clear deliverables: one post, one story, usage rights. For owners who’d rather outsource the whole social-media and ad-buying lift, this guide to vacation-rental marketing services breaks down what a specialist agency can handle—from photo shoots to multi-channel campaigns—so you can scale visibility without adding hours to your schedule. Focused audiences beat celebrity scatter and often cost less than one vacant night. Social will not replace OTAs, but it widens the funnel and supplies fresh visuals for your website and listings, content that keeps working long after the likes fade. Reviews do more than reassure travelers; they push you higher in search results. Airbnb factors ratings volume and recency into ranking, while Vrbo’s new “Loved by Guests” badge lifts homes with 9.4-plus average scores and verified photo reviews. Yet Airbnb data show that fewer than half of guests leave a review unless you prompt them. Ask quickly and personally. Send a text within 24 hours of checkout that mentions one detail from the stay: “Glad the kids loved the game room!” Then make the request. Guesty reports that personalized prompts raise review rates by 30 percent over generic automations. Fix first, then ask. Resolve any issue before requesting feedback; future guests judge how you handle hiccups as much as the hiccup itself. Showcase micro-quotes. Drop three-word gems such as “spotlessly clean” or “views for days” into your listing description, website hero copy, and social captions. Snippets deliver social proof where star icons do not appear. Expand the footprint. After an OTA review posts, invite guests to paste the same text on Google Business Profile or Facebook. More review sites mean more pathways for search engines—and travelers—to reach you. Over time, plentiful, authentic feedback becomes the moat that keeps competitors at bay. Organic reach goes far, yet some nights still need a paid boost, such as mid-week gaps or shoulder-season lulls. Hyper-targeted ads place your listing in front of travelers already hunting for the dates you must fill, and you can pause spend once the gap is gone. A Google campaign around “pet-friendly cabin Blue Ridge” shows only to people typing those words. WordStream’s 2024 Google Ads benchmark report indicates travel-sector CPCs average $1.92 and convert at 6–8 percent. Meta lets you filter by interests, income, and even relationship status, so a beach condo can pitch “babymoon getaway” packages to expectant parents within a four-hour drive. The same benchmark data put Facebook’s travel CPC at about $0.51, and retargeting nudges yesterday’s site visitors toward tomorrow’s bookings. Channel Best use case Avg. CPC Key metric Google Search High-intent gaps under 30 days $1.90 Cost per booking Meta (FB/IG) Awareness and retargeting $0.51 View-through bookings TikTok Visual, younger audience $0.80–$1.20* Video watch rate *Early-2025 TikTok Travel advertisers report sub-$1 CPCs in U.S. drive-to markets (internal ad-network data). Start small at about $10 a day, one campaign, and one audience. Send clicks to your direct-booking page so the first stay covers the ad and future stays arrive commission-free. If a channel fails to return at least three times its cost, pause it and test a new angle. Paid ads should regulate cash flow smoothly, not drain it. Use CRM tags to spot work-from-anywhere guests and email a remote-ready bundle: verified 300 Mbps Wi-Fi, spare monitor, mid-stay cleaning. For families, swap in a stroller rental and a map of free playgrounds. Speaking each guest’s language turns price into a footnote and fuels glowing reviews. Partner with a local yoga teacher for sunrise deck sessions or stock s’mores kits plus a star map at the firepit. TouchStay’s 2024 Guest Sentiment Report shows that low-cost add-ons lift review scores by 0.3 stars on average. Higher ratings feed the algorithm and justify a modest rate bump no neighbor can copy overnight. Block one afternoon each month to activate a new AI feature, send a segment-specific email, or test a micro-experience. Track bookings or review scores for 30 days. Keep what moves the needle, drop what does not. Guests feel the momentum, algorithms reward relevance, and your calendar fills while others cling to last year’s checklist.

Title: Nvidia Stock Lurches Down as SoftBank Pulls Entire Investment
URL: http://futurism.com/future-society/nvidia-stock-softbank-ai
Time Published: 2025-11-11T19:46:37Z
Full Content:
By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 11, 2025 2:46 PM EST Last month, we shared a story about Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg, who defied the odds as the only voice out of 80 Bloomberg stock watchers who rated Nvidia as a “sell.” While Goldberg makes some very good points — mostly, that AI simply isn’t proficient enough, at least yet, to justify its incredible chokehold on the US economy — the consensus on Wall Street has been firmly against him. Case in point, even after Goldberg made his assessment in the last week of October, investors continued to dump money into Nvidia, which is seen as the “shovel merchant” to the AI goldrush. So much money, in fact, that the company’s market cap briefly shot up above $5 trillion — the first company in history to do so. All that is to say, conventional wisdom is that you’d be nuts to pull an investment in Nvidia right now. Yet that’s exactly what Japanese investment firm SoftBank did on Tuesday, sending numerous tech stocks into a slide. According to Bloomberg, SoftBank disclosed it was pulling its $5.8 billion worth of holdings in Nvidia early Tuesday morning, ending its reign as one of the chip giant’s most prominent backers. The news immediately sent shockwaves throughout the market, dragging Nvidia’s stock down by around 2.6 percent as of Tuesday afternoon. As if to show how codependent the AI industry is, other tech giants were dragged down too, with stock in companies like Tesla falling by 1.8 percent, Meta by 0.95 percent, and Intel around 0.9 percent. Overall, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index was down by 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 struggled to maintain a flatline. Overall, it would be awful news for the AI industry if it wasn’t for one little wrinkle: SoftBank is planning on using its previous Nvidia holdings to back OpenAI, the private company behind ChatGPT. It’s already given OpenAI $7.5 billion, with plans for another $22.5 billion soon, as Bloomberg reports. In other words, don’t be shocked if the sell-off evens out in the coming days, as Yahoo Finance suggests. That said, there is at least one lesson to take away from the episode. While most other tech stocks tumbled, Apple soared by over 1.5 percent, its share price reaching an all-time high of $273.53. This is despite a disappointing announcement on Monday that the tech giant was delaying the release of the next iPhone Air in 2026. So what gives? When you peel back the “big tech” trappings, Apple stands out as the largest tech corporation to maintain ambivalence about the AI boom. Back in June, Apple’s research lab dropped a bombshell paper calling out companies like OpenAI for selling “the illusion of thinking” in AI chatbots. Apple has increasingly downplayed any efforts at building out a proprietary AI model, after early attempts failed rather spectacularly. All in all, don’t count on Apple to weather the storm completely if the entire AI bubble begins to pop, but when it comes to the touch-and-go volatility of the AI news cycle, the company might just have the last laugh.

Title: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/massive-liquidity-coming-for-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T17:00:28Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Investor angst over Big Tech’s AI spending spills into bond market

Investors have been selling off the debt of US tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley’s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market. A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks. The spread, or premium in yield that investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since US president Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data. The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure would cost more than $5 trillion (€4.3 trillion) and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”. The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns about overcapacity, long-term profitability and energy demands. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of more than $350 billion this year. Tech groups are issuing debt at a quick rate to fund their AI expansion efforts despite having large cash hoards, which is something some investors worry could signal a shift to higher levels of leverage. “The hyperscalers collectively hold [about] $350 billion in liquid cash and investments and are expected to generate [roughly] $725 billion of operating cash flow in 2026,” JPMorgan said. “Even so, substantial new debt supply is coming to the credit markets from these high-quality issuers.” In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle have hit markets with blockbuster debt packages, some with maturities as long as 40 years. Meta last month forged a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to fund development of its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. It raised an additional $30 billion in bonds at the end of October, the biggest corporate bond deal since 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet sold $25 billion of bonds in early November, $17.5 billion of which were raised in the US and $7.5 billion in Europe. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Analysts noted Oracle’s debt has been hit particularly hard in recent months. An index compiled by the Financial Times tracking its debt that has been trading since before the latest bond sale has fallen almost 5 per cent since mid-September, compared with a price fall of about 1 per cent for a broad Ice Data Services basket tracking US high-grade tech debt. Oracle has about $96 billion of long-term debt, according to Bloomberg data. It has rapidly grown its debt balances as part of a series of deals to lease computing power to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the US software group said would generate $300 billion in revenue over the next five years. But credit rating agency Moody’s has flagged significant risks from Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its growth. Smaller companies at the heart of the AI boom have also been hit. Data centre operator CoreWeave’s stock has fallen more than 20 per cent over the past two weeks, alongside the drop in bigger names. On Tuesday, the company’s shares were down a further 14 per cent after it lowered its forecast for annual revenue as a result of expected data centre delays. The cost to protect against a default on CoreWeave’s debt has jumped as the equity price has fallen, with the group’s five-year credit default swaps trading at 505 basis points, from below 350bp at the start of October, according to LSEG data. Some analysts argue that the decline in hyperscalers’ bonds in the wake of such large issuance is healthy. “As long as we are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. The thing I worry about is a rally on more supply rather than a sell-off,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “We’re still in early innings in this debt cycle for AI,” he said.

Title: Nvidia’s $500 Billion Surge Meets a Wall of Doubt | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as the AI trade takes another wild turn. Nvidia’s $500 billion rebound has the market buzzing again, but behind the headlines, old believers are cashing out and skeptics are circling. Euphoria is back, but so are the warning signs. Nvidia’s record-breaking rebound has reignited the AI trade, adding half a trillion dollars in market value within just two trading days. Yet beneath the euphoria, major investors are pulling back, and the warnings are getting louder. On Monday, Nvidia shares surged 5.8%, marking their largest daily gain since April. Between midday Friday and Monday’s close, the chipmaker added roughly $500 billion in market capitalization, equivalent to $43 billion per trading hour. 💥BREAKING:NVIDIA SURGES BY 5.8% IN TODAY'S TRADING, ITS BIGGEST DAILY GAIN SINCE APRIL. pic.twitter.com/LFzsEOxUNI The rally came after a bruising week in which Nvidia had lost nearly $800 billion in value, highlighting how swiftly capital is rotating in and out of the AI trade. “Nvidia added $500 billion in market cap in just 48 hours — entries into this historic run are scarce,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote. “Dip buyers are still out in full force.” At a $5.1 trillion valuation, Nvidia now represents 8.5% of the S&P 500. This is larger than the sum of six of the index’s 11 sectors, including Materials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Its market cap also exceeds the combined value of the entire stock markets of Italy, Spain, the UAE, and the Netherlands. While retail investors continue to chase Nvidia’s ascent, SoftBank has quietly exited. The Japanese conglomerate sold its entire $5.83 billion Nvidia stake in October, alongside part of its $9.17 billion T-Mobile holding, as part of a strategy it called “asset monetization.” JUST IN: SoftBank announces it has sold its entire stake in $NVDA for $5.8 billion. pic.twitter.com/9qSOxkZXjd The sales helped SoftBank report a ¥2.92 trillion ($19.1 billion) second-quarter profit, more than double last year’s, powered by $19 billion in Vision Fund gains largely tied to its OpenAI holdings. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split and raised its interim dividend as CEO Masayoshi Son reaffirmed SoftBank’s “all-in” commitment to artificial intelligence, robotics, and data infrastructure. SoftBank’s Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said the sales were meant to ensure “safe funding” as the firm prepares to deploy more than $30 billion in fresh investments this quarter. “We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities while maintaining financial strength,” TradFi media reported, citing Goto. However, not everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Michael Burry, famed for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, warned that hyperscalers and cloud giants may be artificially inflating earnings by extending the “useful life” of compute equipment. In doing so, they allegedly reduce reported depreciation on AI infrastructure purchased from Nvidia and other suppliers. Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings -one of the more common frauds of the modern era.Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful… pic.twitter.com/h0QkktMeUB Burry estimated $176 billion in understated depreciation between 2026 and 2028, which he claims could overstate profits at companies like Oracle and Meta by 27% and 21%, respectively. Against these backdrops,some analysts warn that the math behind the AI boom does not add up. Ross Hendricks noted that to justify current AI valuations, global revenues would need to rise 20x in five years, or else capital expenditure would need to “collapse,” triggering a broad market correction. The AI math ain’t mathin Two ways to fix it: 20x revenue in the next five years, or slash data center capexI’ll take the latter on 100 to 1 oddsSo what does a capex pullback look like? It means hyperscaler cloud computing earnings and NVDA chip sales evaporate.. and with… https://t.co/eI4HIIczTZ Even so, momentum remains unstoppable, for now. Nvidia has become the defining stock of the AI era, its chips powering everything from data centers to large language models like OpenAI’s GPT series. Yet the contrasting moves by SoftBank and warnings from Burry suggest the market’s biggest winner could soon face its toughest test.

Title: Warren Buffett’s last shareholder letter offers 5 lessons for CEOs and warns that ‘envy and greed walk hand in hand’

As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. celebrates Veteran’s Day today, and we are sending a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has served. Speaking of gratitude, Warren Buffett dropped his ‘farewell’ letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday and offered a master class in introspection, recognizing his own good luck, and passing on sage advice. I’d highly recommend reading the letter in its entirety, but here are a few lessons for leaders I think are worth underscoring: Curb Your Envy: “What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?” Learn From Failure: “Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes—learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” Measure Success Through Impact: “Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.” Ponder Your Legacy: Buffett talks about how FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, once revered by Americans in the 1930s, “became disgraced for misusing his post.” His advice: “Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it … You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.” Bet on America: “Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Softbank offloads Nvidia Softbank on Tuesday sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia, pocketing $5.8 billion in a surprise move. Masayoshi Son’s company more than doubled its quarterly net profit thanks in large part to its bet on OpenAI. Shutdown may ease A splinter group of Democrats joined Senate Republicans in passing a measure to reopen the government on Monday night. The legislation now goes to the House, which is expected to take it up no later than Wednesday. Meanwhile, flight cancellations and delays spread amid a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay. President Trump on Monday threatened to “dock” the pay of any controllers who take time off. CoreWeave results AI data-center and infrastructure operator CoreWeave nearly doubled its revenue backlog to $55.6 billion, surpassing a critical Wall Street benchmark, though its debt increased and it revised down its full-year revenue guidance. Investors are following CoreWeave closely since it could be “a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up,” Fortune’s Amanda Gerut reports. Turmoil at the BBC The crisis at the BBC deepened on Monday after President Trump threatened to sue the broadcaster for $1 billion over the erroneous editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. Two BBC executives have already resigned over the matter; the president has demanded an apology and compensation for “harm caused.” The real cost of Trump’s tariff dividend President Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff dividend for all Americans (excluding “high income people”) will cost more than twice the revenue generated by tariffs, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The extra cost would have to be added to the already ballooning federal deficit. UBS economists’ labor market concerns UBS economists in their latest “US Economics Weekly” note compared the national labor market to a bathtub that is losing water (total jobs) as layoffs persist and the flow of jobs slows. “That is a material risk to the outlook,” the investment bank wrote.
