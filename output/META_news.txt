As someone who’s been working as a shopping editor for over six years, I’ve come to know the ins and outs of Prime Day—from spotting genuinely good deals (and avoiding the bad ones) to predicting which products will sell out the fastest. For the first time ever, the sale will span four days, which means stock on popular items may be even more limited than years past. To help you find the best Prime Day deals on day one, I’ve curated a list of hot-ticket items expected to be among the first to go, including the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects and the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, both of which are at all-time low prices. These are the 10 Prime Day deals our deals editor predicts will sell out on day one. If you come across my curated list a little late (these products do tend to sell out quickly), I recommend heading straight to Amazon’s “Today’s Big Deals” or “Lightning Deals” sections. That’s where you’ll find the steepest markdowns on hundreds of buzz-worthy items. In any case, check out all my editor-approved Prime Day deals for day one before stock runs out. Amazon Any product with a viral following tends to sell out fast during Prime Day—and this Stanley tumbler is one of them. For context, every time the cup is released in a new colorway, stock typically runs out in minutes. So the fact that it’s majorly discounted right now leads me to believe it’ll fly off the shelves before the day (or even next hour) is over. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price it’s ever dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Year after year, the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask proves to be a top-seller during Prime Day. If you’re already hooked on its buttery-soft, hydrating formula, this is a good time to stock up. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the standard discount we’ve seen during Prime Day in the past. Amazon These whitening strips are another hot commodity during Prime Day—we often see thousands of boxes sell during the sale event. They’re also a team favorite, earning a spot in our shopping guide for the best teeth whitening kits. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. Amazon Prime Day is a great opportunity to find steep discounts on popular smartwatch models, like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Track your fitness routine, curate better sleep habits and monitor key stats like energy level and heart rate, all from this sleek design. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price the smartwatch has dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Similar to Stanley, Yeti is a popular brand shoppers flock to during major sale events. While plenty of Yeti designs are marked down right now, this portable cooler will come in especially handy during summer—whether you’re lounging at the park or heading to the beach. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the first time this Yeti cooler has gone on sale at Amazon. Amazon If you’ve got your eye on electronics from top brands, it’s best to check out sooner rather than later. These Bluetooth headphones are a frequent best-seller on Amazon—over 2,000 pairs were sold in the last month alone—so they’ll likely go quickly while they’re discounted to an all-time low price. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the best deal we’ve ever spotted on the earbuds at Amazon. Amazon In all my years covering Prime Day, I’ve noticed Apple AirPods 2 (alongside other models from the brand) are always among the first to sell out. It’s no surprise—they’re a staple for Apple users, whether they’re upgrading from an older model or replacing a lost pair. Why It’s A Good Deal: This price is $10 cheaper than what we saw over Black Friday. Amazon Nearly all sizes of the Samsung Frame TV—32-inch, 43-inch, 50-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch—are currently sitting at all-time low prices. This is a rare opportunity to finally splurge on the chic, smart TV—there’s no telling when it will go on sale again (or sell out). Why It’s A Good Deal: These are the best discounts we’ve ever come across on this smart TV. Amazon LED face masks are an investment, so it’s often wise to bide your time until a major sale event arrives. The HigherDose Red Light Therapy Face Mask is one of the more popular designs out there—and our top pick for the best LED face mask for comfort. It combines red and near-infrared light to target signs of aging, dullness and uneven tone. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the typical discount we’ve spotted during major sale events, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon While it might not seem like the steepest markdown at first glance, the Meta Quest 3 hardly ever goes on sale, making this a rare chance to snag the popular virtual reality device. This Amazon-exclusive Cardboard Hero bundle includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor and 1,000 shiny rocks to use in the Gorilla Tag game. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price this MetaQuest 3 bundle has dropped to at Amazon.

US stock market started the week on a weak note as Dow Jones fell 160 points after President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Bangladesh. The market dip deepened as Tesla shares plunged 7% following Elon Musk’s America Party announcement. Futures for Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq also dropped further on Tuesday. Meanwhile, uncertainty around trade deals with India and the European Union and rising US Dollar index added to the pressure. With the new tariffs set to take effect on August 1, investors remain cautious. Read full story for detailed updates.

The Verge’s favorite deals from Amazon’s four-day sales event, from earbuds and video games to robot vacuums and more. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Day one of Prime Day is in the books. The good news? Almost all of the great deals survived the night, and we’re monitoring them all right here in our Prime Day day two post. As such, the post below will no longer be updated. Prime Day, Amazon’s four-day thunderdome of exclusive deals, is here. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be the best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing them down to include products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for. To repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible. The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. Read our review. The latest pair of Beats earbuds are a no-brainer for athletes. They pack fantastic sound and thumping bass, along with active noise cancellation, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. Read our review. Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones, which replace the QuietComfort 45, have adjustable noise cancellation and the ability to set custom modes. However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Samsung’s premium Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sport the same stem-based design and pinch gestures as the standard Galaxy Buds 3, only they deliver better sound, improved ANC, and an in-ear fit with silicone tips. Read our review. Sony’s last-last-gen ANC headphones still offer great sound, last up to 30 hours on a single charge, and provide a comfortable listening experience thanks to their plush ear pads. Read our review. The Beats Studio Buds Plus offer better sound and noise cancellation than the original pair, and they now come in a unique translucent color option. Read our review. Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. Read our impressions. Shokz’ best bone conduction headphones yet, with more booming bass than its predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review. A Qi2 pad on the front and a party in the back, with three AC outlets and four USB ports. It can deliver up to 67W through a single USB-C port or divided between its two USB-C and two USB-A ports. Anker’s jack-of-all-trades travel adapter packs enough ports to refill your devices during some downtime. It features one AC outlet, two USB-C ports (one tops out at 20W), and two USB-A ports. It’s not the fastest wall charger, but it’s a solid choice when you can find it at a discount. Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. The charger includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its five-foot / 1.5m USB cable. A compact, flexible Qi2 charger for vent and dash mounting. Read our review. Baseus’ slick USB-C charger supports 100W passthrough and takes a puck-like form when not in use, with male connectors on either side that retract inward with a quick tug. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s thinner and lighter than its predecessors, yet it charges faster and features the same fitness and wellness features. Read our review. The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review. Google’s new Pixel Watch 3 is bigger and brighter than its predecessor. It also features more advanced running capabilities, offline Google Maps functionality, and deeper integration with other Google devices. Read our review. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is targeted at more outdoorsy folks with dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, and increased durability. Read our review. The Oura Ring 4 is slimmer and more accurate than its predecessor, while adding new AI-powered tools and longer battery life. Read our review. The Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment. Read our review. The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen. It lacks built-in GPS, contactless payments, and digital assistants, but offers a range of other excellent health and fitness tracking features. Read our impressions. Google’s Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display than its predecessor, along with a Tensor G4 processor, a bigger battery, 12GB of RAM, and a dual rear camera setup with a new 48-megapixel sensor for its ultrawide. Read our review. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an eight-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold. The new foldable also lies flat when opened, sports IPX8 weather resistance, and offers a thinner design than the last-gen model. Read our review. The OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price. Read our review. The Galaxy S25 Edge offers a big screen without all the heft of a typical big phone. Battery life is just okay, and the phone lacks a telephoto camera, but otherwise, it’s a remarkable device. Read our review. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is still one of the best phones you can buy, even if its “Ultra”-ness is a little diminished. Two telephotos, a built-in stylus, and a big screen are the main attractions. Read our review. The Galaxy A35 5G comes with a good 6.6-inch OLED panel, a robust IP67 dust and water resistance rating, and a strong software update policy for its class. The standard Moto Razr features a 6.9-inch inner screen, accompanied by a larger 3.6-inch cover screen. Wired charging tops out at 30W, compared to the Razr Plus’ 45W, although it features 15W wireless charging, up from 5W on the previous model. Read our review. The MacBook Air is Apple’s budget-friendly laptop from 2020. It comes outfitted with the company’s M1 chip, which offers terrific performance, even if it’s not as fast as Apple’s newer models. It also sports all-day battery life, Touch ID, and MagSafe charging. Read our review. The latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence. Unlike its predecessor, the base model now offers 16GB RAM by default, along with a new 12-megapixel webcam. Read our review. Microsoft’s latest Surface Pro is smaller, with a new design and updated keyboard. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Arm64 Snapdragon X Plus chip. Read our review. The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Read our review. The new 11-inch iPad Air comes with Apple’s M3 chip and GPU upgrades. It’s available in dark gray, blue, purple, and a “starlight” cream shade. Read our review. Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus with 64GB of storage is $139.99 (originally $219.99), beating its previous best price of $149. Despite its low price, the Tab A9 Plus retains a high-end look, and its 11-inch screen makes it a great option for watching movies and TV shows. The Boox Palma 2 is a 6.3-inch smartphone-sized e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more. Read our review. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display. It also boasts 32GB of storage, waterproofing, and support for wireless charging. Read our review. Google’s 11-inch Pixel Tablet uses the same Tensor G2 chip found in the Pixel 7 lineup. It also features a crisp LCD display and a four-speaker sound array. Read our review. Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review. Google’s excellent TV Streamer 4K is its best attempt at a streaming device yet, offering built-in ethernet along with smart home compatibility with Matter and Thread. Read our review. Amazon’s latest streaming stick is faster than its predecessor with Wi-Fi 6E and double the storage. It also now displays widgets and artwork when idle while continuing to offer Alexa integration. LG’s B4 might be one of the cheapest OLED TVs available, but it still offers plenty of bang for your buck — including four HDMI 2.1 ports, speedy performance, and five years’ worth of webOS updates. TCL’s Mini LED QLED TV is a great value, particularly for those who want a fast frame rate and a bright picture. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate, features two HDMI 2.1 ports, and supports Google TV’s robust software. Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV uses an anti-glare matte QLED display, which can showcase artwork and photos with canvas-like quality when idle. Bargain hunters seeking a large, yet reasonably priced, 65-inch OLED TV should consider Samsung’s S85D. It’s Samsung’s entry-level model, though you still get HDMI 2.1 ports, 4K resolution at 120Hz with consoles, and a variable refresh rate. iFFALCON’s slim-bezeled mural TV takes after Samsung’s Frame TV, but costs significantly less. The TCL sub-brand’s TV sports an art mode and several high-end features, including a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price. This ultrawide (21:9) QHD OLED gaming monitor has a 165Hz refresh rate, a fast response time, and a slick design. It’s tough to get more OLED for your money than with this model when it’s discounted. The newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera. It features Amazon’s smart voice assistant for voice control and is worthy of a spot on your nightstand. Read our review. If you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does. It’s simple, smart, and works on anything with a button. Stick it on the device you want to turn on or off, and you’re set. The newest Echo Show 5 is just as small as its predecessor but features updated mics and a speaker system that delivers double the bass and clearer sound quality. Meross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. Developed in partnership with Resideo, the Amazon Smart Thermostat allows you to control the temperature of your home through Alexa voice controls and remotely via an app. Read our review. The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro delivers high-quality video with adjustable, accurate radar-powered motion detection, 2,000 lumens of light, and a good digital zoom. It offers smart alerts for people or motion and works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Ring’s excellent app. This is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features. The fifth-gen Echo Dot touts a temperature sensor, better sound, and faster response time than the prior model. It can also act as an extender for your Eero Wi-Fi system. Read our review. Amazon’s apt-titled Smart Plug doesn’t require a hub and lets you add Alexa functionality to any outlet, allowing you to control a range of devices with just your voice. These smart lights have beautiful colors, a nice selection of festive scenes, and an easy-to-use app. They are super reliable when paired with a Hue Bridge and also work over Bluetooth. They come in two lengths, work with all the major smart home platforms, and are Matter-compatible. With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop which is why it’s our top pick overall. It features Roborock’s best obstacle avoidance, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice. With a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach. The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities. Our favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock. The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services. Read our review. Vizio’s Elevate SE is a budget-friendly alternative to its high-end Elevate soundbar. It still features many of the same highlights, though, including booming sound quality and rotating speakers that provide the verticality required for Dolby Atmos content. Ultimate Ears’ latest disc-shaped Bluetooth speaker is small and affordable, with a built-in strap for attaching it to your belongings. It also charges via USB-C and features an IP67 rating against dust and water, along with up to 12 hours of battery life. The last-gen JBL Go 3 may not be quite as powerful as larger models in JBL’s current lineup, but it remains a great pool-ready Bluetooth speaker that can fit in your pocket. If you’ve ever wanted a Bluetooth speaker that looks like a guitar amp, Marshall’s Acton III is one of the best. It’s got tactile switches and knobs out the wazoo, letting you fine-tune the bass and treble, along with the option to plug in a 3.5mm source or use Bluetooth for playback. The WiiM Mini makes it easy to wirelessly stream music from your phone, a streaming service, or other local storage to existing speakers you already have. It supports AirPlay 2 and a variety of streaming services. Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. Read our review. The JBL Authentics 300 is one of only a few smart speakers on the market with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The ’70s-style speaker is heavy, but it produces impressive, powerful sound, especially at louder volumes. Read our review. Star Wars Outlaws is an original open-world adventure set in the vast universe of the iconic film series. It stars Kay Vess, a protagonist looking to steal from criminal overlords to gain her freedom. A new expansion featuring Lando Calrissian recently launched, alongside an update that improves stealth and some of the game’s most glaring issues. Read our review. Princess Zelda’s first solo adventure as a playable character tasks her with saving her people, including Link, who have been taken away through mysterious rifts. Read our review. Split Fiction is an excellent, cooperative sci-fi game in which two players must traverse completely different worlds simultaneously, while relying on new powers to help them progress through each stage. Read our review. If you bought a Meta Quest 2, you’re a prime candidate for the Quest 3S. It’s a faster, more comfortable VR headset that runs the same chipset as the pricier Quest 3. While its screen resolution hasn’t improved, nearly everything else about the hardware has. Read our review. What if the dream of Microsoft’s Kinect lived on? It does in the Nex Playground, an all-in-one, motion-controlled console filled with kid-friendly games. Exhaust and entertain your little ones. You’re welcome. This affordable kit includes two glossy screen protectors for the Nintendo Switch 2 that are very easy to install on the system. The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate, as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat. For something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2. It features TMR joysticks with trigger switches for adjusting the feel, as well as vibration and motion control support. Sony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C. The Insta360 Link 2 offers the same auto-swiveling design as its predecessor, but it’s smaller and offers a slate of new features, including group tracking and no-follow zones. The MK.2 version of the standard Stream Deck comes with 15 programmable buttons, a swappable faceplate, and a detachable stand. A teleprompter is a luxury. They help you make it look effortless to look at your camera as you read from a script or a chat log. Elgato’s option includes a small screen and a mirror, the latter of which allows you to see what you need to look at without breaking eye contact with viewers. Samsung’s ultrafast 990 Pro is a PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD that can reach sequential read speeds of 7,450MB/s and write speeds of 6,900MB/s. It’s more than capable for high-end PC builds, and its preinstalled heatsink means it’s easily installable into a PlayStation 5. Its heatsink even has a bit of RGB lighting for some extra pop (if you’re able to see it). The Keychron V1 is one of the best entry-level wired mechanical keyboards available. It has hot-swappable switches, full remappability with VIA, great build quality, RGB backlighting, and double-shot PBT keycaps for under $100. A strategy card game in which players compete to build Renaissance Europe’s most lucrative and prestigious jewelry business.

Title: $30 billion blast-off: Why Rocket Lab just hit an all-time high and the 32,000 Kiwis along for the ride

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck at his firm's mission control room in Auckland. Photo / Dean Purcell Rocket Lab shares jumped 9.03% today to US$38.88, giving the Nasdaq-listed, Kiwi-American firm an all-time high valuation of US$17.94 billion ($30.48b). Forbes accordingly bumped founder Sir Peter Beck’s estimated wealth (based on his 10.5% Rocket Lab stake) by 9% or US$164m to US$2.0b on its real-time net-worth tracker. While most of Beck’s wealth is tied up in his firm, he sold a parcel of shares worth US$20.2m in 2023 to capitalise his charitable foundation. The former Fisher and Paykel Appliances apprentice has also invested in numerous Kiwi start-ups at key points in their life, including Halter, Partly, Foundry Lab, Astrix Astronautics and HeartLab. It’s not just about Beck’s bank account, however. When Rocket Lab began its bull run midway through last year, Sharesies said around 20,000 Kiwis owned shares in the firm through its fractional ownership platform. This morning, co-founder Leighton Roberts said the number has hit 32,000. The average buy price in the volatile stock is US$12.76, Roberts says. Sharesies also recently added Rocket Lab to the list of US stocks eligible for its self-select KiwiSaver scheme, which sees customers choose a base fund, with the option to add various individual stocks or exchange-traded funds. “Several hundred” self-select customers had already added Rocket Lab to their KiwiSaver mix, Roberts told the Herald. Rocket Lab’s share price is now running ahead of analysts’ valuations. According to a Wall Street Journal summary, there are 10 analysts with a “buy” rating on Rocket Lab, with one “overweight” and four giving the stock a “hold”. None of the 15 analysts covering the stock have an “underweight” or “sell” rating. The average 12-month target price is US$32.18 (with a low of US$20.00 and a high of US$45.00). Two interrelated factors are behind the stock’s recent surge. One is SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s fallout with Donald Trump - which has seen the US President withdraw the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to be the new head of Nasa (the US space agency being one of the biggest customers of both SpaceX and Rocket Lab). Trump has also threatened to cancel SpaceX’s Government contracts. At the same time, Rocket Lab is building up to the first test launch of its much larger, crew-capable rocket, the Neutron - which will put it toe to toe with SpaceX for the first time. Rocket Lab has started to sign up the first Neutron customers to its US$1b-plus order book, which was opened after the US election in late 2024. Key clients, including various defence agencies, want competition. Things looked darker as Musk emerged as Trump’s right-hand man, at the same time as SpaceX was pushing for billions more in Federal funding. Now, the stars are more aligned to Beck’s firm. While Neutron will only launch from the US, the giant new rocket forms only half of Rocket Lab’s growth story. The firm is also banking on further growth in its space systems business, including satellite components being manufactured at its expanded Auckland facility. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX - buoyed at the time by Musk’s then-close relationship with Elon Musk - had a US$350b private equity valuation. Beck’s company is the only other private player to stage regular launches, but Musk’s firm is still far ahead. SpaceX, which also owns the Starlink satellite network, staged 138 launches in 2024 to Rocket Lab’s 16. Jeff Bezos’ New Origin - currently best-known for its near-space tourist jaunts - is also gearing up for a medium-lift push. Things have also turned out better than originally anticipated for US solar and wind farm operator Longroad Energy, 37% owned by NZX-listed Infratil. Jarden analysts said the final form of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” was less bad for the clean energy sector than Infratil had anticipated. Arie Dekker and Grant Swanepoel maintained their buy rating and hiked Infratil’s 12-month target price from $10.77 to $14.31 (shares were recently trading at $10.96 (other recent developments have included a 1% fall in CDC’s independent valuation and chief executive Jason Boyes buying $1.25m worth of stock). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provided US$369 billion ($621b) to spur green infrastructure and decarbonisation, was a Biden centrepiece. Trump campaigned on a promise to gut the legislation, which he called “the green scam”, and withhold US$104b in IRA funds yet to be allocated. In its last annual report, written before Trump’s election, Infratil took a punt on political commentary. “More than 80% of the investment in large-scale clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing pledged since the passage of the IRA and the Chips and Science Act will go to Republican congressional districts. Even if Republicans controlled the Federal government, many in the party may view reversing the IRA as too politically risky.” That turned out to be largely prescient. The original “Big Beautiful Bill” gave energy firms 60 days after its passing to begin new projects, thus securing IRA tax credits. Now, after watering down in the Senate, the final “Big Beautiful Bill” gives Longroad and its peers 12 months to start a new project. It’s a complex set-up but Jarden’s read is that Longroad and its peers will be able to “safe harbour” or claim full IRA tax credits until “well beyond 2027″. For Boston-based Longroad - Infratil’s third-largest asset after CDC and One NZ, with a $2.1b fair value - those new projects will include a contract with Meta, signed in December, to supply the Facebook owner with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity to support its data centre operations. It’s a similar story for Allbirds, with its Trump impact bad, but a lot less bad than it initially seemed. In May, Allbirds - the producer of sustainable footwear and activewear made from New Zealand merino wool, co-founded by ex-All White Tim Brown - reported another big loss and another big fall in revenue. But it forecast a return to revenue growth in the final quarter of this year, subject to no more external shocks - and Vietnam, home to nearly all of its manufacturing, succeeding in keeping tariffs on its exports to the US at a 10% “pause” level, rather than the 46% initially slapped on the country on Trump’s “Liberation Day”. A US-Vietnam preliminary trade deal announced overnight set a 20% tariff for Vietnam imports (compared to a pre-Trump average of 10%). Allbirds had braced for the worst, announcing a new US$75m revolving credit facility on June 30. The firm had no immediate statement but its need to draw on the new credit line seems less pressing now than anticipated. Its shares, which dived to US$4.39 after “Liberation Day” have staged a sharp recovery over recent weeks and were recently trading at US$10.54.

Title: Can Nvidia Stock Hit $200 By The End Of 2025?

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Any dip in Nvidia stock is most likely a buying opportunity. This article isn’t about Nvidia’s parabolic rise amid the AI boom. It won’t dwell on the well-known fact that Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 90% of AI data centers worldwide or that tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta remain deeply invested in its silicon innovations. It’s not even about CUDA, Nvidia’s giant competitive moat that is still relevant today. Nor will we focus on how the stock struggled earlier this year, as investors kept raising the bar, until even spectacular results weren’t good enough. And yet, Nvidia has not only reclaimed its top spot, it is trading at record highs. The trillion-dollar question now is: Can Nvidia stock reach $200 by year-end? Or is that a stretch even for a strong compounder like the AI bellwether? On June 25, 2025, Nvidia surged over 4%, closing at a record $154.31, reclaiming its spot as the most valuable publicly traded company (~$3.77 trillion market cap), surpassing Microsoft and Apple. The stock is even higher now, and the last closing price is $159.34, marking a stellar comeback, from Nvidia’s April 4th closing low of $94.30. Nvidia stock erased more than 40% of its value between February and April of this year, not because of any failing on its part. Concerns over moderating AI spending, and unpredictable tariff policies triggered the decline. This is not Nvidia’s first rodeo either. Prior to that, DeepSeek revelations in late January created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day. The market was simply recalibrating its perception of perfection. While DeepSeek showed promise, it is nowhere in the leagues of an established AI leader like Nvidia. So, the sell-off was unjustified in my opinion. The Nvidia stock bounced back within a month. Last year too, Nvidia shares fell nearly 23% from mid-July through early August, closing August 7th trade at $98.88. The sell-off was triggered by fears that Nvidia’s big tech customers may trim their AI spending budgets. However, Nvidia stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at nearly $130. Every time a quality stock drops, the internet floods with "Should you buy the dip?" takes. My view is simple: Study the cause. If the sell-off happened for reasons that can be fixed – go ahead and buy. But if it stems from deeper, structural weaknesses, then walk away. It’s not like there’s only one good stock out there. Nvidia’s deeply integrated AI ecosystem gives it a wide berth over competition, and its innovation remains unsurpassed. Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. That said, investor perception is everything when it comes to stock pricing. The recent rally has given reason to hope that the market may be finally waking up to the true value of this stock following a period of inflated expectations and sharp corrections.The fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to keep the buying pressure active and drive NVDA to at least $180 by the end of this year. Of course, I could be wrong. China is a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened dramatically from 95% before 2022, to 50% currently, after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. To comply with the U.S. export curbs, Nvidia has been selling H20 to China. H20 is a watered-down version of its H100 chips with significantly lower computing power. However, in April, the U.S. government tightened restrictions again, reclassifying even the scaled-down H20 as requiring an export license. The decision effectively halted shipments and dealt Nvidia a serious financial blow. CEO Jensen Huang put it bluntly: “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.” Calling the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market “effectively closed to the U.S. industry,” Huang also warned that if U.S. export restrictions continue, more Chinese customers will turn to Huawei's chips. I highlighted this risk in a previous article that flagged both the threat of an H20 ban and Huawei’s preparation for competitive positioning, citing Jefferies and WSJ reports. Nvidia recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue prior to April 9, before the new export restrictions kicked in. The financial fallout from the ban was significant. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in unsold H20 inventory for the first quarter, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of what would have been H20-generated revenue. Gross margin fell to 61%, versus the 71.3% it would have reported without the China-related charges. In an interview with the Stratechery podcast in May, Huang also revealed the company had to walk away from an additional $15 billion of sales. The topline guidance of $45 billion for the July quarter, would have been higher by $8 billion, but for the new export restrictions. So, why is there still hope for a China rebound for Nvidia? Nvidia is pivoting swiftly. A Reuters report citing sources familiar to the matter said Nvidia is planning to build a GPU or graphics processing unit for China based on its latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors that will be priced at $6,500-8,000, well below the H20’s price range of $10,000-$12,000. The lower price could reflect the new export limits on GPU memory bandwidth – a metric crucial for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Also, recent developments suggest a thaw in the U.S.’s formerly hardline stance against China, signaling a broader shift in tone This gives rise to a key question: In this more conciliatory phase, is there any possibility that the U.S. could revisit its chip export restrictions to China as well? The New York Times reported on June 27th that China confirmed details of a trade framework with the Trump administration. “China will review and approve applications for the export of controlled items,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, and “the United States will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures it has taken against China.” While specifics remain vague, the framework hints at a meaningful de-escalation. The most compelling driver behind this shift? Not a change of heart, just China’s dominance in rare earth elements – critical for semiconductors, robotics and aerospace applications. This accord between the U.S. and China, includes the latter’s commitment to deliver rare earth, in exchange for the U.S. lifting its export curbs on ethane, chip software and jet engines. As trade talks evolve, Beijing is not above deploying its rare earth “Trump card” to reopen access to restricted U.S. AI chip technologies. If the U.S. should revise or relax chip export policies or greenlight a new line of compliant processors, Nvidia could regain access to the highly lucrative market. Such a development would materially bolster the case for Nvidia hitting $200 by year’s end. However, even without China, Nvidia remains on solid footing, thanks to its ability to innovate relentlessly. Nvidia’s growth story is deeply structural, spanning beyond GPUs to hyperscaler ramp-ups, AI factories, sovereign AI, Networking, gaming, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. Nvidia isn’t just firing on all cylinders – it is building entirely new growth engines. Blackwell’s Blockbuster Ramp: In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia’s data center revenue surged 73% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $39 billion, with compute revenue accounting for $34.2 billion, up 76% y-o-y. At the heart of this explosive growth lies Blackwell, the fastest-ramping architecture in Nvidia’s history. AI Factories and Sovereign AI: As nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack, Sovereign AI is a solid growth engine for the AI bellwether. Nvidia has sovereign AI deals in place with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. AI factory build-outs are driving significant revenue for Nvidia with deployments at AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek and Telenor. The count of Nvidia-powered AI factories doubled y-o-y to roughly 100 in the first quarter, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. Nvidia’s new Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics switches will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs. These switches offer 3.5x greater power efficiency, 10x higher network resiliency and accelerate customer time-to-market by 1.3x. Other revenue drivers: This brings us to networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia with first-quarter networking revenue reaching nearly $5 billion, up 56% y-o-y and 64% sequentially. Networking growth was driven by NVLink, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. Also helping networking growth is the continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions. Spectrum X – which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI – is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue with deployments across Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Meta, Google Cloud and xAI. For AI-powered cybersecurity – Checkpoint, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA’s AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows. CrowdStrike, for instance, has achieved 2x faster detection triage with 50% fewer compute resources. Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record $3.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of the Blackwell architecture. Professional Visualization revenue, which includes Nvidia Omniverse, rose 19% from a year ago to $509 million, thanks to broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation. Automotive and Robotics revenue rose 72% to $567 million from a year ago, driven by sales of Nvidia’s self-driving platforms. Most recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company’s next biggest growth opportunity after AI, noting that self-driving cars are likely to be the first major commercial application of this technology. Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as expensive as it is touted to be. Some valuation metrics suggest room for upside: Interestingly, those discount levels align closely with the roughly 25-30% upside Nvidia would need to reach $200. That leaves the question less about if Nvidia can reach $200 and more about when investors will be ready to price that in. So, what are analysts saying about the Nvidia stock? Nvidia currently has a “Strong Buy” rating with a 12-month price target of $174 per share. Loop Capital lifted its price target for Nvidia to $250 from $175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. The rating firm’s client note said, "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.” Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating with a $200 target, citing robust fundamentals and strong growth expectations through 2025 and especially in 2026. A few Bumps on Nvidia's road to $200 include: Bottom line In my opinion, Nvidia stock is likely to reach at least $180 by year-end, supported by a re-rating in its forward PEG to around 1.47, if market sentiment continues to remain constructive. Key catalysts will be earnings announcements for the rest of the year, but it all boils down to market perception. Nvidia can continue to generate stellar results, and if that fails to align with already-high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could pause or pull back. That said, for the long-term, Nvidia is a structural compounder with deeply embedded growth levers and robust AI tailwinds. Any dip in the stock is most likely a buying opportunity. If there is any change in China export policy, the Nvidia stock could achieve its $180 target even sooner and be well on its way to $200 by year-end.

Mr. Zuckerberg later learned that his A.I. team had wanted the models to appear to perform well, even though they were not doing as well as hoped, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Zuckerberg was not briefed on the customized tests and was upset, two people said. His solution was to throw more bodies at the problem. Meta’s A.I. division swelled to more than 1,000 people this year, up from a few hundred two years earlier. The rapid growth led to infighting and management squabbles. And with Mr. Zuckerberg’s round-the-clock, hard-charging management style — his attention on a project is often compared to the “Eye of Sauron” internally, a reference to the “Lord of the Rings” villain — some engineers burned out and left. Executives hunkered down to brainstorm next steps, including potentially ratcheting back investment in Llama. In fairness to Meta, the NYT failed to mention that Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that it’s “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” And if you can’t trust the fine folks at Meta, who can you trust? But I don’t want to dismiss Zuckerberg too cavalierly. I’m a serial sucker taking things at face value, investing based on business fundamentals and underlying product value, and betting on professional wrestling. He’s a stone playa who read the true nature of this society at a very early age, from The Harvard Crimson, 2003: The creator of the short-lived but popular Harvard version of the Am I Hot or Not? website said he will not have to leave school after being called before the Administrative Board yesterday afternoon. Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 said he was accused of breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com, about two weeks ago. The charges were based on a complaint from the computer services department over his unauthorized use of on-line facebook photographs, he said. Zuckerberg said he will not be forced to withdraw or leave school for any amount of time, but declined to elaborate on whether the board took some lesser action. …“I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson earlier this month. After taking it down, Zuckerberg decided that criticism of the site was too strong to re-post it. “Issues about violating people’s privacy don’t seem to be surmountable,” he wrote at that point. “I’m not willing to risk insulting anyone.” The site was created entirely by Zuckerberg over the last week in October, after a friend gave him the idea. The website used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person. Students were ranked within the general Harvard community and individual Houses according to attractiveness. Zuckerberg hacked into House websites to gather the photos, and then wrote the codes to compute rankings after every vote. The programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg’s primary interest in creating it, he said. After creating the website, Zuckerberg forwarded the link to a few friends for advice. But the link then was sent out on several campus group list-serves, and traffic skyrocketed. In the course of one day, the number of visitors quadrupled—by 10 p.m., the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times. The part I love about the story above is the way Zuckerberg is the only source quoted. Those Harvard educated journalists are allowed to be awful from the get. She also didn’t report the blog post he put up the night he launched the site: “I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. By the time of his 2018 congressional testimony Zuck had gotten some press training: Zuckerberg, 33, paused and smirked. “No, congressman. FaceMash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,” he said. “You put up two pictures of two women and decided which one was the better, more attractive of the two, is that right?” Long asked. Zuckerberg responded, with an emphasis on his youth at the time: “That is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was a sophomore in college.” Ok, so he’s always been ruthless, shrewd and openly anti-social but I’m not sure he’s really that smart. Social media had been pioneered by MySpace, Friendster and several other companies long before Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea for Facebook from classmates. Facebook primarily rose to the top because of three factors: Since launching Facebook, his biggest wins have come from buying budding competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp more than from any internally created ideas. Never forget, this is the same guy who spent $47 billion in five years on “the Metaverse.” He clearly cannot tell a good idea from a bad one. He’s explained his recent AI spending spree to investors (who have no ability to depose him) in April: “The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do.” At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs. What Zuckerberg didn’t say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. “Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he’s not going to be stopped,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC’s “Money Movers.” Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they’re building.” I had to include the hypersonic quote from D.A. that CNBC featured. I’m sure it made great TV. It wouldn’t be American corporate media if it didn’t feature interchangeable hustlers competing to spout the most ridiculous nonsense in the most simplistic terms. They’re all like a TV sportscaster talking to drunks at noon on a Sunday except with no contract and an urgent need to be invited back right away. Also making me doubt Zuckerberg’s wisdom was his recent, much publicized decision to hire the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s CEO Dana White to be a board member for a reported seven figure stock and cash compensation package. Although there was some logic behind that decision. From The MMA Draw, a publication aimed at investors in the fight sports industry: This well-planned and well-executed attention-getter kicked off Meta’s 2025 with a bang. That’s right, Meta, a company with a $1.59 TRILLION market cap has brought America’s best-known fight promoter (and wife-beater) on their board of directors. The collective “WTF?!?” spawned headlines and social media posts all over the Internet. Based on this round-up of headlines from Google News, the mainstream media already has a theory and it has to do with a certain newly re-elected President celebrating a big anniversary on January 6th. pic.twitter.com/zQb8SgdvWq — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 It’s also, according to The MMA Draw, part of Zuckerberg personally rebranding himself for the Trump era: Reason #2: Zuck Is Getting Based 2024 saw Mark Zuckerberg embark on what Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called “a wider strategic overhaul of the tech mogul’s public image.” She also explained why Zuckerberg might be doing this: Meta is embroiled in an anti-monopoly lawsuit and is being sued by dozens of states alleging that Facebook and Instagram are exploiting children to boost profits. Far better, don’t you think, that we all talk about how handsome a bearded Zuck would be rather than dwell on Meta’s less attractive business practices? Honestly, it’s been a pretty incredible rebranding campaign for Zuckerberg, scoring wins by showing off his wakeboarding, flag-waving, and beer-drinking mastery. Anyone who remembers Zuckerberg’s pathetic attempt to launch himself as a potential political candidate in 2017 should be impressed by how dramatically he’s improved his PR game. He’s even gotten favorable notice from the Twitter fashion guy. Zuck’s (seemingly genuine) fondness for training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a big part of this rebranding and a great excuse to pal around with Dana White. Zuckerberg been talking up his love for BJJ since at least this 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Mark Zuckerberg on what he loves about BJJ: (It’s) a thing that is both super engaging physically but also intellectually and where you can’t afford to focus on something else. I think (it’s) the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second you’re gonna end up on the bottom. So I’ve just found that is just really important for me in terms of what I do. Being able to maintain my energy level, maintain my focus… then after an hour or two of working out or rolling or wrestling with friends, now I’m ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. Zuckerberg has also medaled in a BJJ tournament and at one point even had Dana White calling up the Roman Colosseum looking for the right venue to host a bout between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Naturally with 2020’s Zuckerberg, even the cage fight was vaporware. Caveat: The Market, aka the most effective price discovery system ever invented disagrees. pic.twitter.com/eGqayBw4If — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. The dual share structure grants him dictatorial powers at Meta, meaning the guy has Imprimatur to do pretty much what he wants, including torching $47bn on what amounted to little more than a personal obsession with the metaverse, memory-holing that episode, and then lining up hundreds of billions more in his continuing quest for a defining “second act” that will secure his place amongst the pantheon of great innovators (as opposed to being known as the guy who stole the idea for facebook from a friend and has since built his empire on strangling emerging competitors in the crib). He’s as desperate for this second act as Trump is for a Nobel Peace Price. His strategy clearly rests on aggregating the critical inputs for AI supremacy ie data (expect Meta’s family of apps to be harvested for every last bit of training data, user privacy be damned), algorithms (Deepseek’s algorithmic breakthroughs shocked SV titans, including MZ, to their core, hence his poaching spree to build bench strength and an AI intellectual aristocracy within Meta to push forward the frontier of algorithmic discovery, which by the way, given Meta’s history, will likely mean just copying whatever the real frontier players are doing) and compute (data centre build out is the sport of kings and given his profligate pursuit of metaverse supremacy, the man can outspend an army of drunken sailors everyday and twice on Sunday). We sure do live in interesting times. https://youtu.be/_v3KiaAjpY8?feature=shared I would recommend this video in full as it does flesh out the whole notion of how one reinvents themselves (or as this video calls it – becoming a new guy) as part of the broadrler topic. It does address Zuck in particular around 42:37. Zuckerberg and the other techbros are looking several steps ahead, but they’re not great at watching their feet. Hey we saw the movie version, Aaron Sorkin on top of every PMC trend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_network It’s not exactly warm and friendly toward Zuck but does seem enamored of Larry Summers. As for Zuckerberg’s trial and error business model that’s so very much a Silicon Valley thing is it not? Musk blows up a giant rocket and just shrugs. break things Contrast with Zuck against say, Bill Gates who quite famously took others ideas or seriously underpaid in hindsight, either is applicable. Good connections and voila, now IBM has a supplier in Microsoft for their software OS on this new idea called the PC…Mark just took the same steps but got to the wealthy billionaire level much quicker. So much to add about my personal experience but I enjoy many of the films directed or helmed by Fincher. Even the occasional dud or a film he disavowed, Alien 3 being a key example. Speaking of the Facebook/Zuck movie, it was recently rated as the 10th best movie of the 21st century by both fans and critics. I mean, I liked the movie OK, but 10th best of the (quarter) century? Not even close, and I don’t watch that many movies. https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/best-movies-21st-century-new-york-times-films-111414429.html I was listening to a podcast about AI and investing. Regardless of what you think about it, it is getting lots of attention from investors that don’t want to be left out. Meaning if you are not investing in it you look like a fool and they will take their money elsewhere. Never mind what China keeps doing with low cost AI. Whether he’s interested or not, he kinda has to go along with the narrative > Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad #NitPick: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Unearned, Magic Money Made Up Via Market Malfeasance After Bad It’s all Unicorn Rainbow Poop, designed via finacial chicanery to become high powered money. All of it, inflated value made real via stock “money”. That’s why he can pelt it around like tennis balls at a summer carnival trying to win prizes. Ugh. It’s family-blogging tragic when you think about it from the perspective of the public good being laid waste to by the US uni-party. And another “inception” subtext to all this is our collective sanitization of the term “billionaire”, and the notion of “a billion dollars”. And absolutely obscene amount of money that could fuel a thousand lifetimes, sadly made acceptable for one person to have in a single lifetime. #GuillotineWatch lost the last of 3 baby geese. and i stepped on a wire or something in the flooded road(tetanus vaxxed)…so my feets are both wrinkled and one is sorta sore. no other casualties. i am alone with the animals on this place. we’re all good. 23″. since thursday afternoon. 7-7-2025 so heres how it happened for me. july 3rd, afternoon, check weather, as usual. Looks like heavy rain and some flooding…so I decide, after evening chores…critters put up, etc…to sit out at the wilderness bar, drinking beer(started w a margarita(likker first!)) and rolled 4 little joints(lack of proper zigzags), and determined to watch the storm…as is my wont…..my fone is filled with vids of these often dramatic events…usually brief. This event didnt turn out to be brief,lol. When im out here, I have my laptop for music and for occupying myself with the web. And also for weather. First place I go when I get up(4am) is NWS and Wundermap, to see whats happening…and then I do this regularly, all day. So I had all my weather shit in one window…so i’m watching the storms IRL, and on the near real time radar. And a brief, relatively minor event, turned into a catastrophe….storms just sat there, dumping rain by the tankerfull…all over from here to kerrville. (turns out I got the most rain from this event…24” on my place, since thursday afternoon…more than kerr cnty..but I dont live on a river, nor have canyons). So I watched it rain…hard. Threw a tarp over the laptop and retreated(quite drunk and high, mind you) to the spots that generally stay dry. And it just kept on raining, superhard. Im from houston, and ive spent a lot of time in a vw van all over the gulf coast, and ive never seen a monsoon, before, save in films. Thats what this was like…bangladesh. So im out here, 5 sheets to the wind(by now, im sipping tequila…because why the hell not?) watching this incredible monsoon hammer down and I remember thinking, “ well, this aint what they predicted”. So I watched and watched…and soon, I heard a sound that I know well…rushing water…like over a rapids at a river. But way out here. It was the road and my almost always dry gully…which is not connected(for 40 years) to any current drainage system in this watershed. I had a pond…but filled with rushing water, calf-high…and so did the road,,,,and it stayed that way for…well…well into the next day(saturday), and I couldnt get to the highway until sunday. Im 20+ miles from the Llano river, maybe 12 from the San Saba. We do flood, due to the hills…but rarely anything like this. But we dont have canyons…and we have more silt…often deep, between the hills, instead of the limestone caliche that they have down there(about 50 miles as crow flies from me, to my southwest) Its now monday evening, july 7th…and it only stopped raining about 4 hours ago. Ive had some breaks…such to pick squash and zukes and a whole lotta green beans to can…and ive been to the highway, to look at the dirt road…torn up, but passable once the water ran off. That was saturday midday, I think,lol. Maybe sunday///it all runs together. \ive had intervals where I could go out and do farmer things…but then it rains again. I was out in the worst of it…thursday night, all day friday….half of that time drunk as a skunk,,,with a headlight, crocs and naked(why get yer clothes wet?) and checking on the critters….and just surveying what was going on. I am currently alone on this place…mom’s been at galveston for a week now, with my brother and his brood. This is NOT how I wanted to spend my vacation from her,lol. I’ve got a leaky house…due to being bad at roofing,lol…so my house is wet and moldy. Take a week of fans and dry weather to even begin. But I aint in kerrville, or comfort, or any of a thousand little wide spots in the road(and real cities, too) who have had it much, much worse than I. I feel for those folks…and recognise immediately many of the places in all the vids out there. I have lived out here in the texas hill country for 30 and a half years, now. I know this place, this area, this region. In that time, ive seen catastrophic floods…more often than not, along the guadalupe. But ive never seen anything as catastrophic as this. Pray, or send $, or sacrifice a chicken or whatever. A hurricane came to the middle of texas. So glad to hear from you and that beyond some very annoying property damage, you came through OK! We missed your comments. It reminded me of childhood when a tooth came out and before the adult tooth erupted you keep noticing the gap. The mouth is functional but incomplete….. that’s probably a stupid analogy but just woke up. Here in middle England we are supposedly about to enter phase 2 of our summer record breaking heatwave. This time round my dad has been a total star and I have portable A/C unit now fully set up with appropriate window covering for exhaust fan set up. Hardly very environmentally friendly but after attending a meetup group of locals and seeing where the mood of this country is taking us, I don’t feel very inclined to do my bit anymore for the next generation. UK entering FAFO phase. glad you are for the most part ok Was hoping you and your’n were ok… and glad to hear it’s so… Glad you survived, what a storm! What a tale to tell… Glad everything is jake~ Glad to hear that you made it though the storm OK. Lots of people were asking after you the past coupla days and were worried about you. Guess that you have a boat load of repairs and work to do now that the storm has abated. You wonder if this will be the last such storm that you will see or if there will be more such storms down the track. #Amen Does the silt retain water that soaks through it? Could this event lead to local groundwater recharge? If so, that could be a future benefit from all this rain right where you are at. It could hold you over somewhat through the long drought to come sooner or later. Has any thought been given ( should any thought be given) to deepening the pond so it can store more water between the occasional super-rains? yes. the deep silt(sandy loam, its called) directly recharges the hickory sand aquifer beneath me. this is why i modified the levies and such in both pastures to divert floods into them, where it can soak in(also feed the deep subsoil, that sits just above a layer of black/gray clay, around 6 foot down.(i dug cores by hand long ago…yes i am a glutton for punishment, as well as a nut for such info) the native prairie grasses(and things like wilman love i planted long ago to stabilise the then sand) have deep, deep roots that…along with the tree roots…poke through that clay strata and allow water to percolate down. down around Kerrville, Fredricksburg, Comfort, etc(all along the Balcones Fault), they have caliche…a limestone and clay sort of dirt…that becomes concrete when theres a drought….that was the situation on july 3rd. that sort of formation is called Karst…and recharge occurs through caves and fractures created over long term by the rain being just acidic enough to eat through the limestone bedrock. so totally different than here. my area is older,as far as the long ago Llano Uplift is concerned….the Karst we have remaining is up on the hill tops, and has to a great extent worn away, leaving the old granite plutons…like Katemcy Rocks, or Enchanted Rock. Theres one of those under every limestone hill you find in the entire Llano Uplift. and the limestone on our hills is old and brittle…unsuited for building, etc. here, between the hills, are deep valleys, filled with silt/sandy loam…on my place, the granite bedrock is around 100-120′ deep. thats where our wells tap in. my neighbor, not 400 yards thataway, has granite not 20′ deep, and has to do rainwater. i ended up with just over 23″, as of this time yesterday. and a large part of that water that flowed on my place, stayed here(pastures are still covered in 4″ of water), and went down. this is why swales and contour plowing are such a big deal, allows the rain to hang around and soak in, leaving yer topsoil in place, rather than carrying it off to the Gulf. biggest impact for me is my house…due to my poor roofing skills,lol. ive been running fans and hauling out the remains of the mess the boys left me when they ran off into their lives, fixin to remove furniture(free and old), etc…and just GI the whole house, so i can spread pinesol on the whole floors, and finally paint them, sometime in august. mold is what im racing against. 1200 sq ft house, so a big job…and i already had too much work and not enough body. thank y’all for askin after me. So glad you’re OK Amfortas… and also glad you’re so handy and will be able to recover. Take good care. Glad you’re OK. Stay safe!

It’s likely to be the latter more often. But the opposite is true, as well: We also believe that the best place to hire from is the competition. Just recently, Meta’s new division — with an eye on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) — announced 11 key hires from arch rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. If reports are to be believed, Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading the hiring campaign by hosting some of the potential hires at his home. This prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to claim that Meta offered $100 million signing bonuses to some of his employees. And Meta isn’t alone. The move echoes industry-wide trends. This year alone, Microsoft spent $650 million acquiring much of Inflection AI’s team while Amazon hired the co-founders of Adept, a start-up developing AI-powered agents. Begs the question whether anti-compete contracts aren’t at play? In a recent case of a software engineer vs his former employer, the Delhi High Court ruled that the non-compete clauses blocking job switches are not enforceable. The court said that Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, clearly says that any agreement that restrains anyone from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business shall be void. A research handbook published by the leading global law firm DLA Piper offers insights into anti-compete laws worldwide. Interestingly, among the 34 major countries they studied, only in five, including India, are the non-compete employment contracts non-enforceable. But, just in case you have forgotten the fine print of your employment contract and want to browse it again, you will find an anti-compete clause glaring at you. Did the MNCs bring their global template to India and were we only too happy to copy and paste it from entry-level jobs to senior leaders, making no distinction between the dictates of the roles and the laws of the land? Cognizant’s hiring of Wipro’s former CFO sparked a legal battle, which eventually got settled after nine months. The current legal proceedings between Cognizant and Infosys, involving allegations of anti-competitive practices in the US healthcare IT market, show that the stakes are high for these enterprises. When firms lose leaders who hold key customer relationships or techies who have the IP to build new-age products or platforms at the competition, the threat is real. This may prompt organisations to protect their interests, which explains the suits. In spite of these potential legal exposures, why do boards still hire CEOs from the competition? The mindset of large enterprises with deep pockets is to ‘buy’ talent, rather than ‘build’ it, since this takes time, and the risks of a potential anti-compete suit are outweighed by the benefits of the hiring. The popular ask from hiring managers is “We want to recruit someone who hits the road running”. When Zomato wanted to boost its live events business, it didn’t promote someone internally— it hired the live events head from BookMyShow and designated him as Founder. Ditto Starbucks — within 17 months of hiring a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, it replaced him with a leader from Chipotle, and immediately its stock price went up by 20 per cent and has remained steady since. Even the stock market cheers when you hire from the competition. The hypocritical mindset of enterprise culture is hard to miss. We hire our top talent from rivals but internally we berate them on a regular basis to build the competitive spirit in our teams. Whenever we chest-thump about our products, services or employers, we can’t help but reference them against our competitors, and hence it’s emotionally hard to accept anyone amongst us joining a rival. Hence, we resort to practices like ‘garden leave’, immediate relieving, legal threats, and/or holding on to financial dues as a mark of retaliation. All these also send a ‘message’ to colleagues of the consequences of joining the competition. These over-the-top reactions breed a different set of behaviours among team members, who eventually start lying about their health and personal matters when they leave or join friendly employers briefly and eventually join competitors a couple of months later. I agree it’s an uphill task to eliminate the anti-compete clauses we have included in all roles within our enterprises. But can we take a leaf out of Belgium, where non-competition clauses are valid only if the employee earns an annual gross remuneration of at least €78,706? Day in and day out, our leaders talk about the strength of our brands, the legacy of the company, loyal customers, enviable culture, best financial rewards and, not to forget, the Best Employer certificates that we keep flashing. However, our employment contracts don’t reflect the same spirit that we find on our office posters. Are enterprises built with such weak foundations that one leadership movement to the competition can bring them down? What’s the fear? When sports clubs and premier leagues allow players to be bought and compete against the club where they were trained at, why not enterprises?

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: India-US Trade Deal, Q1 Results, FOMC Minutes: The Week Ahead
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/india-us-trade-deal-q1-results-fomc-minutes-the-week-ahead
Time Published: 2025-07-06T08:47:17Z
Full Content:
Global developments will shape market sentiment in the coming week along with quarterly earnings. Among important events is the announcement of US-India trade deal. Along with US President Donald Trump’s move to inform trading partners about planned tariff rate. The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. The June 2025 quarter earnings season begins this week, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. set to announce its results. On the IPO front, Travel Food Services’ public issue opens for subscription, and Crizac is set to debut on the stock exchanges. Back home, Indian equities ended last week in the red amid caution around the India-US trade deal, foreign capital outflows, and the start of the earnings season. The Nifty formed a small bearish candle on the weekly chart, suggesting a phase of consolidation after recent gains. Analysts expect the index to trade with a positive bias within the 25,200–25,700 range, with stock-specific action likely to drive market direction. Benchmark indices broke a two-day losing streak to settle higher on Friday but on a weekly basis the Nifty 50 and Sensex declined over 0.75%. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 55.70 points or 0.22% higher at 25,461, while the BSE Sensex closed 193.42 points or 0.23% up at 83,432.89. This week, the broader market indices outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing declines after two consecutive weeks of gains. The Nifty Realty sector saw a significant drop of over 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the week, with Macrotech Developers Ltd. and Brigade Developers leading the declines. Investor focus in the coming week will remain firmly on the uncertain India-US trade deal, with US President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline approaching. Despite months of negotiations, no breakthrough has been achieved, and it is expected that the deal will be announced in the coming week. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that India will not rush into any deal based on external deadlines, insisting that any agreement must be fully concluded and in the national interest. Markets are also preparing for the start of the fr=irst quarter earnings season. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Tata Elxsi Ltd. will report their results during the week, offering early insights into sector performance amid ongoing global demand concerns. Retail giant DMart is scheduled to announce its results on Friday. Apart from corporate earnings, India’s weekly foreign exchange reserves, will be released on Friday. While investors wait for US President Donald Trump’s move ahead of the deadline of July 9, they will also track US Federal Reserve's minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. US crude oil inventories will also be released on Wednesday. Additionally, the US will release the jobless claims data for the week ending July 5. UK will release its GDP date for the May. The primary market is set for a busy week with six new public issues lined up, including one major mainboard IPO and five SME offerings. The headline act is Travel Food Services, a Mumbai-based operator of airport lounges and quick-service restaurants across India and Malaysia. Its Rs 2,000 crore public issue opens on July 7, with a price band of Rs 1,045–1,100 per share. The offer comprises 1.82 crore existing shares, and investors must apply for a minimum of 13 shares. On the SME front, upcoming IPOs include GLEN Industries, Chemkart India, Smarten Power Systems, CFF Fluid Control, and Asston Pharmaceuticals. These smaller offerings aim to tap into investor appetite for niche, high-growth companies in specialised sectors. The listings provide a range of options for investors seeking opportunities outside of large-cap names. Several IPOs are also set to make their stock market debut this week. Pushpa Jewellers, Silky Overseas, Vandan Foods, Cedaar Textile, and Marc Loire will list on July 7. Crizac in the only main board listing in the week and will debut on July 9, followed by Cryogenic OGS and White Force on July 10, and Meta Infotech on July 11. The upcoming week is set to be active with various corporate actions, including several companies going ex-trade for dividends, bonus issues and rights issues. Investors looking to benefit from these actions should pay close attention to the ex-dates to ensure their eligibility. Key names in focus this week include HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., among others, all of which have record dates for final and special dividends coming up. Titan Co., JSW Steel Ltd., Mphasis Ltd., Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Apollo Tyres Ltd. and IDFC First Bank Ltd. are among the many stocks that will trade ex-dividend this week. Meghna Infracon Infrastructure Ltd., Alkosign Ltd., Dynamic Cables Ltd. and Roto Pumps Ltd. are scheduled to distribute bonus shares to their stakeholders, ahead of their respective record dates next week.

Title: The Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public

Time Published: 2025-07-06T06:19:41Z

A few months ago, I needed to send an email. But when I opened Microsoft Outlook, something had changed. Microsoft asked me to use Copilot to write my email. Copilot is my AI companion. (That’s the cute word they use.) Hey I don’t want a companion—especially not a fake AI buddy. I never asked for this. And what about the people receiving my emails? They don’t want this either. They want to hear from me, not a bot. How do I turn my companion off? After some trial-and-error, I found a way to disable Copilot. Phew! But a few days later, Microsoft surprised me again. It wouldn’t let me save an Excel file until I had agreed to new terms for my software account. Guess what? AI is now bundled into all of my Microsoft software. Even worse, Microsoft recently raised the price of its subscriptions by $3 per month to cover the additional AI benefits. I get to use my AI companion 60 times per month as part of the deal. But I don’t want to use it. I want to kill it. As you can see, I’ve never used this service. I still have all 60 credits unused. But I’m paying for it—because it’s now embedded into Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason. Most people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product. You never get to decide. Before proceeding let me ask a simple question: Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8% of the public would pay for it? That’s never happened before in human history. Everybody wanted electricity in their homes. Everybody wanted a radio. Everybody wanted a phone. Everybody wanted a refrigerator. Everybody wanted a TV set. Everybody wanted the Internet. They wanted it. They paid for it. They enjoyed it. AI isn’t like that. People distrust it or even hate it—and more so with each passing month. So the purveyors must bundle it into current offerings, and force usage that way. There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and services, they can hide the losses on their income statement. That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more likely, loss) very easy to measure. Shareholders would complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address customer concerns. But if AI is bundled into existing businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker, even if the public is lukewarm or hostile. It’s like a restaurant selling granite rocks for dessert. Nobody will buy them or eat them—so the product fails miserably. But if a popular restaurant adds a dollar to the meal price, and gives every customer a rock with their bill—well, then they can say that: Every customer gets rocks for dessert. Every customer pays for it. Their business is more profitable because of the tasty granite rocks. This is how AI accounting works in Silicon Valley. And that’s why Google does something similar to Microsoft. They add AI to search results—you don’t get to choose. It’s force-feeding all over again. So these huge digital platforms can pretend that users have totally embraced the new tech. Shut up, buddy, and chew on your rock. This is how AI gets implemented everywhere. You don’t get to choose. You’re never asked. It just shows up. Now you have to deal with it. I don’t want AI customer service—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI responses to my Google searches—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI integrated into my software—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI sending me emails—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI music on Spotify—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI books on Amazon—but I don’t get a choice. If they gave people a choice, they would reject this tyranny masquerading as innovation. The AI business model would collapse overnight if they needed consumer opt-in. Just pass that law, and see how quickly the bots disappear. Customer surveys prove that. The survey cited above presented customers with descriptions of different refrigerators. When AI was added as a feature, people showed a preference for all the other models. The Wall Street Journal concludes that companies should “beware of promoting AI in products.” And it’s more than just products and services. People don’t even want AI in texts or documents of any sort. In an earlier day, customer feedback would discourage businesses from adding AI. But the dominant AI companies are huge quasi-monopolies. So they don’t ask, they don’t care—they just do it. Every day it gets more brazen. Meta is now planning to unleash bots on you in even more aggressive ways than Google or Microsoft. They are training AI bots to send you messages, whether you want them or not. And I know (from painful personal experience) that you cannot disable Facebook Messenger without shutting down your entire Facebook account. There’s a word for this. It’s called spam—and people hate it. But that’s the blight of the AI revolution. It looks like spam. It smells like spam. It tastes like spam. What happens if we decide to boycott AI? The sad truth is that we can’t. It’s already too powerful. If I wanted to boycott AI, I would need to give up My email account All Google searches My word processing software Also Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Amazon and many other online retailers Spotify and any other music streamer that allows it Contacting customer service at many companies Etc. etc. etc. That’s bad news—because most of us need some of those things to live and work. But it will soon get much worse. Just wait and see. The day will eventually come when… You want to see a doctor or nurse—but you will be forced to use the AI chatbot. You will desperately need counseling, but only AI will be available. You seek legal advice, and just get a bot. You apply for a job, but they give it to a bot instead. You need an emergency responder—police, firefighter, paramedic—but you can only reach a bot. We already know that they won’t let us choose. That’s already decided. So now the only question is how quickly they will remove the few remaining instances where humans deal with humans. Judging by the current situation, tech companies will move quickly. They don’t ask for permission. It just happens. What’s most shocking is that they have done all this before making AI reliable. Every day I hear accounts of stupid and ridiculous things coming from bots. You would think they would fix this mess before forcing AI on us. But here’s the harsh reality. They won’t fix it, because they don’t know how. Despite that, they will accelerate the force-feeding. There should be laws against this. There should be transparency laws. There should be opt-in laws. There should be liability laws. There should be IP laws. We’re lucky that AI bots don’t write the laws—at least not yet. We should take action before that happens. And if politicians won’t act, let’s turn to voter initiatives (which are binding in many places) or class-action suits or take other steps. I have a hunch that juries will be sympathetic to our plight. After all, they are getting force-fed too. Let me address a final question—which is the frequently mentioned argument that the US needs to develop AI as fast as possible to get there before the Chinese. I’m not sure where there is. But I’m happy to let China or other countries arrive at that unhappy destination while I wait behind and watch. I’m absolutely certain that getting there will be a matter of great regret. There might even be the last place you would want to be. So I’d rather it happened as far away from here as possible. Ted, you called it "spam." My term for it is far less polite. I'm off all social media. I refuse to use AI for my writing. When AI "overviews" come up on Google searches, I immediately skip past them to real sources. I opt out as much as one individual can. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office and they don't have AI. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Nvidia Briefly on Track to Become World's Most Valuable Company Ever
URL: https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/nvidia-on-track-worlds-most-valuable-company-ever-8825548
Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:39:29Z
Full Content:
Photo Credit: Reuters Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4 percent to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalization than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5 percent at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7 percent to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8 percent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 percent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7 percent of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28 percent of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

The holiday season is make-or-break for many retailers, with Christmas marketing turning up the heat on sales and customer engagement. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported U.S. holiday (November-December) retail sales reached a record $994.1 billion in 2024, up 4% from 2023. That’s nearly $1 trillion of buying power in just two months. And about 55% of e‑commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is generated in the last two quarters of the year. With consumers ready to spend, it’s essential to have a solid plan in place. Here are 22 proven Christmas marketing ideas, complete with real examples and practical tips to help inspire impactful festive campaigns. Holiday shoppers behave differently from other times of year. Many start early: roughly 28% of consumers begin holiday shopping before Labor Day, and nearly 73% aim to have most gifts purchased by December. In other words, planning for Christmas Marketing should begin well in advance (late summer or early fall) to catch early-bird buyers. Mobile and social channels dominate this season: mobile devices generate 71% of digital traffic and 56% of orders during the holidays, while 89% of consumers say social media influences their holiday shopping. Moreover, festive campaigns also play by different rules than everyday promotions. Shoppers expect holiday-themed storytelling, festive visuals, and limited-time urgency. Campaigns that feel warm, joyful, and generous can cut through the clutter. As Subharun Mukherjee, Head of Marketing at CleverTap, notes in the Guide to Optimizing Massive Online Sales (OMOS) Events e-book: “Global online events are revolutionizing the e‑commerce landscape, with companies reporting their highest sales during the holiday season. During online sales events, customers are inundated with deals, discounts, and exclusive offers, making it even harder for businesses to differentiate themselves from the competition.” Merchants must align their Christmas marketing ideas with today’s realities: digital-first, mobile-optimized, and emotionally resonant campaigns that stand out in a crowded and competitive environment. Christmas marketing requires early, creative planning and strategies tuned to seasonal mindsets. With that in mind, here are 22 top Christmas marketing ideas to boost sales this holiday season: Run a “25 Days of Christmas” sale or advent-style countdown on your site. Feature a different deal or product each day and promote it via email marketing, SMS, and push notification. Daily surprises (e.g., flash discounts or bonus gifts) build excitement and urgency as Christmas approaches. You can use CleverTap for Christmas marketing to schedule automated push or in-app messages for each day’s offer, keeping users engaged with timed alerts. This approach gamifies shopping and drives repeat visits to see what’s next. Create themed gift bundles (e.g., “Holiday Wellness Kit” or “Winter Warmth Bundle”) that group complementary products with a special price. Bundles encourage customers to buy more in one order. Product bundles drive up the average order value (AOV) by encouraging customers to purchase more items in one go. For example, Apple’s holiday strategy includes exclusive bundles with premium services, targeting loyal users with limited-time offers, proving that even simple bundles can feel high-end with the right positioning. Source: KennyLee Creative Make the bundles feel exclusive (limited supply or exclusive items) and wrapped in festive packaging or imagery. For example, group best-selling items together or curate gifts around a theme like “Gifts for Her” or “Gourmet Food Basket.” CleverTap can help here by recommending bundles to customers based on their past purchases or browsing behavior, or by sending targeted emails promoting bundles to those who have shown interest in similar products. Occasionally run surprise flash sales or “lightning deals” on key days during Christmas marketing campaigns. Because these are on a very short deadline (hours or a day), they tap into shoppers’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Limited-time offers with a ticking clock get people to act fast. Promote flash sales aggressively: use site banners, social media posts, and especially SMS or push alerts to ensure customers see the deal immediately. CleverTap can orchestrate these multi-channel blasts, allowing you to reach email, push, and social channels simultaneously and follow up with reminders. Because timing is key, set up countdown timers on pages and send alerts at the sale’s midpoint and final hour. Offer free shipping on holiday orders (possibly with a minimum threshold) and emphasize hassle-free returns. Free shipping is one of the most powerful incentives: around 60% of shoppers will add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping. Prominently advertise “Free Shipping” on banner ads, email subject lines, and product pages. Extend your return window as well, reassuring customers that any gifts that don’t fit can be returned in January at no additional cost. From an operational view, free returns are also important: 45% of consumers rank free return shipping as most important to them. Give your online store a seasonal look. Update homepage banners, product images, and CTAs with a holiday theme (think snowflakes, twinkling lights, or red-and-green color schemes). Change button text to holiday calls-to-action (“Shop Holiday Gifts” instead of “Shop Now”). These visual cues signal to visitors that they’re in a festive shopping environment. A themed site also feels fresh and can boost engagement. (Don’t forget holiday-specific SEO – e.g., update meta titles/descriptions to include keywords like “Christmas sale,” “holiday gifts,” etc.) Give your logo, product images, or packaging a limited-edition holiday twist. Even a slight seasonal makeover can make your brand more shareable on social. Iconic examples prove the power of this: Starbucks’ annual red holiday cup (introduced in 1997) became a cultural touchpoint signaling the start of the holiday season. Source: Forbes Similarly, Hershey’s Kisses added red-and-green foil wrappers and holiday ads, cementing their image as a holiday staple. Source: Herseyland You can do the same at your scale. Add Santa hats to your logo, wrap products in festive-themed boxes, or create holiday gift tags. When packaging looks gift-ready, customers are more likely to share photos on social media, amplifying your reach. Pick an overarching theme or narrative for your Christmas marketing. For example, run a “12 Days of Gifting” campaign, a Santa’s workshop theme, or a winter wonderland story. This theme should tie together your emails, social posts, ads, and on-site banners. For example, WestJet Airlines created a heartwarming “Christmas Miracle” narrative. They set up a video Santa to ask passengers what they wanted, then secretly bought everyone’s wishes and delivered the gifts on the baggage carousel. The whole event was filmed as a story and went massively viral (27+ million YouTube views in one week). Source: WestJet Christmas Miracle: Real-time Giving Story-driven campaigns make messaging cohesive and memorable. Each email or social post can continue the story (Day 1: “Santa’s stocking stuffers – 20% off!”; Day 2: “Elves’ favorite toys – buy one, get one”). A consistent theme reinforces your brand’s holiday voice. Craft a special holiday email series tailored to customer segments. Send promotional emails based on behavior: for instance, if a customer looked at winter coats, email them a curated gift guide of related items. If another customer was a frequent buyer last holiday, give them a VIP early access deal. Personalize subject lines (“[Name], unwrap your 20% off gift inside!”) and content by recipient. Segment your lists (e.g., “Frequent buyers”, “Browsers of category X”) and send each a custom holiday message. For example, you could send “Gifts for Tech Lovers” to gadget-seekers and “Gifts Under $50” to budget shoppers. For example, Travelodge’s festive email invited users to “Make a Wish This Christmas” for a chance to win a 2025 trip, combining seasonal visuals, interactive elements, and segmented travel suggestions by season. A smart blend of personalization and engagement to drive early bookings. Source: ReallyGoodEmails CleverTap’s email automation and segmentation make this easy: it can pull user attributes like past purchases or interest tags to populate email content and ensure each shopper sees relevant product suggestions. Leverage user-generated content with holiday-themed social media contests. For instance, challenge followers to share a photo of themselves with your product in a festive setting, using a branded holiday hashtag (e.g., #MyBrandGift). Or run a “12 Days of Christmas Wish List” challenge: each day, invite customers to comment with their holiday wishlist item from your store for a chance to win it. These interactive posts boost engagement and spread brand visibility. Encourage participants by offering small prizes (like a coupon code or free gift) for the best or most creative entry. Remember to repost the best entries on your own channels; it increases reach and adds authenticity. For example, Starbucks launched a #RedCupContest on Instagram where customers were invited to post creative photos of the seasonal red cup. One year, Starbucks received over 24,000 entries in just 5 days during the contest. Source: People Magazine Build fun, interactive web pages or microsites to engage visitors. Ideas include a “spin-the-wheel” discount game, a festive quiz (“Which Holiday Gift Suits You?”), or a digital advent calendar that reveals a coupon or product each day. Gamification can significantly boost engagement and conversions. In fact, research has found that 60% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a brand that includes a gamified experience, and conversion rates can jump up to 7X higher with game-like widgets. For example, a spin-to-win pop-up (“Spin Santa’s Wheel for Your Discount!”) rewards users with a random discount or freebie in exchange for an email signup. These interactive elements make shopping fun and encourage visitors to stay on your site longer. Sephora introduced a holiday “Gift Finder” quiz on its site. Visitors answer questions about the gift recipient and budget, and the quiz suggests products. They promoted the feature via Instagram and saw huge success. Source: Sephora Indonesia Capitalize on the popularity of short-form video. Create holiday-themed video content for ads and social reels (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts). This could be a heartwarming story featuring your product as a gift, a quick demo of a holiday deal, or even a lighthearted Christmas jingle. Vertical videos with cheerful holiday music get high engagement on social feeds. For example, a restaurant might film quick clips of festive table settings and specials, or a clothing brand could showcase “Outfit ideas for Christmas parties” in a fast montage. Keep videos short (15–30 seconds) with a clear call to action (e.g., “Shop Now” or “Learn More”). Pair them with holiday hashtags and target them carefully using demographics/interests. Coca-Cola is a great example. Their 2024 “Share the Magic” holiday campaign had TikTok and Instagram influencers sharing personal holiday moments featuring Coca-Cola. They incorporated Coca-Cola’s iconic holiday assets (the vintage Santa, the red trucks) in these bite-sized videos to tap into nostalgia while reaching younger viewers on Reels. Source: Social Storis Publish curated gift guides targeted by shopper persona or recipient. For example: “Gifts for Him,” “Gifts for Kids,” “Gifts Under $25,” “Tech Lover’s Holiday Picks,” etc. Place these guides on your site or as separate landing pages, and link to them in your ads and emails. CleverTap can help personalize this even further. For instance, when a user in-app or on-site browses a category (say, beauty products), you could dynamically show the “Gifts for Her” guide as a suggested page. Gift guides not only simplify shopping, but they also give more exposure to your products. Send customers to the appropriate guide via segmented emails: e.g., email your fashion-loyal customers with “Holiday Style Gift Guide” and your gadget fans with “Best Tech Gifts.” This targeted approach can significantly increase conversions, since shoppers find gifts relevant to their needs. Wishlists make holiday shopping fun and viral: customers can build a list of items they want and easily send it to family and friends. Ensure your site or app supports sharing (via email, social media, or direct link) and display a “Most Wished For” carousel on your homepage. When someone shares a wishlist, you gain new potential customers (friends/family). Wishlists also give you valuable data about what people want. If a user adds an item to a wishlist, you could later send a reminder (“Hey, [Name], items on your wishlist are going fast – get 10% off them today!”). Following up with customers about items on their wishlist – especially if stock is low or a sale is ending – significantly boosts conversions. Amazon popularized this with its shareable Wish Lists. For the holidays, they even introduced a dedicated “Holiday Gift List” feature so families can aggregate gift ideas in one place and share the link around. Source: Amazon Reward and motivate customers who shop early. Offer an “early bird” discount or bonus gift for purchases made in October or early November. For example, a “Halloween to Black Friday” sale pass, or a limited-time code “EARLYXMAS” for 15% off purchases made by November 15. This not only drives early sales (helping you plan inventory and revenue) but also prevents waiting shoppers from drifting to competitors later. For Christmas marketing, CleverTap can identify customers who have previously purchased and automatically target them with these exclusive pre-holiday deals via push or email. Remind all subscribers with email campaigns highlighting inventory or shipping deadlines. Send customers a heartfelt holiday greeting (digital or even printed mailer) with a personalized touch and a coupon. A simple “Happy Holidays, and thank you for shopping with us” message can go a long way. Beyond just text, consider adding a small gift, such as a unique promo code or coupon, inside the card. This makes customers feel valued as individuals, not just revenue sources. With CleverTap’s Promos, you an make this happen easily. Handwritten notes or limited-edition printed postcards (sent to top customers) can also create a memorable “wow” moment during Christmas marketing campaigns. Either way, the aim is to strengthen loyalty by making customers feel appreciated during the season. Chewy, the pet supplies retailer, is renowned for sending actual handwritten holiday cards to its customers. They employ a whole team of card-writers to pen personal notes thanking customers (often including something personal like the pet’s name). Source: X.com Use CleverTap’s automation to trigger thank-you notes at scale: for instance, after a November purchase, you could send a “Thank You for Your Support – Enjoy 10% Off Next Order!” holiday email. Another Christmas marketing idea is to leverage the holiday goodwill by launching a seasonal referral bonus. Reward customers who refer friends and family with holiday-themed incentives. For example, “Give $10, Get $10” gift cards or double reward points if a new customer buys a gift. Make it a win-win: the referrer gets a reward, and the friend also enjoys a welcome discount. Promote the referral offer in your emails, app, and on receipts (“Refer a friend this holiday and you’ll both get $10 off!”). During Christmas, people love recommending gifts. You’re just amplifying word-of-mouth in a measurable way. Run a Christmas-themed giveaway to boost engagement and follower counts. For example, host a social media contest: “Win a $100 Gift Box from us” by liking, sharing, or tagging friends. Alternatively, a photo contest like “Most Festive Decorated Tree” or “Coziest Winter Workspace” featuring your products. Contests create buzz, user-generated content, and excitement around your brand. Make sure the prize is something attractive (perhaps one of your bundles or gift cards). Collect entries and emails (with permission) so you can notify winners. Featuring user photos as part of the contest also builds social proof. Team up with influencers or bloggers for holiday gift roundups. Identify micro-influencers in your niche (e.g., parenting, tech, beauty) and send them a curated holiday gift set. Have them unbox or review the products on social media or YouTube, ideally in a Christmas-themed video (e.g., “Top 5 Holiday Gifts I’m Giving” featuring your products). Alo Yoga did a special holiday collaboration: they released a limited Advent Calendar box of goodies and sent it to wellness influencers, who then unboxed one item each day on TikTok and Instagram. Those influencer videos not only reviewed the products but also built excitement day by day. Source: Alo Yoga Influencers’ authentic recommendations can reach highly targeted audiences. Provide them with a unique discount code to share, creating urgency for their followers. Partner with another brand or artist for a co-branded holiday product or bundle. For example, a fashion retailer might team up with a local accessory designer to create a limited-edition holiday ornament or scarf. Such collaborations generate press and social media interest. Promote the special product jointly in both partners’ marketing channels and offer it as a gift idea. Even a small co-branding (e.g., a custom gift card design with a local artist) can add novelty. CleverTap can assist by creating segments of customers who like either brand and sending them announcements about the new launch, maximizing reach across both customer bases. “Give back” campaigns resonate deeply at Christmas. For instance, run a “buy one, donate one” promotion (e.g., for every product sold, you donate the same item to charity) or pledge a percentage of holiday revenue to a cause. Customers feel good about purchasing when they know it helps someone else. Promote this heavily: add a banner like “This Holiday, Every Purchase Helps [Cause]” on your site. A great campaign idea is to let customers choose between several charities at checkout and match their choice. Not only does this increase goodwill, but it also encourages buyers who prioritize ethical brands. The more visible the campaign (social posts, emails, site banners), the more it amplifies both the impact and your brand’s feel-good story. For example, Lego’s annual #BuildToGive campaign asks fans to build a Lego ornament and share it; for each one posted, Lego donates a set to a child in need. Source: Lego Incorporate local or community elements into your holiday marketing. For example, you could highlight artwork from local artists on your holiday cards or use photos of your local team prepping for Christmas (if appropriate). Feature stories about how your business is celebrating with the community. By foregrounding a local angle (e.g., “Made in [Your City] with love” or “Local artisans in our holiday market”), you tap into that trend. Host a local pop-up event or collaborate with a neighborhood charity, and share it on social. These efforts humanize your brand and can foster loyalty from customers who value community impact. Use clever follow-ups to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers. For everyone who purchased during the Christmas season, send a thank-you email or in-app note in early January. Include a New Year coupon or free shipping code to entice another purchase. Showing appreciation after the fact builds loyalty. A simple “Thank you for your support – enjoy 15% off your next order” goes a long way. Schedule these as automated flows in CleverTap so that every holiday buyer enters a post-purchase sequence. You can also use behavioral triggers, such as offering early access to your January sales to customers who have made multiple holiday purchases. This recency-based outreach keeps your brand top-of-mind and can turn satisfied holiday shoppers into regulars. CleverTap provides the personalization and automation backbone to scale these ideas. Its platform unifies customer data and engagement across push, in-app, email, SMS, and more. For example, CleverTap can create user segments (by location, purchase history, or holiday affinity) and automate tailored campaigns: sending a “12 Days of Deals” push series to one group, while emailing “Gifts for Her” guides to another. Features like behavioral triggers and real-time analytics enable you to instantly remarket to a wishlist user, trigger a cart abandonment email, or send a holiday thank-you flow with minimal manual effort. Many brands use CleverTap to send millions of holiday notifications at peak times, ensuring personalized offers reach the right customers. CleverTap helps you plan, personalize, and perfect your Christmas campaigns. It handles large holiday traffic with built-in scalability, and its reporting lets you see which strategies are driving sales and where to tweak.

Title: Nvidia on track to become world's most valuable company
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0704/1521822-nvidia-on-track-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/
Time Published: 2025-07-04T09:08:55Z
Full Content:
Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion yesterday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4% to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5% at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7% to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the UK. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28% of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Title: Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia lead Wall Street’s AI revolution

Nvidia touched a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly overtaking Apple's record valuation. Its stock climbed as high as $160.98 in early trade before settling at $159.60, placing its valuation at $3.89 trillion—just short of Apple’s all-time high of $3.915 trillion from December 2024.(Source: Reuters) Investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence continues to surge, with Nvidia at the center of this wave. Its high-end chips are now essential for training advanced AI models, making the company a prime beneficiary of the current AI investment cycle. Tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla are racing to build out AI data centers. This has created unprecedented demand for Nvidia’s processors. Microsoft’s market cap stands at $3.7 trillion, while Apple, now in third place, is valued at $3.19 trillion. Nvidia’s transformation has been dramatic. From a valuation of $500 billion in 2021, the company’s worth has soared nearly eight-fold, nearing the $4 trillion mark. It’s now more valuable than the entire Canadian and Mexican stock markets combined and surpasses the market cap of all UK-listed companies. Despite the explosive stock gains, Nvidia trades at about 32 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. That’s actually below its five-year average of 41, signaling that earnings estimates are rising even faster than its share price. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded over 68% since their April low, which followed market fears around President Trump’s global tariff plans. Optimism around potential trade deals has helped ease concerns, reigniting investor confidence. As Nvidia becomes increasingly dominant, its influence is spreading across the broader market. The company now makes up 7% of the S&P 500. Together with Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, these tech giants comprise 28% of the entire index, impacting millions of retirement portfolios. Despite the enthusiasm, some experts urge caution. Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners warns that while AI is a powerful productivity tool, the current models—especially large language and reasoning models—may fall short of expectations. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Nvidia started as a niche GPU company for video games. Today, it has become Wall Street’s go-to indicator for the AI sector, even replacing Intel in the Dow Jones index in a landmark shift for the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia’s future looks bright, challenges remain. In January, a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, shook markets with a cheaper model that outperformed Western rivals. If such trends continue, spending on high-end processors could come under pressure. However, Nvidia’s momentum and strategic positioning still keep it ahead of the curve.
