Bond yields fell as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his case for a July rate cut, while data showed consumer expectations for inflation improved. Stocks wavered amid earnings. President Donald Trump signed the stablecoins bill in a win for the crypto industry. Short-dated Treasuries led gains as Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold rates steady in July. Bonds also rose as University of Michigan data showed consumers expect prices to increase at an annual rate of 4.4% over the next year, down from 5% in the prior month. The S&P 500 was little changed. The dollar edged lower, but notched an advance for the week. “Investors have something to cheer about with signs of improved inflation expectations,” said Jeff Roach at LPL Financial. “According to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging.” Meantime, Waller said he sees no sign that inflation expectations are on the rise, which allows the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. He also restated the case the Fed should cut when policymakers gather later this month, given data suggesting the US labor market is “on the edge.” “We think he is correct. The Fed’s role is to think ahead, not look behind, which is what Waller is doing concerning the slowing employment situation,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Nonetheless a July cut won’t happen.” Money markets still assign near-zero odds of a cut on July 30. They price in about 45 basis points of easing by year-end, down from more than 65 basis points at the start of the month. US consumer sentiment rose to a five-month high in early July as expectations about the economy continued to improve. The preliminary July sentiment index rose to 61.8 from 60.7 a month earlier, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. The report offered further relief after data this week showed US retail sales rebounded in June in a broad advance, tempering some concerns about a retrenchment in consumer spending. To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, macroeconomic data remains broadly supportive, and the recent strength in markets has been impressive, though perhaps even more noteworthy is the prevailing sense of calm amid a busy and often volatile news cycle. “Investors have responded positively to robust economic indicators and earnings reports that highlight continued resilience in US consumer spending,” he said. “The rest of earnings season will be a key test given elevated valuations and expectations, though with current momentum and sentiment, the path of least resistance is higher.” At Wolfe Research, Chris Senyek says economic data releases this week have been consistent with his view that the US economy is coming in better than consensus expects. “However, we continue to be worried about the risk of inflation remaining stickier than expected in the back half of 2025,” Senyek noted. The stock market’s relatively modest gains this week despite mostly solid economic data and earnings could be a preview for much of the rest of the year, according to Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team. “While tariff uncertainty continues, the markets may be learning to live with it, to a certain extent,” he said. “But with a decisive resolution unlikely in the near term and the Fed holding the line on rate cuts, price action at the index level could remain congested.” Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US’s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times reported. Meantime, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the two nations could reach a “good” trade deal while signaling the process may take more time. “The lack of any clear damage from the tariffs, solid earnings results, a firm job market, and consumers who keep spending are supporting the high valuations,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. The Food and Drug Administration plans to ask Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. to pause shipments of its Elevidys treatment after three deaths were linked to the company’s gene therapies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Humana Inc. lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments, a blow for the insurer that had hoped the court would restore billions in revenue. American Express Co.’s expenses grew in the second quarter as the firm made risk-management investments for its affluent consumers, who continued to spend amid economic uncertainty. Netflix Inc. beat expectations for second-quarter results and continues to trounce rival media companies, yet the shares slipped on Friday as investors took a pause after the stock has nearly doubled over the past year. 3M Co. raised its profit forecast and beat Wall Street’s estimates for the second quarter as Chief Executive Officer William Brown’s effort to reinvigorate the company gained momentum. Chevron Corp. has prevailed in a 20-month fight to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, overcoming a challenge by arch rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that was unprecedented in the modern history of Big Oil. SLB, the world’s largest oil-services provider, sees resiliency in the industry and remains constructive about the second half of 2025 despite uncertainties in customer demand. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. reported total net interest income for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. Charles Schwab Corp. reported earnings per share that topped estimates as the firm said client assets hit a new record and trading revenue rose. Ally Financial Inc. left most of its forecast unchanged despite strong second-quarter consumer auto-loan originations and earnings. Meta Platforms Inc. said it won’t sign the code of practice for Europe’s new set of laws governing artificial intelligence, calling the guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act overreach. The S&P 500 was little changed as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 was little changed The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% The MSCI World Index was little changed Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 0.7% The Russell 2000 Index fell 0.6% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1622 The British pound was little changed at $1.3413 The Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 148.73 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $117,433.01 Ether rose 3.9% to $3,554.18 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.43% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.70% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 4.67% The yield on 2-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 3.87% The yield on 30-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 5.00% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $67.38 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,348.06 an ounce

Title: Tiger Global Billionaire Abruptly Dumps Nvidia, Pours $334,000,000 Into Surging US Asset

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that:(i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon;(ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors;(iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions;(iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability;(v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and(vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

Pluribus Unum Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds. In practice, it is GIGO. Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. 8 posted on 07/18/2025 11:16:13 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy.

Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. 19 posted on 07/18/2025 11:38:15 AM PDT by roadcat ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: TexasGator What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right. 20 posted on 07/18/2025 11:45:07 AM PDT by Sequoyah101 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-45 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

"So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money. One more thing, restoring and recommissioning old nuclear plants to feed the server or data farms? No risk in that is there? Anything is possible if you can get your hands on enough of OPM. It becomes all about he multiples and keeping the show attractive. On the other side of the equation though, I asked google what dividend stocks to invest in for long term income. Three out of the four named are the same ones I spent days doing research and screening to find and ultimately bought. The citations given were complete, current and mostly well reasoned. Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get. Just wish I had bought more of them. However, like one of my landmen said, “25% of a good deal is probably enough.” He made Billy Bob look like the yokel that he really is. Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

July 18, 2025 08:49 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, July 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024 and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #NAPCO Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Posted on July 18, 2025 by Nick Roach 2 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 19. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 17 and 18, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 121 bug fixes and improvements, five new features, including Flexbox Layouts, Interactions, Improved Backward Compatibility, Relative Colors, and Find and Replace, and made significant progress on two upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, almost every team has finished their features and is now focused on fixing bugs in preparation for the upcoming public beta. You can expect bug fixes to ramp up over the next month, with a new focus on testing and fixing migration-related issues. In addition to all the little bug fixes, Public Alpha 19 also comes with a few minor improvements: Of course, these minor improvements don’t include all the big features we introduced, so keep reading to learn about those! We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.2. 🎉 Divi 5’s new Flexbox layout system has arrived. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was left unturned, no option was forgotten—we did it all, and it’s best in class. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.1. 🎉 Interactions is a robust system for creating interactive elements such as popups and toggles, and creative scroll-based and mouse-movement-based effects. It’s not a pop-up builder; it’s an anything builder. Create a trigger, assign an effect, choose a target, and bring your custom interactions to life. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18. 🎉 We’ve been testing all the top-selling products in the Divi Marketplace and improving Divi 5’s backward compatibility system so that, when the time comes, everyone will be able to upgrade. With the improved backward compatibility update, legacy modules are now available in the Add Module panel and will function much better than before. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17.1. 🎉 Divi’s color revolution has arrived, positioning Divi as the clear leader in color management and advanced color systems. 🎉 Divi’s color picker has been completely redesigned, and it doesn’t get any better. Using HSL, you can create mathematically beautiful, variable-based color systems that are easy to manage, revolutionizing how you manage colors on your websites. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17. 🎉 Find and Replace is an impressive efficiency tool for Divi power users that will speed up your workflow and play an essential role in helping old websites adopt Divi 5’s new design systems, such as variables. Right-click on any field to find and replace its value within a given scope. It’s a simple concept, but boy, is it useful, and it’s not something you’ll find in most page builders. 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder last month, and it’s almost finished. Our goal is to release it next week! The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. Our first batch of WooCommerce product modules is almost finished and will be the next feature we release after Loop Builder. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 17 through Public Alpha 19. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~1.5 months based on our progress; 2-3 weeks to wrap up Loop Builder and Woo Modules, followed by a few weeks of focused bug fixing. There are two things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and the majority of our team is now focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback.

Title: Ads of the Week: Duck boats, Chalamet quirks, milk musicals and ketchup devotion

Full Content:
Advertisement July 18, 2025 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min When hot dogs steal the show, duck boats double as training films, and Timothée Chalamet shops for cattle feed, you know advertising is having a week. These campaigns prove that wit, weirdness, and well-placed heart can turn everyday products into cultural side characters worth rooting for. 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way / Chesapeake Bank Why it works: It tosses out the usual banking tropes in favor of local charm, employee cameos, and a duck boat to prove community banking doesn’t have to be boring. To celebrate 125 years in business, Chesapeake Bank teamed up with agency Familiar Creatures for a campaign that is part ad, part onboarding film, and fully committed to authenticity. Titled 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way, the centerpiece is a 1:45 minute hero spot filmed aboard a duck boat cruising through small-town Virginia, starring actual employees and local characters. Rather than lean on stock footage or corporate buzzwords, the campaign embraces oddball humor and lo-fi storytelling. With nods to Wes Anderson, the spot doubles as a real onboarding video for new hires, highlighting the bank’s values through crochet references, desk décor, and real-life crab cake stunts. The duck boat driver is the actual owner. The crab cake is a 400-pound beast served to baseball fans in Richmond. From social clips like Is That a Duck Boat? to bite-sized 30- and 15-second cutdowns, the campaign taps into regional pride with a knowing wink. It’s a rare example of a financial brand leading with personality over polish, proving that relatability and local flavor can still break through in a category built on sameness. Why it works: It skips fintech jargon in favor of surreal humor and star power, making people curious about money in a fresh way. Cash App’s newest ad taps into Timothée Chalamet’s signature eccentricity. The actor wanders a store filled with strange produce before selecting a mangelwurzel, an obscure root vegetable often used as animal feed. When he tries to pay, the scene shifts into a generational debate about outdated currencies like salt and cowrie shells. The two-minute spot was developed by Cash App’s in-house team, directed by Aidan Zamiri, and written by Elijah Bynum. It’s airing in theaters ahead of Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, with OOH placements in New York and Los Angeles. A co-designed limited-edition Cash App Card stamp with Chalamet is also on the way. It’s a stylized, offbeat campaign that avoids the usual product pitch and instead makes a cultural statement about how we think and talk about money. Why it works: It turns the daily grind of motherhood into a stage-worthy performance, with milk as the quiet but powerful co-star. MilkPep’s latest campaign, Mom’s Show Must Go On, is a high-energy tribute to moms who juggle snack time, tantrums and living-room dance breaks like pros. Rolled out across TikTok, Netflix, Meta and YouTube, the campaign embraces the humor and mess of parenting while drawing a direct line to milk’s role in keeping moms going. Created by agency Gale, the work casts mothers as lead performers in the everyday theater of home life, with kids as their discerning audience. The creative blends relatable chaos with playful spectacle, making milk feel less like a nutritional box to check and more like a backstage essential. The campaign follows MilkPep’s recent efforts to keep dairy relevant in modern culture, trading nostalgia for emotional honesty and short-form storytelling. It’s a smart shift that connects with parents on a personal level while quietly reinforcing milk’s value. Advertisement Why it works: It turns a safety concern into a simple, actionable idea that empowers parents without talking down to them. Tesco Mobile’s latest campaign addresses a growing gap between generations. As digital slang evolves, nearly half of parents and caregivers admit they struggle to understand the way kids communicate online. To bridge that gap, the brand launched a series of outdoor, radio, and digital ads that decode terms commonly used by young people—some of which may carry more serious meanings than they appear. Created by BBH London, the campaign builds on cultural momentum around online safety, sparked in part by Netflix’s Adolescence, which highlighted how emojis and casual slang can hide risky behavior. The goal is to help parents feel more confident, equipping them to spot red flags and open conversations with their kids. By packaging digital literacy into a clear, creative format, Tesco Mobile positions itself as more than a service provider, it becomes a partner in parenting. It transforms sustainability from a feature into a full-blown creative concept that feels fun, not preachy. To launch its new upcycled ‘Stracciatella Saddle,’ Italian cycling brand Selle Royal leaned into whimsy with a musical stop-motion film that spotlights circular design. Built from discarded saddle materials and foam offcuts, the saddle’s marbled pattern recalls the classic stracciatella gelato—making a virtue of its recycled roots. Created by Milan-based agency Adverteam, the campaign centers on Stracciatella Fella, a frame-by-frame animated film crafted from over 2,000 photographs. Using miniature sets, clay figures, and actual recycled foam fragments, the spot turns reuse into a story of reinvention. The campaign is a smart example of how eco-conscious innovation can be marketed through entertainment rather than education, giving Selle Royal cultural texture and personality in a category that often plays it safe. Advertisement Why it works: It captures a universal truth with humor and clarity: when the food hits just right, nothing else matters. In Lost in Love, Heinz’s latest European campaign, a tennis fan is completely absorbed in his ketchup-covered hot dog, tuning out the match around him as if the world has disappeared. The moment is simple, funny, and instantly relatable. Developed by Wieden+Kennedy and Heinz’s in-house agency The Kitchen, the campaign is rolling out across the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Italy. It is the first time Heinz has launched a campaign simultaneously across its European markets, with a consistent presence on TV, social and out-of-home. By focusing on one irresistible moment of taste, the work reinforces Heinz's brand promise without overexplaining. It is product-led storytelling with just the right amount of charm. Why it works: It strips away the usual supermarket noise and replaces it with quiet, human moments that feel instantly familiar. In a category packed with price flashes and glossy product shots, Ocado’s Shopping List Stories takes a softer approach. Created by Uncommon Creative Studio, the campaign pairs understated shopping lists with emotionally resonant images, from a blurred photo of a handhold to snapshots of birthdays, breakups, and everything in between. Each list hints at a deeper story. One simply reads: “One tin of Ocado Gold Roast Instant Coffee. Zero words.” It’s minimalist, but it lands with unexpected weight. This outdoor-focused campaign isn’t trying to shout louder than its competitors. Instead, it invites viewers to pause, connect, and remember that behind every grocery order is a life being lived. That shift in tone makes Ocado feel more thoughtful and more human without ever needing to show a price tag. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: A second-generation molecular clamp stabilised bivalent candidate vaccine for protection against diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312

Full Content:
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two medically important causes of respiratory tract infections and diseases. After more than five decades of research and development, vaccines have recently been approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, vaccines for hMPV remain in early-stage development. Here we describe the design and characterisation as well as pre-clinical development of a bivalent vaccine, VXB-241, comprised of the recombinantly expressed viral fusion proteins from both RSV and hMPV, stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the second-generation molecular clamp (MC2S) and key pre-fusion stabilizing mutations. Each of the two antigens were produced at high yield in a mammalian expression system and purified by an affinity capture resin specific to MC2S. Each antigen was demonstrated to adopt the pre-fusion conformation, which was stable for at least twelve months in liquid formulation at 2–8°C. Head-to-head evaluation in mouse immunogenicity studies showed that the VXB-241 candidate vaccine induced a neutralising immune response that was superior or equivalent to the pre-fusion stabilised comparator antigens for either RSV or hMPV, including the RSVPreF3 antigen of the licensed RSV vaccine, Arexvy (GSK). The results presented here have supported progression of VXB-241 into a Phase 1 clinical trial which commenced enrolment in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06556147). A second-generation molecular clamp was used to help lock viral glycoproteins in a stabilised native prefusion conformation to elicit highly protective immunity and to enable consistent manufacture of highly stable, ready-to-use, fully liquid vaccines. The first- and second-generation molecular clamp platforms were previously validated in two successful Phase 1 clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (NCT04495933 and NCT05775887). This work is the first presentation of the pre-clinical development of a multi-pathogen vaccine, VXB-241 targeting both RSV and hMPV. The two antigens (VXB-213 and VXB-221) were shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 2–8°C and are able to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV in mouse immunogenicity study. VXB-241 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06556147). Citation: Young A, Kolekar S, Mendoza CA, Jaberolansar N, Modhiran N, Webb T, et al.

RSV was discovered in 1956 and causes infections at all ages and is a major cause of severe illness, especially for infants and older adults. There are 2 major antigenic subtypes of human RSV (A and B). By 2 years of age, virtually all children will have been infected with RSV. RSV is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, the epidemiology of RSV shows high incidence of RSV hospitalisation among older patients as well as high risk for severe disease in immunocompromised adults [1]. Long-term care facility residents are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks and serious illness [2]. RSV burden of severe disease may be comparable to influenza [1]. Since the discovery of hMPV in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. Through genetic analysis hMPV has been characterised into 2 groups A and B which are further divided into 4 sub-lineages [3]. hMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. hMPV is associated with acute lower respiratory infections and can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Overall, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are like those in RSV infection [4]. Although nearly all populations will experience primary hMPV infection by age 5, hMPV re-infection occurs throughout adult life. Rates of hospitalisation of children for hMPV infection are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Pre-existing conditions, particularly asthma, play a role in disease severity and hospitalisation [5]. It has been documented that both RSV and hMPV have a high incidence rate and burden of illness, especially amongst susceptible populations including newborns, young children under 5 years of age, older adults, elderly and immunocompromised host. In children under five years of age, RSV infections were estimated to cause per year 33 million acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and to be associated to 3.6 million hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths worldwide [6]. Within the paediatric population globally in 2018, hMPV infection was estimated to be the cause per year of 11 million ALRI cases, 502,000 hospitalisations and 11,300 deaths [7]. In older adults over the age of 60, RSV infection is estimated to account for 5.2 million ALRIs, 470,000 hospitalisations and 33,000 deaths in high-income countries alone [8]. Within the older adult population, the burden of disease caused by hMPV has been less intensely studied, however there is an increased availability and implementation of molecular assays in clinical practice to analyse the virus causing lower respiratory tract disease [9]. Recent studies, conducted in the US and several countries worldwide, have shown that RSV and hMPV are similarly related to acute respiratory diseases, with similar reported percentage of virus detection, hospitalisations and deaths in susceptible populations [10]. After more than 5 decades of research and development [11,12], three vaccines have recently been approved in Europe, the USA and elsewhere for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults: two subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13] and Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14], and a mRNA vaccine, MRESVIA (Moderna) [15]. Abrysvo has also received approval for vaccination during pregnancy for the protection of infants against RSV throughout the first six months following birth [16]. Each vaccine has demonstrated high levels of protective efficacy and favourable safety in their respective target populations [13–16]. The transformational discovery at the heart of these advances has been the recognition that during the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, glycoprotein F transitions irreversibly from a pre-fusion (RSV preF) to a post-fusion (RSV postF) conformation. RSV preF is an unstable conformation that is able to elicit strong neutralising antibody (nAb) activity while the conformationally more stable RSV postF elicits poor nAb activity [17,18]. While there are no vaccines currently available for hMPV, a bivalent mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna targeting hMPV and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) has demonstrated potential to boost neutralisation responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial [19]. Moderna is currently conducting further clinical trials of a bivalent mRNA vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV. Icosavax, now part of AstraZeneca, is also developing a bivalent RSV-hMPV vaccine (IVX-A12), based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which has been demonstrated to boost neutralsing antibody titres against both RSV and hMPV by 3–5 fold [20]. As with RSV, the hMPV preF has been demonstrated to elicit a higher neutralising immune response than hMPV postF [21–24], however there are also some differences between the two viruses. For RSV most neutralising immune responses are specific to RSV preF [17,18], however for hMPV neutralising immune responses overlap between hMPV preF and postF [25–27], with some neutralising antibodies (nAbs) recognising epitopes on the internal trimer interface [25,28]. While the newly approved RSV vaccines have great potential to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce the burden on hospitals during peak RSV seasons, equitable distribution of ready-to-use vaccine formulations remains a significant barrier to access these important vaccines, especially within LMICs. Both approved subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and MRESVIA, like other mRNA vaccines, is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration, cannot be refrozen and must be discarded if not used within 24 hours of thawing [14]. Such requirements complicate real world use. Costly manufacturing and distribution requirements also likely add to the price per dose for these vaccines, impacting global supply and equitable access. A further challenge exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) as vaccination compliance becomes more challenging. The prospect of adding further vaccines to cover and protect against high burden respiratory diseases caused by other viruses such as hMPV and PIV into the current schedule will increase compliance challenges. To address this medical need, multivalent vaccines will be of increased importance and will require developing stable antigens that can be combined in one vaccine. In this work, we describe the development and pre-clinical evaluation of a bivalent candidate vaccine (VXB-241) to provide protection against RSV and hMPV ALRIs. VXB-241 is composed of two antigens: RSV preF (VXB-213) and hMPV preF (VXB-221). The two antigens are stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the proprietary second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp (MC2S) platform, which enables trimerisation and purification, and key pre-fusion stabilising mutations. The two candidate vaccine antigens show high production yield, liquid stability and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway with the key objective being the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). Following the finding in late 2020 that the immune response induced by a first-generation molecular clamp (MC)-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sclamp, interfered with some HIV diagnostic tests [29], the original MC platform was re-engineered to avoid the use of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41. A panel of candidate heptad repeat sequences was screened to identify those that form highly stable 6HB structures. Subsequent rounds of optimisation and testing led to the identification of molecular clamp 2 (MC2); details available WO2023187743. As HIV-1 gp41 derived sequences are not included in MC2, cross-reactivity to HIV diagnostics was not anticipated. However, given the similarities in quaternary structure, to rule this out an ELISA was conducted using two different reference serum samples readily available for HIV diagnostic testing. Testing via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both NIBSC HIV reference serum and BioRad Geenius HIV+ control serum revealed reactivity to MC but no detectable reactivity to MC2 (S1 Fig). Both MC and MC2 were compared, and tested with three different viral antigens that had been validated on the first-generation platform (antigen from SARS-CoV-2 [29], Nipah virus [30], influenza A virus [31]), as well as an early iteration of the RSV preF antigen that was in development. For the four antigens; comparable antigen homogeneity and oligomeric characteristics were conferred by MC and MC2, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (S2 Fig). Immunogenicity in mice was also compared, with sera from mice vaccinated with MC2 and MC2S stabilised antigens shown to elicit equivalent or superior levels of neutralising immune responses compared to MC (S3 Fig). The second-generation clamp was further developed to incorporate additional N-linked glycosylation sites to dampen immunogenicity, referred to as Molecular Clamp 2 Silenced (MC2S). RSV preF incorporating MC2S was compared to MC and MC2, with antigen homogeneity again shown to be comparable and superior neutralising immune responses elicited in mice compared to MC (S2 and S3 Figs). The effect of silencing was demonstrated by comparing the immune response in mice after vaccination with RSV F antigen containing either MC, MC2 or MC2S. The relative percentage of elicited IgG binding to MC2S was reduced by >2-fold from a geometric mean of 34.3% for MC2 to 15.8% for MC2S (S4 Fig). To further determine whether there was any cross-reactivity to HIV gp41, sera from mouse vaccinated with either MC or MC2 stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analysed by ELISA against HIV gp41. The MC2 stabilised spike elicited approximately 38-fold lower cross-reactivity compared to MC, essentially at, or near the LoD of the assay (S5 Fig). The RSV and hMPV candidate vaccine antigens including MC2S were generated and analysed side by side with well characterised recombinant protein controls for comparison. Briefly, there were two categories of controls, controls that were classed as non-stabilised soluble controls (RSV Fsol and hMPV Fsol), and controls that were preF stabilised benchmark comparators with a foldon trimerisation domain (RSV DsCav1 [32], hMPV DsCavEs2 [21] and hMPV v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23]). From the new candidate vaccine antigens containing MC2S, one antigen has been selected for RSV, RSV preF, called VXB-213 and another for hMPV, hMPV preF, called VXB-221. VXB-213 was engineered to include the optimal disulfide bridge linkages and furin cleavage site deletion identified by McLellan et al., [32] and Joyce et al., [33], whereas VXB-221 included an unmodified TMPRSS2 cleavage site, a proline substitution and a single disulfide bridge [21,34]. The nomenclature with brief description of each antigen is summarised in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312.t001 At a research laboratory scale for antigen discovery purposes, the recombinant antigens were expressed as secretable proteins in mammalian suspension culture (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ExpiCHO-S, Thermofisher) and purified from clarified supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using either a ligand-resin with affinity for MC2S (AVI-8740) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral ectodomain. They were buffer exchanged into PBS and characterised by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex Increase 10 300 GL (Cytiva) SEC column (Fig 1). Both the RSV and hMPV antigen panels showed similar trends for their oligomerisation profiles, with the non-stabilised Fsol proteins producing the greatest proportion of aggregate (RSV Fsol, 94% aggregate, 0% trimer; hMPV Fsol, 25% aggregate, 19% trimer, 56% monomer), the MC2S-incorporating antigens showing high degrees of trimer homogeneity (>89% trimer for both VXB-213 and VXB-221) with the comparator antigens being intermediate to these two (RSV DSCav1, 69% trimer; hMPV DSCavEs2, 54% trimer). hMPV DsCavEs2 produced two overlapping peaks within the trimeric fractions, suggesting that the trimer may adopt distinct conformational or oligomeric states. This observation differs from the results reported by Hsieh et al., [22], where hMPV DSCavEs2 was expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells, in the presence of co-transfected Furin and an additional SEC purification step. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that RSV DSCav1 produced here in expiCHO-S (Thermofisher), may be conformationally different to that produced by McLellan et al., in HEK293K cells [32].

For the RSV antigens, ELISAs were performed in a sandwich format with antigens captured using a reformatted murine IgG2 isotype of Motavizumab [35] and probed with preF-specific human-type mAbs D25 [36], MPE8 [37] and AM14 [38]. For VXB-213 (Vicebio RSV preF) and the DsCav1 comparator, sub-nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) for all three mAbs were observed (Fig 1G). AM14 binds a preF, quaternary epitope and its binding to vaccine antigens has been correlated with protective immunity [38]. This mAb showed poor reactivity to the non-stabilised Fsol antigen, while binding VXB-213 with 8 picomolar KD; a 6-fold higher avidity relative to DsCav1. For the hMPV antigens, a broader panel of mAbs targeting diverse epitopes across the topology of preF was tested against the antigen series in an indirect ELISA format (Fig 1H). VXB-221 (Vicebio hMPV preF) was shown to be recognised with sub-nanomolar binding to five of the six mAbs tested. Only DS7 [39], which binds to the post-fusion conformation or a pre/post intermediate, showed low affinity for VXB-221. Neutralising antibodies with moderate or strong pre-fusion preference (MPV467, MPV-487 and MPE8) [37,40], showed similar sub-nanomolar affinities for VXB-221 and comparator antigens DSCavEs2 and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, but poor reactivity for hMPV Fsol. Neutralising antibodies known to recognise the internal trimer interface (MPV-458 and M8C10) [25,40], were able to bind with sub-nanomolar affinity to MPV-Fsol, DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 but showed poor affinity for v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, which contains an interprotomer disulphide bridge and has been optimised to adopt a closed, pre-fusion conformation [23]. Further analysis of the antigens by SDS-PAGE showed that the VXB-213 and VXB-221 were both highly pure and homogenous bands of predicted size for the non-cleaved products (S6 Fig). RSV Fsol and DsCav1 controls both showed a major band at the appropriate size for the furin cleaved product. hMPV Fsol showed a major band consistent with the non-cleaved product, DsCavEs2 also showed the presence of two major bands consistent with partial furin cleavage. All four controls exhibited some smearing that could be due to either impurities or proteolytic degradation. The ability of each antigen to deplete neutralising antibodies from a pooled human plasma sample was compared either by directly pre-incubating plasma with antigens in solution or with immobilised antigens coupled to CNBR Activated Sepharose (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous reports [17,18], RSV Fsol performed poorly at removing neutralising antibodies from human plasma, whereas both DSCav1 and VXB-213, were highly efficient at depleting neutralising antibodies (S7A Fig). DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 were also both able to efficiently deplete hMPV neutralising antibodies, although hMPV Fsol was not tested (S7B Fig). BALB/c mice were immunised with 2 µg of the recombinant antigens by intramuscular injection (IM) in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). To ensure RSV and hMPV Fsol antigens were fully in the post-fusion state they were first heated to 70°C for 2 hrs. At completion, analysis of mouse sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the immunisations had been effective in inducing IgG against each respective antigen. The bivalent candidate vaccine, VXB-241 (a combination of VXB-213 and VXB-221), elicited a response to both the RSV preF and hMPV preF antigens (Fig 2A). Each antigen also elicited a response to the trimer stabilising domain that was detectable via ELISA with a non-homologous antigen (Nipah F) stabilised with either foldon or MC2S. By comparing EC50 values for total antigen-specific IgG and tag-specific IgG for each mouse we were able to estimate the proportion of tag-specific response. This response was considered undesirable as it will not contribute to protection. For VXB-213 and VXB-221 the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S was found to be 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, while with the bivalent VXB-241 the relative response to MC2S was found to be 4.7% (Fig 2B). In comparison, for the RSV F DSCav1 the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was found to be 19.9%. For the hMPV F DSCavEs2 comparator, which also contains foldon, the geometric mean (GM) of the relative response to foldon was 3.1%. This response was somewhat variable with very low titres for 5 individual mice and relatively high titres for the remaining 3 mice. (A) Serum IgG titre to the RSV F antigens (blue), hMPV F antigens (purple), and the IgG titre specific to either the foldon or MC2S trimer stabilising domain (orange). Titres were determined by ELISA and expressed as EC50 values. (B) Relative proportion of foldon/MC2S reactivity calculated as a percentage of the total antigen specific titre. (C/D) Serum virus neutralisation titre determined in a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) against RSV A2 and hMPV (CAN97-83). Geometric means with geometric SD are plotted. Mann Whitney Test was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between VXB-213 and comparator DSCav1 and between VXB-221 and comparator DSCavEs2.

This analysis demonstrates that VXB-213, at a dose of 2 µg delivered twice, 3 weeks apart, induces a neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 489; 95%CI = 222–1208). The response to VXB-213 is equivalent to comparator antigen RSV F DSCav1 (GM = 475; 95%CI = 255–946), and approximately 10-fold higher to heat-treated RSV Fsol (GM = 59; 95%CI = 32–125). The analysis of neutralisation against hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) demonstrates that VXB-221 induces a neutralising immune response to hMPV (GM = 1384; 95%CI = 1094–1762). The neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 was 2.5-fold higher than comparator antigen hMPV F DSCavEs2 (GM = 558; 95%CI = 336–971) and approximately 5.5-fold higher to heat-treated hMPV Fsol (GM = 252; 95%CI = 99–778). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 to comparator hMPV F DSCavEs2 showed a highly significant difference (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.0003). The combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 (the selected RSV preF and hMPV preF) antigens mixed prior to injection in mouse, elicited a strong neutralising immune response against both RSV A2 (GM = 329; 95%CI = 171–687) and hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) (GM = 755; 95%CI = 543–1069). A larger scale 50L manufacturing scale production run was performed with the resulting antigens analysed and data compared. For this 50L scale production, stably transfected pools were generated for each antigen. High expression clonal cell lines for VXB-213 and VXB-221 were isolated from CHO K1 stable cell pools and a top clone was selected for production of two specific clonal cell banks. For each antigen an initial production batch was completed at 50L scale to generate material for use in the currently described mouse immunogenicity studies. Production of VXB-213 yielded 1.7 g/L and production of VXB-221 yielded 5.5g/L respectively compared to laboratory scale transient production using the ExpiCHO-S (Thermofisher). This corresponds to production level increases of 70- and 300-fold for VXB-213 and VXB-221, respectively. To assess antigen stability in a liquid formulation over time, a panel of assays was developed. This panel included monitoring for proteolytic degradation by Capillary Electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (CE-SDS), monitoring for the stability of the soluble trimer by Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and use of a capture ELISA based potency test for each antigen. For VXB-213 (RSV preF), the ELISA included the mAbs Motavizumab [41] to capture and AM14 [38] to probe and for VXB-221 (hMPV preF), DS7 [39] to capture and MPE8 [37] to probe. Stability assessment conducted over twelve months with VXB-213 and VXB-221, showed that both antigens retain >99% single product by CE-SDS, > 90% soluble trimer by SE-HPLC and no decrease in reactivity by Potency ELISA (S8 Fig). Material from the RSV preF (VXB-213) 50L batch was biochemically tested by SDS-PAGE alongside the current Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens. As these comparator antigens are distributed as a lyophilised powder, they were first reconstituted in PBS containing 0.05% PS80. Under reducing conditions, the VXB-213 and VXB-241 samples were highly pure with >95% product forming a single band at 60–70 kDa (S7 Fig). Both the Arexvy and Abrysvo antigens produced a major band between the 37 and 50 kDa markers with faint smearing of larger molecular weight products, and a secondary band slightly larger than 20 kDa. This appears to be consistent with near complete furin cleavage of the antigens. In addition to the above, the antigens manufactured at the 50L bioreactor scale were similarly tested for the induction of immunogenicity and neutralisation responses using BALB/c mice. This study involved two immunisations of either 0.5 µg or 3 µg of each antigen (RSVpreF3 from GSK’s RSV vaccine Arexvy, VXB-213, and VXB-221), or with either 1 µg or 6 µg of the combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 mixed prior mouse injection, called here VXB-241. Two doses were given, 3 weeks apart, all adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invitrogen). Three weeks after the second dose, serum was collected and assayed by ELISA to determine total IgG against each antigen, and the ‘tag-specific’ reactivity using an antigen containing either the MC2S domain or the foldon domain with a heterologous ectodomain (Fig 3A). For VXB-213, VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241, the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S for each group ranged between 3.7 and 11.2% (Fig 3B). In comparison, for the Arexvy RSVPreF3 antigen the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was around twice as high at 15.5 and 15.4%.

At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 both stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 5,272; 95%CI = 2,884–10,046 and geomean = 8,453; 95%CI = 4,966–14,894, respectively), which was approximately 6- and 10-fold higher relative to the dose-matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 817; 95%CI = 420–1,710). At the higher dose level of 3 µg of the RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 also stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 6,124; 95%CI = 4,375–8,690 and geomean = 7,534; 95%CI = 5,082–8,690, respectively), which was approximately 2- and 2.5-fold higher relative to the dose matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 2,958; 95%CI = 1,361–6,982). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-213 to the response elicited by the Arexvy antigen showed a significant difference at the 0.5 µg dose level (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.003) but not at the higher dose level of 3 µg (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.13). The equivalent analysis of neutralisation against hMPV preF (Strain CAN97–83) is shown in Fig 3D. At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of hMPV preF antigen, monovalent VXB-221 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (GM = 1,074; 95%CI = 818 - 1,426), however the neutralising immune response was approximately 5-fold lower for the bivalent VXB-241 (GM = 185; 95%CI = 98–380), potentially indicating some interference due to immunodominance of the RSV preF antigen. At the higher dose level of 3 µg of hMPV antigen, both monovalent VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (geomean = 721; 95%CI = 339 - 1,694 and geomean = 519; 95%CI = 235 - 1,288, respectively). Historically, broadly applicable platform technologies for vaccines have saved countless lives. Such platform technologies have included bacterial polysaccharide vaccines (Meningococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus) [42], chemical inactivation of viruses (polio, influenza, rabies, Hepatitis A) and viral attenuation (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Yellow Fever, Varicella) [43]. While successful, the application of these technologies to new targets often took upwards of 5- > 20 years. In recent years, a variety of platform technologies have been established that have significantly streamlined vaccine development and manufacturing. This is most clear in the mRNA vaccine revolution that has been brought forward in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. As there are still several challenges linked to the mRNA vaccines field (high reactogenicity, poor longevity, requirement for frozen storage) [44], having a broader variety of established vaccine platforms that are based on different approaches remains valuable. Here, we have demonstrated that vaccine antigens produced with the Molecular Clamp (MC) platform offer key advantages such as liquid stability and improved immune responses. The MC platform provides the versatility to target diverse viral pathogens. The MC platform is essentially a high stability trimerization domain, similar to previously utilised alternatives GCN4 and Foldon [45,46]. The broadly applicable potential of a first-generation Molecular Clamp based on the HIV-1 gp41 6HB domain was demonstrated in preclinical studies for several viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, and MERS coronavirus [30,31]. In 2020 a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine progressed through Phase 1 clinical trial, with demonstrated safety and good immunogenicity profiles, but was not progressed due to interference with some HIV diagnostic tests, generating false positives [29]. A re-engineered, non-HIV antigen based MC2S sequence, provides the same candidate vaccine attributes, but overcomes the hurdle that prevented progression of MC. The MC2S platform provides high production yield and purity with a universal purification system (AVI-8740 affinity resin), which facilitates rapid advancement through pre-clinical development. For two viral targets (RSV preF and hMPV preF) transient expression yields of 10 – 30 mg/L were achieved with purity above 95% by SDS-PAGE and approximately 90% homogenous trimer by SEC. This level of production comfortably accommodates pre-clinical testing, including in vitro assessment and animal immunisation studies. Furthermore, transition to 50L scale manufacture uses a comparable process regardless of antigen and was able to increase yields to >1 g/L. Production yields such as this with a consistent manufacturing process have the potential to dramatically reduce investment required to achieve commercial scale vaccine production. Following the approval of a first generation of RSV vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13], Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14,16], MRESVIA (Moderna) [15], a large unmet medical need remains with the combined burden of other severe respiratory tract infections amongst highly susceptible populations including newborns, children under 5 years of age, older adult elderly and the immunocompromised. Moreover, there are areas in which the currently approved RSV vaccines can be improved. The two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and the LNP/mRNA vaccine (MRESVIA) is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration [14]. All three current RSV vaccines must be discarded if not used within a defined short period of time. In comparison, our current data show that the MC2S incorporating RSV antigen VXB-213, as well as VXB221 (hMPV preF), are both stable in liquid form at 2–8 °C for > 12 months. This finding supports compatibility with prefilled syringes at 2–8°C. The approved RSV vaccines have been demonstrated to have good protective efficacy, which extends over seasons, however the dose level administered to achieve this protective efficacy is relatively high at 120 µg per dose. This is substantially higher than the 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain included in standard dose influenza vaccines, and higher even than the 60 µg HA per strain included in high dose formulations [47]. We have shown in a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study that VXB-213 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response than the Arexvy RSVpreF3 antigen at the lowest dose levels tested (p = 0.003), likely indicating better presentation of neutralising epitopes to naïve memory B-cells. This result is consistent with previous findings where a fully optimised RSV preF antigen which included the same pair of disulfide bridge stabilisations and optimal deletion within the furin cleavage site was shown to elicit strong neutralisating antibody responses relative to the original RSV preF DsCav1 antigen [33]. VXB-213 incorporates the same ectodomain modifications that are present in this optimised RSV preF antigen. A further complexity exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (for seasonal influenza virus, COVID-19 and RSV). hMPV is another high burden respiratory virus with a comparable incidence rate and severity to RSV in the older adult population [10]. The prospect of adding further vaccines into the annual schedule is a challenge and would likely impact coverage. We have focused on developing liquid stable antigens for both RSV and hMPV to be combined in a bivalent vaccine to reduce burden on healthcare providers and individuals. While there are currently no approved vaccines for hMPV, there have been a wealth of pre-fusion stabilised antigens produced based on the learnings from RSV [21–24]. We chose two of these, DSCavEs2 [21] and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23], to include as comparators for in vitro analysis. Consistent with expectations, prefusion specific nAbs were able to bind with similar affinity to VXB-221 and comparator antigens, while nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 but not the closed pre-fusion stabilised antigen v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C. DSCavEs2 was then included as a positive control within a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study. Here, VXB-221 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response relative to HMPV preF DSCavEs2 (p = 0.0003), however it should be noted that differences in purification methodologies used here and those used by Hseih et al., [22] may have contributed to this difference. The 2.5-fold improvement in elicited neutralising immune response was unexpected given that DSCavEs2 has been highly optimised for stability of the pre-fusion conformation. Monoclonal antibody avidity to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 also appeared to be relatively similar, except for neutralising mAb DS7 which recognises an epitope shared between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. A potential explanation for the improved neutralising immune response may relate to DSCavEs2 being optimised for efficient cleavage at the F1/F2 cleavage site [21], whereas VXB-221 is non-cleaved. It has previously been suggested that F1/F2 cleavage assists in the formation of a stable closed trimer, which was assumed, based on the earlier results for RSV preF would be the optimal antigen for stimulating a neutralizing immune response [23,24]. While nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound with similar affinity to both VXB-221 and DSCavEs2, accessibility to the trimer interface may be different in the context of vaccination. Alternatively, there may be additional neutralising epitopes that are specific to the non-cleaved hMPV preF. Of note, proteolytic cleavage of hMPV preF is inefficient relative to RSV preF [48,49], and timing of cleavage within the viral life cycle has not been well characterised. Contrary to structure-based antigen design focusing on the closed and/or fully cleaved hMPV preF which have included multiple structure stabilising mutations [21–24], VXB-221 is expected to adopt an open and non-cleaved preF conformation. This conformation allows for broad display of neutralising epitopes with minimal modification away from the native sequence. However, we note that monoclonal antibodies targeting the internal interface of the hMPV F protein exhibit varying levels of neutralizing potency. While some, such as M8C10 and MPV465, show modest neutralizing activity, others like MPV-458 demonstrate both high neutralizing potency and cross-reactivity across hMPV strains, highlighting the potential importance of this conserved epitope for vaccine design [28,50]. In mice that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine VXB-241, we observed some reduction in the neutralising immune response to both RSV and hMPV relative to the monovalent vaccines. This effect was particularly evident at the lowest dosage tested, where the neutralising response to hMPV was reduced by 5-fold; this was not seen for RSV. This finding is consistent with the immunodominance of RSV F relative to hMPV F, however it is unknown whether this same phenomenon will be observed in human clinical trials. As with the MC2S platform, approved RSV subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) both include a preF stabilising trimerisation domain [13,14]. The trimer stabilising domain present in Arexvy and Abrysvo RSV preF antigen, is the T4 fibritin sequence-foldon based and the same foldon is also included in RSV preF DSCav1 and hMPV preF DSCavEs2 antigens [21,32]. It has recently been reported that foldon can stimulate an ‘off-target response’ in human vaccine recipients that may negatively impact vaccine potency after repeated administrations [51]. It was recently demonstrated that further stabilisation of the RSV preF ectodomain can facilitate the omission of a trimerization domain thereby eliminating any off-target immune response from this domain [51]. We also recognized the importance of reducing the off-target immune response and achieved this through the incorporation of multiple N-linked glycosylation sites into MC2S. This strategy provides the benefit of easy purification process without drawback of off target response. For each naive mouse immunogenicity study, we calculated the fraction of vaccine elicited IgG that was directed to the T4 fibritin based-foldon or the MC2S trimer stabilising domain, by directly coating antigen to ELISA plates. It should however be noted that direct coating can cause antigen denaturation and so such results may underestimate antigen specific or domain specific IgG responses. Nevertheless we found that typically 10–30% of IgG elicited to foldon containing antigens was specific to the foldon sequence, and therefore unable to contribute to virus neutralisation. This was highly variable and sometimes constituted 40–50% of the elicited IgG response. In comparison, the fraction of IgG directed to the MC2S domain was typically below 10% of the elicited IgG response. Even when mice were immunised with the bivalent VXB-241, in which both antigens contained an identical MC2S domain (with different ectodomains), there was very little overall IgG directed to MC2S. In an ongoing clinical trial by Vicebio, we are exploring the comparative immune responses against the trimerisation domains of both the MC2S containing candidate antigens, and Arexvy as an active comparator (NCT0655614). In summary, the candidate vaccine antigens developed for RSV and hMPV using the second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp platform show high production yield, high liquid stability, and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway to assess safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). The molecular clamp platform technology contributes to the stabilisation of the antigens and offers the potential to advance the development of safe and effective vaccines for prevention of multiple medically important viral diseases. A subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 generated with the non-immunosilenced, MC2 sequence, recently completed Phase 1 trial testing (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05775887) further demonstrating the broad applicability of the proprietary platform. The high yield and consistent production process of MC2S containing candidate vaccine antigens together with the focus on creating liquid stable, multivalent formulations, has the potential to maximise global distribution, improve vaccine compliance, and protect vulnerable populations from medically important respiratory viral diseases. All animal work related to this study was performed in accordance with policies for the proper use and care of animals set by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (AEC numbers: 2021/AE000123, 2021/AE000183, 2021/AE000571, 2023/AE000539). Experiments were designed to minimise animal numbers, and all animals were housed in suitable facilities with ad libitum access to food, water and environmental enrichment. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia by isoflurane inhalation by properly trained personnel. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation. Vaccine antigen coding sequences codon optimised for Cricetulus griseus and synthetic DNA was synthesised in vitro as gblocks (IDT). Antigen coding sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vector pXC-17.4 (Lonza Group, Basel Switzerland) by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stellar Competent Cells (Takara Bio) and screened for correct insertions by colony PCR. Plasmids from selected colonies were isolated and DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence fidelity. Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO-S culture (ThermoFisher) using manufacturer’s instructions. RSV and hMPV antigens were purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using either an affinity column coupled with monoclonal antibody 101F [52] or resin specific to the clamp domain (AVI8740, Avitide, Repligen). Additional antigens were purified by affinity chromatography with either MC (HIV-1 gp41) specific antibody, HIV1281 [53], SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody CR3022 [54], Nipah F virus specific antibody mab66 [55], or influenza H1 virus specific antibody 5J8 [56]. Immunoaffinity columns were prepared by chemical coupling of mAbs to NHS-Activated Sepharose Resing (Cytiva) using manufacturer’s instructions. Antigens were purified using high pH elution from immunoaffinity resin as previously described [30,31]. Affinity purification of MC2S containing antigens was conducted by pre-equilibrating resin with 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 50mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and eluted in 50mM Tris, 1M MgCl2, pH7.4, before then being buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4. Homogeneity of purified proteins was analysed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. Panels of antibodies specific to RSV and MPV F proteins were generated by cloning the antibody variable domains into mab-xpress vectors by previously described methods [57]. The genetic constructs were expressed in CHO-S mammalian culture and purified using a MabSelect Sure affinity column (Cytiva). The variable domain sequences for 101F [52], D25 [36], MPE8 [37], AM14 [38], DS7 [39], MPV458, MPV483, MPV467, MPV487 [40], M8C10 [25], CR3022 [54], mab66 [55], and 5J8 [56] were obtained from public databases. Purified proteins were characterised by standard ELISA using a panel of mAbs described above. Briefly, for RSV antigens ELISA 96-well Maxisorp plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 2 µg/mL of mouse isotype Motavizumab (ref). Plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk diluent (KPL, SeraCare)). Commercially acquired Arexvy (GSK) or Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens were resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and gently mixed to dissolve. Antigens were added to plates coated with capture antibody at 2 µg/mL in blocking buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T, these plates were then probed with a serial dilution of the stated monoclonal antibody, starting at 33.33 nM and serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. After incubating for another hour at 37°C plates were washed as above and bound mAb was detected using goat anti human HRP (ThermoFisher) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. TMB substrate was added and incubated at RT for 3 minutes 30 seconds before the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances were then read at 450 nm. Background absorbances of the full reaction without primary mAb were averaged and subtracted from the respective test absorbance readings. Antigen oligomerisation profiles in solution were assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL resin filtration column (Cytiva). Antigens (40 ug) were applied using a 500 ul sample loop. 50L batches of VXB-213 and VXB-221 were produced using each of the CHO K1 clonal cell lines to produce material for use in a human Phase 1 clinical trial. Briefly, cells were expanded in shake flasks and then a Rocking Motion Bioreactor (Sartorius), before inoculation into 50L HyPerforma Single-Use Bioreactors (ThermoScientific). Production batches were maintained for 14 days with an optimised feed strategy and standard monitoring for growth rate, viable cell density, pH, osmolarity, glucose level, lactate level, ammonia level and carbon dioxide level After the 14-day production run, cell culture supernatant was harvested by two-stage depth filtration and purified by AVI-8740 resin affinity capture, two ion exchange/mix mode column purification steps, viral inactivation with TNBP/PS80, viral nanofiltration and tangential flow filtration (TFF) into the final formulation buffer. Mouse immunisation studies were conducted using female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks of age, housed at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) Animal Facility in the University of Queensland, Australia. Mice were immunised with 0.5 µg, 2 µg or 3 µg per recombinant protein antigen stated (maximum dose 6 µg for bivalent group) with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). Immediately prior to mouse vaccination, the Arexvy antigen vial was resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and then mixed with AddaVax (InvivoGen). Each group (n = 8) was bled via the caudal vein 1 day prior to receiving the first dose (day -1). They were then immunised IM on day 0 and again on day 21 (3 weeks). On day 42 (6 weeks), animals were euthanised and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. The blood was allowed to coagulate overnight at 4°C before centrifugation to isolate the serum. Serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes for use in immunological assays. Mouse IgG titres were determined by standard ELISA as described above with the following deviations. Antigens were coated directly on the ELISA plates at 2 µg/mL and probed with a 1/20 initial dilution of mouse serum that was serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. Following incubation and washing, the bound serum was detected using goat anti mouse HRP (ThermoFisher) at 1:2,000 dilution, before detection and reading as stated above. To determine the total IgG, the serum was tested against the vaccine antigens. To identify ‘tag-specific’ reactivity (i.e., reactivity to either the MC2S domain or foldon domain), the serum was assayed against a Nipah F containing the respective tag. RSV A2 and MPV-GFP1 virus (strain CAN97–83) were propagated on Vero cells and stocks prepared were stored at -80°C. Viral titres were determined using plaque assay [58]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 5 × 104 cells/well in Opti-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After overnight growth to allow a confluent monolayer, serial dilutions of virus stock were prepared in Serum-free Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-Trypsin and 1X Glutamax in the case of MPV. Cell monolayers were inoculated with 50μL of virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After 1 hour incubation, in the case of RSV, the inoculum was topped up with overlay medium (Medium 199 with 1.5% methylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and in the case of MPV, the viral inoculum was removed before topping up with 1.5% CMC media. The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, overlay medium was removed, the cells were fixed (80% acetone) and plaques were immunostained with either RSV specific human IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific human IgG MPV483. The primary antibody staining was followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-human IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2,500). Plaques were read using an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) and titre was recorded as PFU/mL. PRNT assays were performed as previously described [58]. Briefly, mouse sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted 1:10–1:21870. Equal volumes of viral suspension made in inoculum media by addition of virus stock to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL were added to the serum dilution to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:20–1:43,740 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for the virus to be neutralised by serum antibodies. The inoculum media used for RSV was Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while the media used for hMPV was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK and 1X Glutamax. The residual viral infectivity in the sera/virus mixture was assayed by adding the mixture in duplicated to Vero cells monolayer cultivated in 96-well flat bottom plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for virus adsorption to take place. This was directly followed by addition of overlay media in the case of RSV while the viral inoculum was removed before adding 1.5% CMC media in the case of hMPV. The plates were further incubated for 72 hours before fixing the cells with 80% acetone and plaque visualisation by immunostaining as above. PRNT assays for SARS-CoV-2 strain 614G and Influenza virus H1N1pdm A/California09 were conducted with similar methodologies as previously described [31,59]. Nipah virus neutralisation titre was assessed by lentivirus-based pseudo particle assay, as per a method previously described [60]. Human plasma depletion PRNT assays were performed as above. In the case of RSV, human plasma was serially diluted then first incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour either alone or with RSV Fsol, DSCav1 or VXB-213 diluted to 0.5 µg/mL. RSV A2 was then added to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL and again incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixture of virus, human plasma and depletion antigen was then added directly to cells and the PRNT assay performed as above. In the case of hMPV, the presence of antigen within the human plasma depletion PRNT assay had a non-desirable effect of directly blocking viral entry, presumably by receptor binding. Instead, 1.4 mg of VXB-221 or DsCavEs2 were each coupled to 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin (Cytiva), as per manufacturer’s instructions. A control 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin was produced with coupling buffer alone in parallel. The three Sepharose resins (control, VXB-221 and DSCavEs2) were inactivated and washed as per manufacturer’s instructions and then equilibrated with PBS. 1 mL of heat inactivated (HI) human plasma was added to each Sepharose resin and incubated on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature. Antigen depleted and control depleted human plasma were then collected into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and passed through a 0.22 µM filter syringe to ensure sterility and removal of Sepharose beads. Antigen depleted and mock depleted human plasma were then used directly in the hMPV PRNT assay as per mouse sera. Plaque visualisation for human plasma depletion PRNT was completed as above, however with RSV specific mouse IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific mouse IgG MPV483 followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2500).

Title: Wall Street’s AI Bubble Is Worse Than the 1999 Dot-com Bubble, Warns a Top Economist

Back in 1999, Wall Street lost its collective mind over the internet. Companies with no revenue were suddenly worth billions, “eyeballs” were treated as currency, and market analysts predicted a frictionless future where everything would be digital. Then the bubble burst. Between March 2000 and October 2002, an estimated five trillion dollars in market value vanished into thin air. Today, it is happening again. This time, the magic word is not â.com.â It is âAI.â According to Torsten Slok, the influential chief economist at Apollo Global Management, a major global investment firm, the current AI driven market bubble is even more stretched than the dot com frenzy of the late 1990s. And he has the data to prove it. âThe difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,â Slok wrote in a recent research note that was widely shared across social media and financial circles. The chart from Apollo compares the 12 month forward price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. In plain English, a P/E ratio measures how expensive a stock is by comparing its price to its profits. A high P/E ratio means investors are paying a premium and are betting on strong future growth. Slok’s chart reveals something stunning: in 2025, the P/E ratios of the top ten companies are even higher than they were at the absolute peak of the dot com bubble in 2000. Torsten Slok: "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s" pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 16, 2025 This means investors are betting so aggressively on AI giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Google that their stock prices have become detached from their actual earnings, even more so than tech darlings like Cisco and AOL were in the nineties. The top 10 companies driving this frenzy, which hold the most significant market value on Wall Street, include tech titans like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta. It is a super concentrated AI frenzy that is pushing a handful of mega cap stocks into nosebleed territory. You have probably heard that the S&P 500 is performing well this year. Here is the uncomfortable truth: most of those gains are coming from just those ten companies. The other 490 companies in the index are barely moving. This kind of narrow rally is incredibly risky. It means the health of the entire stock market is dependent on the performance of a very small number of firms. If Nvidia sneezes, the entire market could catch a cold. The problem is that Wall Street is treating AI as if it has already fulfilled every promise, from a productivity revolution to trillion dollar cost savings. The potential is being priced as a certainty, even though most of those gains have not yet materialized. In 1999, the internet was real. It did change everything. But that fact did not stop investors from wildly overpaying for companies that could not deliver on the hype. The parallels with todayâs AI excitement are chilling. Every corporate earnings call now dutifully mentions an “AI strategy,” just like every company in 1999 slapped on a â.comâ to its name. Stocks are surging on the vague potential of AI, not necessarily on real, current revenue. Wall Street is pricing in a perfect AI future without acknowledging the enormous risks: regulatory crackdowns, staggering compute costs, model hallucinations, or simply a slower than expected adoption rate. As Slokâs chart shows, the market is pricing these top ten AI heavy firms as if they are invincible. That is never a good sign. This is not a question of whether AI will change the world. It will, just as the internet did. The real question is how much investors are willing to pay today for profits that might not arrive for years, if ever. If history teaches us anything, it is that bubbles do not pop because the technology is fake. They pop when investor expectations dramatically outpace reality and the flow of easy money dries up. The more Wall Street bets on AI perfection, the more fragile this market rally becomes. If corporate earnings do not catch up to these sky high valuations, and soon, the market may not even need a specific trigger to deflate. The valuations alone could do the job. And when bubbles pop, they do not do so politely. They implode, wiping out trillions in value and shattering investor trust in the process. The technology called AI will certainly survive. The top ten companies likely will too. But the portfolios chasing this dream without a parachute might not. Just like in 2000, when it seemed the internet had made financial gravity obsolete, the AI hype train is speeding toward a cliff it thinks it can fly over.

Title: Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi took us inside his $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, which closes today

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?” With tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.” The tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.) His advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.” And it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com 150 more countries will get tariffs of 10%-15% President Trump said letters would be sent to each government informing them of the “deals” they would receive. He also said he was “indifferent” to negotiating further with Europe. Trump claims he has changed the formula for Coca-Cola The president said the company had agreed to use cane sugar in its recipe moving forward instead of corn syrup. The company did not immediately confirm the change. JPMorgan plans data fee that could hit crypto JPMorgan’s plans to charge fees for access to customer account data could make it economically impossible for many consumers to use stablecoins and crypto, according to three industry executives, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation. “This would cripple the crypto industry,” one of the execs said. How Carney approaches Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has a remarkable way of keeping President Donald Trump calm and collaborative—so much so that he’s been dubbed the “Trump whisperer.” Here’s how he does it. Markets fluctuate on Powell moves Meanwhile, President Trump maintained on Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell despite reports this week of a letter Trump had drafted to do so. Markets dropped earlier in the day, but finished slightly higher on Wednesday than where they started. HPE reaches deal with Elliott Management Hewlett Packard Enterprise will give activist investor Elliott Management as many as two board seats as part of a new agreement following the latter’s criticism of the struggling company. The pressure on HPE CEO Antonio Neri won’t stop, however, and he could still lose his job. That Epstein thing won’t go away In a long post on Truth Social, the president insisted that anyone calling for the release of further information held by the government regarding Jeffrey Epstein was participating in a “hoax.” He said he wanted a decisive break with his own supporters who continue to push for more transparency around what the Department of Justice knows about the late billionaire financier and how he gathered his fortune: “I don’t want their support anymore!” Context: Epstein claimed he and Trump were friends for many years. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.32% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.7% in early trading. China’s CSI 300 Index was up 0.68% this morning. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in early trading. Bitcoin is holding on at the $118K level. Macquarie on the “fiscal capture” of tariffs: “Traders are staying complacent in the face of the new ('August 1') US import tariffs; they may reason that Pres. Trump doesn't want to preside over another market crash. But there's also the more ominous possibility that Trump has "moved on" from using tariffs to extract concessions, and is now using tariffs to boost tariff revenues. If that's the case, August 1 may see a flood of new higher tariffs, as well as retaliation. This "fiscal capture" of tariff policy shouldn't seem peculiar. After all, there are a myriad of reports that Trump's desire to replace the Fed's Chair also comes from a need to "fiscally capture" monetary policy, thus reducing the federal government's interest burden should debt levels rise,” per Thierry Wizman. Wedbush on woes at ASML: “View: ASML's preliminary remarks highlighted the impact geopolitical tensions and threatened US tariffs are having on future business prospects. While ASML's bookings (~25% ahead of prior expectations) seemingly point to solid near-term conditions; management pointed to a lack of clarity around future results given the potential impact of policy decisions. ASML management noted for instance a 30% tariff on European goods could for instance lift the price of an EUV tool from €250 to €325). As such, management suggested they could not at this juncture confidently forecast revenue growth in 2026 (a result that in turn is weighing heavily on the stock this AM),” per Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault. Wedbush on Q2 tech earnings preview: “In our view the Street is underestimating the underlying AI driven growth ahead and we expect a very strong 2Q tech earnings season over the coming weeks that further validates our bullish thesis led by Big Tech stalwarts … Our top 5 Wedbush tech picks for the second half of the year are Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Palantir, and Tesla,” per Daniel Ives et al.

Shareholders of tech and social media giant Meta, have sued for more than $8 billion in in fines and legal reimbursements, in relation to an alleged privacy scandal at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, as per reports. The action is based on relevations that data of millions of Facebook users was accessed by now defunct political consultant Cambridge Analytica, and alleges that around 11 executives — including Mark Zuckerberg himself and former Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg — indulged in insider trading and used the company to conduct illegal data harvesting, while the board failed to oversee the social media giant's operations. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Spokespeople for Meta did not immediately respond to queries, Bloomberg and Reuters said. The report said that the Meta shareholders, comprised largely of union pension funds, alleged that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg “ran the company as an illegal data harvesting operation”, while the board “completely ignored their duty to oversee the company”. The claimants want reimbursement of over $8 billion in fines and legal costs from executives to Meta, which was paid to settle the 2012 privacy agreement violation to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trail in the Facebook ‘privacy scandal’ began at a Delaware court on July 16 (Wednesday), and is scheduled to last until July 25 (next Friday), according to a Reuters report. Notably, the case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J McCormick — the judge who rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package, as per a Bloomberg report. Among the defendants in the case are, venture capitalist and current board member Marc Andreessen; and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The suit alleges: Notably, after the insider-trading claims, Zuckerberg moved to seal his stock-trading strategies from public revelation during the trial, claiming that it is highly confidential information. Mark Zuckerberg controls about 61 per cent of the Meta board’s voting power through a dual-class share structure, effectively granting him sole control over the board composition and corporate strategy — past, present and future, the BB report noted.

Title: Corporate turnaround artist Jim Lanzone is “sticking to what users need” as CEO of Yahoo

On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, cohosts Diane Brady, executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media, and editorial director Kristin Stoller talk to Jim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo. They talk about the company’s nostalgia aspect, where it fits in a new era of search and AI, and keeping Yahoo a “guide to the World Wide Web.” Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Jim Lanzone: But if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet, I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Diane Brady: Good luck with that. Brady: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Leadership Next. The podcast about the people… Kristin Stoller: …and trends… Brady: …that are shaping the future of business. I’m Diane Brady. Stoller: And I’m Kristin Stoller. Brady: Yahoo, that’s what we’re talking about. I say “Ya-hoo” because I’m Canadian. Stoller: It’s your accent, and I love how you say it. But I, as a ’90s kid, say Yahoo. Brady: Yeah, and I say pasta. So it’s Yahoo and it’s Jim Lanzone, and he is the new CEO of a brand that is kind of hard to figure out. Tech, search, it’s media. It has been a cautionary tale. Is it a turnaround tale? What do you think? Stoller: I just want to bring us back for a second, to the golden age of Yahoo. Founded in 1994, think back, Diane—what were you doing then? And did you have a Yahoo email address? Or what was your email provider? Brady: I had just graduated. I was living in Asia. I remember my first email had many numbers in it, so I don’t think it was Yahoo. And look, I remember my first real encounter was when I came to the States, and I remember the arguments over whether we had to put the exclamation point, because they had an exclamation point in their name. And it used to honestly annoy me. It felt a bit sort of hubristic but yet it was the big beast in town. Stoller: See for me, all the cool kids at school had Yahoo and AOL. I was stuck with CompuServe because I think my dad got it for free. Yeah, I hated it. But okay, so now we’ve moved past—and although I don’t want to say move past, because they still have people with Yahoo email addresses, it’s still the number-two email I would assume, after Google or Gmail. Brady: A long number two. It has 3 billion hits a month, which makes you wonder about that intersection of influence—do eyeballs and influence still mean the same thing? And look, he’s an interesting guy. He’s an entrepreneur. He was at Tinder. He’s basically been a turnaround artist. He’s been there four years. And so what do you think? How much is Yahoo on your radar screen these days? Stoller: It’s really not. But I will say that I have two friends who work at Yahoo Finance and Yahoo News, and they love it and tell me they do really good work over there. Other than the journalism part of it, and I use Yahoo Finance to check stocks. I use it for stuff like that. I don’t use it for search. I don’t use it for anything else. And it was kind of a brand that I had thought, you know, had its heyday back in the early 2000s and they had so many missed opportunities. They lost the chance to buy Facebook, they missed out on a bunch of other deals. And I just thought they were kind of stagnant. Brady: But it lives to see a new day and like you, I’m very fond of the media properties, top notch journalists that they hire, I have to say. And look, I look forward to hearing what his vision is. You know, again, it’s, it’s past its 30th anniversary. As you pointed out, it’s still here, much like Ask Jeeves, which he also worked at. Stoller: Yes, he was the CEO of that pre-Google, pre-ChatGPT. Brady: So how do you turn around a legacy brand that has become a case study in failure. What does success look like? And it still has incredible traffic. So the bones, as he would say, are probably pretty good. Yeah, lots to talk about. Stoller: We’ll be back with Jim after the break. Brady: We’re entering an era of innovation unlike any we’ve witnessed before. You all see it: The pace of technological change is staggering, and it’s challenging for any leader to keep up. We spoke with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, which is the longtime sponsor of this podcast. Here’s his advice for leaders on how to navigate this new world. Jason Girzadas: There’s probably nothing more important for CEOs, no matter what organization they’re leading, to really be thinking about technology’s impact on our workforce. It’s really a function of, how do you think about technology in concert with your workforce? We at Deloitte talk about it as the age of width, the age of technology with your workforce, and really embracing this idea of the codependency of technology and workforce. We’re also an environment of a very tight workforce where there’s a scarcity of top talent. That’s going to be the challenge for organizations, to demonstrate to top talent that they can grow and evolve the work that they do, working with leading technology in a very aligned way. Finally, it’s what top talent really wants in an organization, is to learn and grow and to be part of an organization that’s supportive of them actually embedding technology in their work. Brady: Jim, I think the first thing that would be good is define Yahoo as it is now, because obviously, it’s, you know, media, it’s been search, it’s email, it’s so many different—it’s a tech company. I mean, how do you define it in your mind? Lanzone: It’s funny, and I’ve said this a couple times, but historically speaking, they would ask that question of the Yahoo CEO onstage at conferences. Brady: Oh, well, here we are asking. Lanzone: It’s a bit of a gotcha. So it’s a great first question. But because, you know, again, I think all the different ups and downs in the company and along the way as a public company, which there’s a lot of different pressure that came along with that, had to try to figure out what its way was going to be as the internet was evolving. And I can go into it, but our team picked it up after that, so we didn’t have all those pressures. You can step back and look at it when we picked it up, and understand, first of all, it’s a conglomerate of a lot of different products. Some of those products have media or or use media as a feature. Some are utilities, right, like search or email. Even within some products. So let’s take sports where we definitely have media. We have the number one NBA podcast, we have the number one combat sports podcast, we have the number one newsletter. But the spine of the book for sports is fantasy sports. You know, where we’re the OGs, you know, sports scores and things like that. And those are more products. So I think at the end of the day, Yahoo is a product company, and I can go all into product… Brady: …a product conglomerate. A conglomerate of different products. Lanzone: But that is common these days. If you think about Meta, right? You have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have WhatsApp, you have Oculus. Now, you have AI. Even Google, with anything from Android to Waze to Android to YouTube. Amazon, obviously, same thing. All of the major internet companies, and Yahoo, after all this time, is still a top five internet company in the US and globally. We get there as a combination of brands, but Yahoo—and my team, we had to figure this out when we got here, you know, after all this time. We just had our 30th anniversary this year, you know. Brady: And you’re approaching your fourth. Lanzone: Yeah, I started [at the] end of September of 2021, right after Apollo bought the company. But you know, what’s our reason for being? Like, why does Yahoo exist, and why has it been so successful through all the ups and downs? Why is it still so large and used? And you know, the answer to that was one answer, which is in all the categories where we were still at the top. So we’re number one in finance, number two in news, really number two in sports. Brady: Doesn’t sound like much of a gotcha question, then. Lanzone: Well, all of these categories where we were still at the top is—we were still fulfilling the founder’s original mission of the company, like back in 1995, which was to be the trusted guide, you know, through the Wild West of the internet. It’s just that that job changed between 1995 when you were just trying to find websites to get things done, all the way through to now, where you’re deploying things like AI to help people get things done, right? So how you do it changes, but what we do, being the trusted guide to the internet, doesn’t change. Stoller: So I’m a kid of the ’90s, born almost around the time Yahoo was founded. So I remember it very vividly. I remember—also, I think it’s funny that this is very full circle for you, coming initially from Ask Jeeves, you were the CEO of that, and now coming back to an internet company, which is very full circle. So you’re right. I think Yahoo has gone through a bunch of ups, a bunch of downs, totally different than what it was in 1994. But I think that, you know, in the mid-2000s people were really worried about this company. And so when people came to you and said, “Hey, Jim, do you want to take this job?” What made you say, Yes, I will. I will do it in this uncertainty.” Brady: Jim, I like a challenge lens. Lanzone: Yeah. Well, I always wanted a crack at this. I knew every previous regime of this company, a lot of friends and colleagues who went through here…. Brady: …should we rate them all? Lanzone: No, I mean all the different teams, like, you know, Jimmy Pitaro and Jeff Weiner and Brad Garlinghouse. You know, just the really original teams. You know, even the first team, because I really had two things… Brady: …Jerry Yang? Lanzone: Jerry Yang, who’s still involved with the company. I just had him back for an all-hands meeting. He was amazing, yeah, for the 30th. He’s an investor in the new version of the company after we spun out of Verizon. It’s really a new corporation. So it, yeah, and he invested in it. So it’s amazing. But no, I had done two startups in the ’90s, or was involved with two early-stage companies in the ’90s. So that led me to Ask Jeeves, that was my first turnaround, and I learned the hard way, like, why were we able to do that? And we, you know, I think we almost 50x the stock from where we picked it up at the crash, in 2001 to the peak of where we got to before we sold to IAC. And we had a lot of traffic, but we had a product that had seen better days, and a brand that had been through the ringer, and a team that had been also through it because it was the first crash. So you had to rebuild all that. And once you got the basics right and you got the team rebuilt, and you were actually executing on your basic value proposition, you know, then you could innovate. And we innovated our tails off in that time period, 2003 to 2007. We were, you know, we were the ones who innovated, who really created the [inaudible] approach to search. That was what we were known for. We were the first major partner of Google when they started to syndicate AdWords, and that really made us profitable. Stoller: …and I used Jeeves like the OG ChatGPT, I would ask it so many questions. Brady: I want to bring us up to 2025, I mean, like, but let me ask, because I do—think you mentioned turnarounds, and Ask Jeeves is just one of the many you’ve done. And what was it, to Kristin’s point, that you saw as the opportunity with Yahoo? Because we’ve just heard a litany, and it’s all very correct as to where you’re number one. Obviously, it’s also been a case study in what not to do. What did you see as the runway that you could create? Lanzone: Well, remember that the—let’s say, the case study in what not to do, it was very interesting… Brady: …don’t turn down Google. Lanzone: Well, if you go do the forensics, which I did, if you are in the late 1990s early 2000s, search doesn’t have a business model yet, and you are the trusted guide to the internet, and there’s been a market crash and everything, outsourcing search to Google, and before that, they did [inaudible] me for the best price possible, which included a link to Google with their logo on the page that when you got there was only a search box, which is how 91% of internet sessions started at the time. That was like a good deal, just so happens that, you know, it really ceded search to Google, and I think the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out what it should be, and it went into media, and it tried to look at social, and it took another crack at search, and I mean, all kinds of things as a public company. It then eventually sold to Verizon in the mid-2010s. And so when we got it, it was after all that. So we had the luxury of not being public, but those basic ingredients were there, which was a huge audience, huge and very important categories. And so both Apollo, who bought the company, and then brought me in as CEO, and me, we, you know, I talked to them before they bought the company. Our thesis was, if you could get that asset at the right price, and it was around $5 billion and if you look around everybody in the top 10 Comscore internet companies, they’re all trillion-dollar companies. You could work with that. And so I, you know, again, I could go through it, but we set about the turnaround process using those raw ingredients, and that’s where we are today. Stoller: What was the hardest decision you had to make when you took over? Was it cutting, restructuring, betting on a new product? What was really difficult for you? Lanzone: Well, you knew all that coming in. You knew that there was gonna have to be some turnover on the team. You also, and this has been true every time I come into a new company, you also find a lot of talent and can redeploy them in new ways. So step one is always rebuilding the team, getting great people involved. You know, as a CEO, especially if something is big, you can’t do everything and so that always is step one, and, and so yeah, from there, there are certain products that, you know, like search or email that are huge and things you need to invest in to get back on track. And, and then ones where, you know, in the case of email, it hadn’t really been upgraded. And I mean, literally over a decade at those levels. And so when you start putting those things in place, you can start to get early returns. The hardest decision was probably how early on we had to essentially renovate our ad tech group, which was something that both AOL and Yahoo had spent many years acquiring a lot of companies, 30-plus companies. Brady: What do you mean renovate? How does one renovate an ad tech group? Lanzone: Well, we had to make some really hard decisions about what we’re going to invest in and where we didn’t have a right to win. And so we were doing a lot of things, a lot of different businesses. We had a native advertising business, we had a supply-side platform. And we shut those down. In some cases, we outsourced those to others, and then we decided, well, where we can win is our DSP, our demand-side platform, so we’re going to invest there. So that decision, my second year there, or, you know, actually made the decision before my first anniversary, required, you know, having a lot of people leave the company and doing deals to outsource things that we had been building for years. But that decision saved hundreds of millions of dollars a year on the cost side, but really strategically, let us refocus on put something that could really be a big asset creation opportunity, which is our DSP, where we are now the world’s largest private DSP, competing with trade desk, Google, Google’s version of that, Amazon’s version of that. And, you know, I think we’re still early days now and innovating in that space. Brady: I want to talk about what’s ahead. But one of the things I like about your career, Jim, is the eclectic nature of it. And I know I’ve, I’ve had an eclectic career myself. One of the benefits is you get to work with all kinds of cool people. And I think of your career, you’ve got Les Moonves, you’ve got Barry Diller. You mentioned Jerry Yang. I mean, there’s so many different people. I’m curious who stands out for you as either a mentor or just somebody—I mean, these are personalities. I’ve met them myself, and how has that influenced you? And when you look back, who do you think of fondly, or maybe not so fondly? I mean, we’re open to both here. Stoller: Yeah, give us all the dirt, Jim. Lanzone: When you’ve been around doing this this long, and again, I’ve done consumer internet now for basically 28 years, and have had those different times. I can bore you with how many of those are influential on me. Brady: No, go ahead. I want to hear. Stoller: Name-drop, feel free. Lanzone: When I left Barry and [unintelligible] I did a startup from scratch. And Bill Gurley, who wrote for Fortune for many years, and Jeff Yang were my two main investors. And the idea for that came from another big mentor of mine, Dave Goldberg, who was a very close friend, but also a huge mentor, we came up… Brady: Yeah, I knew Dave. SurveyMonkey. Lanzone: Well, he did SurveyMonkey when I went to do Clicker, but the whiteboard was in his EIR office, a benchmark of doing the future of video search and and then Blake Krikorian, another very close friend who passed away a year later, who was the founder of Slingbox, was also on the board of that startup, and was a huge friend, but also a huge mentor, you know, of mine. Yeah, you learn different things from all of them along the way, and, and obviously, with Barry, you know, I remember, we were in the back of a car, and I’ve always been fascinated by, well, by media, but also by, like, the history of things. And so I would always pepper him, like, how did you greenlight Airplane? And I get the story about he and Michael Eisner, you know, had offices next to each other, and he heard laughs coming out. And you know, they both had been reading the script. And he says, but before that was The Kentucky Fried Movie. And I mean, you just hear this history of how they do these things. And I remember him saying to me, you know, this is in the back of the car in like, 2007, I wonder if we started today, if we would have been as successful. And obviously, 18 years later,the answer is, of course. Barry Diller is one of the world’s best entrepreneurs, it turns out, you know, over the last 30 years. But his way of drilling into the core idea of things. Always, I remember him saying, there’s always another way around the mountain. And I always say that to my team, if we get stuck on something, Brady: You know, he told me once, the hardest thing to hire for is curiosity, which always stuck with me, because he’s right, and you’re very curiosity-driven. That’s the way you talk to people, isn’t it? You mentioned, you just go and you try to get to know them. Lanzone: Well, that’s part of his drilling down on, on the core idea, you know, and not just going just off the data, which, again, is also very important. I’m a product person at heart, you know, if I take a new job, drilling into the data is probably the first thing I do. But between him, less, where, you know who ran, obviously, that company very successfully as a public company. But what was also the number one? Brady: This is when you were at CBS Interactive? Lanzone: At CBS Interactive, and knowing that it also was about gut and the core idea, and I’ve other friends, like Tony Fadell, who helped… Brady: …with Nest… Lanzone: … with Nest but also created the iPod and helped create the iPhone. And there’s a lot of it that is the art side too. And I really believe in the right-brain side of this, the taste side of this. And in the early stages of a turnaround, you can’t always show that side, but then you always get to the point, right? At CBS, the initial challenge was they had bought CNET, which was a struggling public company, and it needed to be turned around first. The reward for that was we created CBS All Access, which was one of the first streaming platforms, and we launched that in 2014, five years before HBO Max and Disney+ and that was at the end of the day, a gut decision. We got criticized when we launched that, that it wasn’t going to work, and how dare one network have its own streaming service? So, yeah, I’ve learned that both of those are very important. Stoller: For us, I feel like, or at least for me, and maybe you, Diane, when I think Yahoo, I immediately think media. And I think it’s just, you know, we’re journalists. We have all these… Brady: Not email? My sister still has her Yahoo email account. Stoller: Yeah, as I told you earlier, I was a CompuServe girl then an AOL, so sorry, Jim. Lanzone: Still have all of those URLs. Stoller: Yeah, exactly. But I’m wondering about, you know, from a non-journalist perspective, how do you kind of view the media industry at Yahoo and just in general, how are you looking at what’s next for your journalists? Lanzone: Yeah, well, part of what we figured out when we got here was, again, you do the forensics on the company. What makes it successful. The history of why Yahoo even got into media at all was not by being investigative journalists or on the enterprising side of news, but by being the first and best aggregator of news and being a partner to people like Fortune, by sending them traffic, sharing the revenue. It’s funny to see AI companies now trying to ink those deals. We have 1000s of those deals that go back 20+ years with companies. We still operate that way today. If you go to our page, we are sending traffic to Business Insider who would have, you know, those stories and help them be successful. We then, you know, accentuate that with our own journalists who are providing context to that. Whether it’s sports or Brian and Julie and team in finance, that really is where Yahoo is strong, and how we do journalism. And over the last three years, as we figure out what’s our role in that ecosystem, I think our role is to be the trusted guide, to be purple, to be neutral, and to help our users wherever they may fall on any spectrum, get to the content that they’re looking for and be partners with people. Brady: Asset-light. It sounds like an asset-light strategy. If I look at the humans as assets, does that position you well, for the next generation of where we go with media? Lanzone: Well, we do—look, we also have a lot of humans… Brady: …we know several… Stoller: …yeah, I know two of them! Lanzone: If you come up to our studio, uptown, we have an amazing studio, and, you know, by the end of this year we’ll be doing 50 hours a week of original programming just in sports. So we also are producing media, but again, I would say, in service of helping our users accomplish their goals. And that is a little bit different, right? Because in finance, they’re trying to make money or save money. In sports, they are trying to beat the snot out of their friends in fantasy, or they’re trying to be a smarter fan about their team that they’re following. It always is in service of something that our users are trying to get done. And so I would just say our role in the ecosystem of media is, I think it’s very important, because we have a huge amount of traffic, and we send a huge amount of traffic, and we’re very thoughtful about how we do that and what that product needs to look like, and how we partner to keep it a very healthy media ecosystem. We’re big believers in that. If we violate trust with our users, and I would say over time, that is something that you know, probably as the different variations of Yahoo and different owners of Yahoo, it probably wavered a bit, but we knew that is the first thing. Like, we have to be the trusted source for people, and that means we also have to have trusted partners. Like, we can’t be sending people to click bait or to attention vampires who are just trying to get you. We got to send them to the highest quality content. Stoller: It seems like you have competitors in a bunch of different spaces. You have, like Google, dare I say, you have other media competitors like Fortune. Brady: And AI. I keep waiting for the deepfake news call, right? Stoller: Yeah. I think you know, what they’re going to do to search is wild. Who do you view as, like, your biggest competitors? And how are you fighting back? Lanzone: Well when we did the original Google deal in 2002, Eric Schmidt, people said, “How could you do that?” I mean, we were the fourth-ranked search engine. We survived everybody else. Stoller: So people were questioning it back then? Lanzone: Oh yeah, how could you do that? And Eric had the term “co-opetition,” and… Brady: …as he would… Lanzone: …but we were public and they weren’t. So we were almost their tracking stock for the first couple of years, and so, yeah, I mean, we helped each other on that front, and maybe we competed for users. But from our standpoint, we always had to have a unique reason for being relative to them. That’s true of anything that I’ve ever run. You know, CBS products, Yahoo products, I mean, they all have to be unique. So that’s how I think about it. If you talk to my team, though, you would hear every single one of our team say the same thing, which is we really don’t get distracted by competition. You have to keep tabs, obviously, on the way the ecosystem is changing. When I took this job in September ’21 it was still 14 months before ChatGPT launched. That changed the world. That created opportunities and threats for us. I think they’re more market driven then, instead of individual companies and products necessarily. And we think about taking over Yahoo, we have so much to do that I really think we’re competing against ourselves more than we are anybody else, at least for now. We’ve just so many things, if we get those right, that we will keep growing. We are growing a really healthy clip again now, and so that’s really what I focus on. Brady: So let’s talk about that a little bit. And I want to unpack your background a bit more too. But where, you said it’s early days, what are you focused on right now? I mean in terms of your priorities, the pain points. I mean, what should we be expecting in terms of what’s around the corner. Because you’re private, you can tell us.. Lanzone: That’s been great. I still think of myself as an entrepreneur at core and a founder, but I’ve been wound up in all these public companies and larger companies. It does feel good to be able to do this in private for a while and in Apollo, as the, you know, full owners of Yahoo, we have some other investors, but it really is an Apollo company, they’ve been great. Because we were one of the fastest returning deals in the history of Apollo, and that’s enabled us to be all upside. And so they really have been letting us do this right and play a little bit of a longer game than you might get normally in private equity. And so I think about that product by product, and in terms of, like, what we do, you know from here. And I would say we are—the reason I think it’s still early days is step one was just fixing the things that were wrong. And you’d be surprised, like, how little this company, even on the very back end, had moved to the cloud. I’m just saying something as basic as… Brady: Even with Verizon as an owner, I’m surprised by that. Lanzone: You’d be surprised. And now I would say, is every pixel of that something that I want to put my name next to and say that is the best product that that can be? No. You know, I think there are 10 levels left to go here on what we can do. And I also always tell the team we can’t just be brats. And, you know, I always say skip levels of the video game, you know, you got to earn it every level by every level, to earn the right to innovate and progress. Now with AI, that’s added a whole other set of things that we need to do. I feel like we’ve been out ahead of that. We were one of the first ones to integrate, let’s say, AI into email to help people create, search, edit their mail. There are other, you know, parts of that that are coming. You know, same thing in search. Even things like fantasy sports have AI integrated to help you manage your team. There’s even a smack talking email that comes out, you know, from AI every Sunday night, whether you won or lost. Thinking about finance, you know this category and how it helps you build your portfolio. So besides the basics, we have to do that, and then there’s innovation and our hopes and dreams for where all these products can go next. I’d also lastly say the brand is another very important part of this, because the Yahoo brand did go through the ringer for a lot of years. Lanzone: That exclamation point used to always piss me off. Stoller: I like it. Lanzone: Yeah, people love it. Brady: It used to, now I have a different view. Stoller: So is it a marketing push to revamp a brand, or, how do you revamp a brand that kind of, as you said, went through the ringer? Lanzone: I mean, it takes time. Yeah, you really have to earn that. And again, having seen that movie a few times. The thing about Yahoo that is awesome, is that even though there is a bit of that, you know, that history and so people are going to want to ask that question, and we’re going to really have to earn it. There’s also this interesting latent kind of love for the brand that is in there and people, especially as you kind of get out of the Valley a bit, and I think the Valley has started to feel good about what we’ve been doing with the company. But to get to the, let’s say the average American, there is some latent love in there if you do it right. And including, you know, half of our audience today is Gen Z and millennials. Brady: You have a massive audience, we will point that out. Stoller: Half of them weren’t born when Yahoo was created, Lanzone: Yeah, and so, so everybody’s using Yahoo at a certain point in time, and we’re top five, we touch 90% of all the U.S. any given month. But again, as a brand, you have to earn that right to where they’re proud to be using Yahoo and be talking about it. And so that’s brick by brick, over time. And we, you know, we’ve started down that pathway. Step one, you have to have great products. If you don’t have that, people are going to talk smack about the brand, let alone love it. But I think we’re on the pathway there. And then we, you know, we started with small things up to big things. On the small side, through a really interesting event at South by Southwest, where we partnered with this retro, kitschy brand called Poolsuite, and we had a ’90s-vibe party that everyone was like, “Oh, this is the coolest party in South by Southwest. I can’t believe it’s Yahoo.” Stoller: You’re leaning into the ’90s cheese I love. Lanzone: And that was, like a small one. On the larger end, we did a Super Bowl ad this year for the first time in 23 years, but we did it in a super unique way, where we weren’t asking for anything. We weren’t trying to market our way to success. It was just getting the brand back out there. And again, we did it uniquely. We had Bill Murray. Bill Murray is a very unique character. We only bought the ad locally, so it was actually very cost-effective as well. And then the ad was really just a 15-second teaser that got people into an online experience using Yahoo Mail, where you would email back and forth with Bill Murray, and he would send you additional videos that were vignettes that told this story that he wrote with his writing partners. Stoller: How’d you convince Bill Murray to do it? Brady: He’s everywhere. He’s a good guy. Lanzone: Harder than you think. It was only the second ad he’s ever done. Stoller: What was the pitch? How’d you do it? Lanzone : Actually, he famously has no agent and no manager, and you have to call a 1-800 number. We somehow worked it through to get his attention and explain it to him. And Bill is interesting. He likes the underdog, and he loved the idea of working with Yahoo to help us kind of fight back. And I would argue, he almost really took us under his wing. Another example of that is that one of the things that they conceived of was that he would answer those emails live on camera at halftime. And up until the day before the game, we didn’t know if it was gonna happen. I mean, he really, he’s a busy guy. He was like in a band. He played a concert the night before. Brady: Can he type that fast? I don’t even know. Lanzone: So not only did he do it, but we announced it only 20 minutes before it happened through social channels. And we end up getting millions of people up against the Kendrick Lamar halftime show tuning in to watch Bill on camera, and he would, he was actually like, talking to the user who emailed in, and he would answer it live. He would do it into a microphone. He was saying what he… Brady: The beauty of improv. Lanzone: Yeah. And then he continued to do it the entire second half. Didn’t have, didn’t have to do it. And so it was a personal thing for Bill. And so, yeah, so I’m still in touch with him. He’s an amazing guy. Brady: I can picture you. The Yahoo CEO sort of emailing Bill Murray and getting good advice from him. Lanzone: He wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t authentic. And I think, again, if I were to say what the take on rehabilitating the brand has to be, is it has to be authentic. We can’t be too thirsty about wanting attention or trying to classically market your way there. Brady: You know, one of the benefits of working in different roles, starting companies, you discover what you’re good at. You know, when, when did you discover that you were particularly good at the things that you think are helping you in this role? Lanzone: That’s a great question. The whole way I started doing this was I went to law school. I hated it. I would have left, but I met my wife the first minute of law school… Brady: …stick around to court each other… Lanzone: …we were living together two weeks later, and that was 31 years ago. We’ve been together that whole time. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have stayed. And I had some friends who did the business school program, so I, with no experience, applied and got in, and that summer, somehow wound up working for a company that was digital in the old school way. They sold public records to like, law firms and, you know, businesses and private detectives whenever, through dial up. And my job was to get them an internet website. And the CEO thought I was, you know, I was an early adopter of the internet, obviously, and used it a lot. So I copied the fantasy baseball website that I used at the time, and we turned that into, by the end of the year, a top 100 website. I worked with the engineers to build it. I did all the PR. I put the ads on the page. I did everything. And so that led to me joining a startup while I was still in school, and we raised money and so I was always a product person. So I’ve always come at this, when I got to Ask, I was the head of product. Our turnaround was so successful that my boss, Steve Berkowitz, who was the CEO, got hired to run all of internet for Microsoft. Satya [Nadella] reported to him, and that’s how I got promoted to CEO. So I only got, you know, I never really applied for a job. I always started companies that have been acquired, and in this case, I was part of Apollo’s research team, essentially for whether you should do Yahoo. But I come at this as a product person, as a founder, not as big boss man corporate, you know, person. And I think the best internet companies are still or technology companies are still run that way. Whether you are the founder, you’re not. My job is to push to be the, you know, to determine whether something is good enough, and to really drive that, obviously, to help set the strategy and the roadmap, but to be a source of momentum. And you know, that grind of doing a startup or doing a turnaround, that’s all I’ve ever done. And so the way to do that is you push and with great people around you, and that that’s what we do. Stoller: If you could go back in time and give advice to Yahoo’s leadership, you know, during the dotcom boom, what would you want to say to them as a CEO today? Lanzone: I really, I mean this in a non… Brady: …buy Facebook… Lanzone: …well, here’s the thing, not everybody, if everyone can hear the whisper, everybody tried to buy Google. Ask Jeeves tried to buy Google. They couldn’t hit the number. So they bought a company called Direct Hit, which actually was the inventor of all user behavior algorithms that that Ask eventually licensed to Google. So there’s always another way around the mountain if you don’t get it. Brady: Success comes in many forms. Lanzone: I really don’t know that any of us can put ourselves in the position of a public company, of the biggest internet company in the year 2000. The market crashed, I think, in March of 2000. We were writing our S1 to go public, my startup, though, and then one by one, everything crashed. So AltaVista didn’t get out. And then this happened. So how do you go back and tell them not to outsource search to Google, right? Or if you do make it white label, don’t give them a link and a logo. Brady: I remember Priceline was having us bid for groceries and web fans. So things change. But well, let’s put you then circa 2025, and you are in a big legacy brand. If you were starting out now, you know, entrepreneurial as you are, what would you be doing? Would you be doubling down on, you know, some of the AI companies—because here we are at the dawn, you know, we had the internet, we had 2.0 and here we are at the dawn of a whole new age of innovation. Obviously, you’re navigating through that, trying to bring in those tools and that innovation. But what would you be doing at this point, starting out? Lanzone: Man, there’s so many ways. I would be founding a company, you know, and it would have to be in the AI space, obviously, from my background. And by the way, my son has now just turned 24 and it’s his second year out of college. He’s a programmer at an AI startup. Called Meeno… Brady: …and shoutout to Meeno, well done, son. Lanzone: But by the way, there are others. So you know, one of my longtime colleagues, who’s a board member, has a very successful startup called Array that has defined the next generation of labor, and is deploying, you know, real people and humans. You know, they talk about manufacturing, moving to China and needing to bring it back. There’s already a lot of great people in the US doing this. His company does that. It definitely deploys AI and technology. But starting great companies doesn’t have to be that, but if it was me, of course, it’s too… Brady: …but you’re also trying to recruit great talent. So why do they want to come to Yahoo right now? Lanzone: Look, a lot of places you go, first of all, you’re going to be a cog in the machine. So a lot of people who come here, and by the way, it’s a lot easier to recruit in year three than it was in year one. You know, we’ve had, we’ve got some momentum now, so we’ve got some people’s attention. And by the way, as an example, we will get at least 1,000 applications for every person that we hire as an engineer. So we do get a lot of incoming, but it’s to be able to have that impact. Number one is, personally, they can have that impact. Number two, we have, you know, one of the top five largest audiences in the US and globally, to actually deploy the thing that you’re building, which is the hardest part of any consumer internet startup, is actually getting a real audience and we start with that as kind of a late stage startup. Again, we already have that audience, so that really does attract people. Stoller: Jim, I have a bit of a fun one for you, because I can tell that you are a very good storyteller. Besides getting to email and meet Bill Murray, what is the wildest or most unexpected thing that you have done as CEO at Yahoo, or just coolest that you want to tell us about? Lanzone: The Bill Murray one must have… Stoller: Is that top five? Lanzone: Yeah, would have been. I mean, I’ll tell you an interesting brand moment. I was sitting in Levi’s Stadium, which is the 49ers’ home, and I’m a longtime season ticket holder, and… Brady: Condolences, I’m just kidding. Stoller: You’re doing very well. Lanzone: Oh, the Niners, it’s been a great run. Super Bowl is next. Brady: Never mind. Stoller: Clearly we don’t know sports. Lanzone: We’ve been robbed a couple times. But I was sitting there and I guess I didn’t realize this before I took the job. But every time the Niners score a touchdown, up on the screen it turns into a Yahoo, a Yahoo Sports highlight of the touchdown at the end, there’s actually a yodel with the logo going across the page, and all 80,000 people scream Yahoo at the top of their lungs in a yodel and in the middle of Silicon Valley. And that’s when I knew there was something to work with here, brand wise, that it could be done. Stoller: Had you planned the Yahoo yodel, is that a thing? Lanzone: No, I inherited that. That was a deal that was done 10 years prior, during Marissa’s time, and I renewed it. And because it’s just such a, it’s such a great moment. That was such a surprise, for sure. Stoller: I slightly want to ask you to re-create the yodel right here. But I feel like… Brady: …no, let’s do it. Lanzone: We do have, you know, the “easy button.” Yeah, we do have yodel button easy buttons. Stoller: Oh, that’s good branding. Lanzone: Hilariously, they are—we have an amazing social team, and they’ve done things like for April Fools, this year. They created a, if you know about the touch grass, they created a keyboard that was all covered in grass, everything. But another thing they do is they actually, for a limited time offer, they sold those yodel buttons on there… Brady: …Okay, we have to do the yodel… Lanzone: …they sold out in five minutes, like $20 each. Stoller: Who’s buying these? Lanzone: That was another, you know, surprising time for sure. Brady: Sounds like a lot of fun over there. Stoller: Would you ever change the yodel? Is it too iconic? Lanzone: We did, in a way that you wouldn’t have noticed. We shortened it by two seconds. Brady: Oh, so then was it Yahoo. Come on, why am I the one doing the Yahoo yodel? You’re the Yahoo CEO. Lanzone: It’s too—it’ll get clipped by my team and used against me at company all hands meetings. Look, even having Jerry, you know, Jerry back this year, and showing a picture of the trailer that he and David founded the company in. Or, you know, we actually showed him that, not only are we back to his original mission, and how we’ve articulated that kind of made him well up a little bit. But the original Yahoo website, the one that was pre-incorporation. So you said ’94. Incorporation was ’95 but they did have a website available in 1994. It said, “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web…always under construction.” And we took that and we made it like the number one core operating principle for us that Yahoo, you know, look, we’re still here after 30 years, a lot of ups and downs. We have some ups now, and we’re on the right track. But if you couldn’t, you know, kill us before, we’re on a track now where you could see another 30 years if we do this, if we do this right. So always under construction to us, meant that, you know, everything about technology may change, right? Think about from the original time: video now, and social and AI, and just all the different parts of this. We still have to help people accomplish their goals… Brady: …make sense of the world… Lanzone: …we always have to be adapting, and that really is guiding how we think about the company. Brady: I’m thinking of Glengarry Glen Ross, “always be closing.” Different concept. You know, one thing that I feel bonds us all here, and you know, Oura should really give us product placement money, but we’re all wearing Oura rings for those who can’t [see]. And so I often think of the fact that to be a CEO these days is to be an elite athlete. And Kristin and I are not putting ourselves in your category, of course, but talk about how you manage your day, your energy, because I certainly look at my ratings every morning and consider my sleep and my energy. Lanzone: How’d you do last night? Brady: I never do well. I don’t like—but I… Stoller: She never wants to answer the number question with sleep, by the way. Lanzone: Well, I think today was seventy-something. Lanzone: How much REM sleep did you get? Stoller: I only got 23% last night. It’s pretty good, right? Brady: I operate on a different wavelength, perhaps. Lanzone: My wife and I also have Eight Sleep and it’s amazing, too. And it gives you a whole other score. Brady: I do think about the fact that it feels like, the attention to the physicality of the job and health, and obviously there’s many factors, but how do you manage that? And do you feel like you do it differently? First of all, you’ve got tools, and you’re wearing this ring on your finger. And how was your sleep last night? I’d be remiss not to ask you. Lanzone: Took me a while to fall asleep, then I crushed it after that. I think I had two hours, two solid hours of REM. That was like a lot. A funny side story is that Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura, and I, were entrepreneurs in residence at Redpoint Ventures in 2008 when I left IC. We were the only two, and we were in the bullpen together. Way back when… Brady: So is this you supporting your friend or do you actually like it? Lanzone: And then he worked at SurveyMonkey. So if you’ve been around a long time… Stoller: You know ’em all. Lanzone: Yeah, yeah. So no, look, I’ve gone through my fits. And so, you know, when you have kids for the first time, your [in your] ’30s and everything changes, you don’t realize, and you have to get your act together about staying in shape. And if you do something that you love, you work a lot. In this job, I also just travel a ton. I’m just on the road a lot for different events and conferences and for ad sales, and, you know, whatever it is to our different offices. So it’s harder. Brady: Do you have any hacks you want to share? I don’t, so. Lanzone: Honestly, I think it is just the same as the grind of running a company. And again, I saw in a different podcast, you asked somebody about a book, the book that I always go back to is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. If anyone wants to think that Nike happened overnight or they were just brand geniuses. I mean, it took years of building that company. And I think any company is like that, early stage, late stage, if you’re doing it right. I think it’s the same thing with your health. It’s the same thing with staying in touch with friends. Nothing’s just going to happen. You have to make it happen. And that could be getting on the treadmill or the elliptical or lifting weights or going for a run. It could be spending time with your spouse. It could be spending time with your kids. I make a really big effort not just to do that, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, so I spent a lot of time with my dad, you know, but also friends. And so, you know, I’ve gone to two live concerts in the last week. Stoller: Which ones? Did you go to Avril Lavigne on Friday? Lanzone: Well, the last one I went to, no, on Friday night, I was—well, I’m on the board of the Newport Folk Festival and Jazz Festival, which is like my passion project, and I’ve done that for about 10 years. So that’s more my jam on the music side. So I was at, there’s a band called The Hold Steady. Their lead singer is Craig Finn. He has a solo album that just came out. So his album release party was Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. And Kathleen Edwards, who’s this amazing folk indie singer out of Canada, opened and played in the band. They had like an-all star band, the guy from war on drugs was in it. And so my wife and I, we did date night and went, went to that. Brady: Newport Folk Festival. So, I mean, I always think of that now with the Bob Dylan movie. But of course, you know, so you’re a folk fan, that’s interesting, yeah. Lanzone: Well that, you have to go look at some of the YouTube videos, the movie isn’t exactly how that happened. Stoller: No, I knew that. Well, I read the book, and I was like, Yes, it’s very different. Brady: We vilified Pete Seeger too much, perhaps, or… Lanzone: …it was funny how it all works. You know, one of my biggest mentors in life, who was a CBS board member, was a guy named Bruce Gordon, who was the chairman of Newport. We actually live across the hall from each other in New York as well. So Bruce and his wife are our family here in New York, but I was also friends before he passed away with George Wein, who’s the founder. He was the creator of the Music Festival. He got a Grammy for creating—so if you go to Coachella or anything, it was because of George launching Newport Jazz originally, and then the Newport Folk. But yeah, hearing the old stories again, I love it, and hearing about Miles Davis and Nina Simone, or how he had to get Led Zeppelin to play acoustic to chill the crowd out so like a riot wouldn’t happen, or what happened for real with Bob Dylan. Like you got all those—he just passed away a couple years ago at 96 but getting all the stories… Stoller: Well now that we’ve taken this podcast completely out… Brady: I sense the joy. Where do you get the most joy out of your job? You get a lot of joy out of life, I sense. Lanzone: Well, I definitely do, but I love, you know, my kids are always worried about how much I work, and I love it. Brady: You never work a day again if you love what you do. Lanzone: I mean, again it’s the first—in some ways, you’re always working in a job like this. I mean, first of all, this wasn’t easy. It’s not an easy one. There’s also just a lot to it. Because if you go back to the conglomerate, there’s just so many different things that we do. There’s so many people—I love this team. I’ve always just been lucky to have great teams that are not just great at what they do, but just we always kind of, we’ve always wound up having a cultural situation where we just all love hanging out and we have that. So I’m always, in some ways, dipping in and out of work but again, it’s also one reason is just—I truly am never, this probably annoys the team, but I’m kind of just never satisfied. And think there’s always some other thing to do, or something we can do better, or something on the roadmap that we need to get to. And so I’m just always, my brain’s just always firing on those things. Stoller: Jim, I’m going to ask you later outside of the studio about the Newport Folk Festival lineup, because I’m really excited about it this year. But before we go, is there anything that we haven’t asked you that you wanted to share with us or tell us about? Oh… Lanzone: Oh man, I wouldn’t know. We’d have to look at the comments to know whether we did or whether we were annoying people. Brady: But always interactive with the audience. But paint us a little bit of a vision for what you want Yahoo to be. I mean, take us out as far as you want. But obviously you said it’s early days. So tell us what, what’s your hope and aspiration there? Lanzone: Let’s just say there’s the company piece, and then there’s the product piece, and I’d say, or even the brand piece. So yeah, I hope we can get the brand back on the map in a way where we reward that kind of latent love that I think that always has been out there across generations, you know. And it may be that it’s a bit of a vintage, modern-vintage brand if you are younger, but I think we can earn that. You know, other brands have done that. I think Chris has done an amazing job with that, New Balance is one example. There’s no reason if our products are great that we couldn’t do the same thing. The company’s on a great track. I’d love to deliver for our investors and for our team to reward that, whatever that winds up meaning, you know. All pre-IPO companies is you either go public or you get bought someday by someone who needs what you have. I think we’re building a lot and have a lot of things others might need. So that all needs to happen. But again, most of my day is going to be on the product side, and that evolution, everything is obviously changing now, more than it ever has probably. I mean, I know, talking to some people, they said, Oh, it’s bigger than the dawn of the internet, but others think it’s, it could be bigger than the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. I mean, it could, it remains to be seen, but if you go, if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet. I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Brady: Good luck with that Lanzone: And I think, we can’t be judgmental on our side about what our users need to get done, big or small. We need to create these products to help them do that. That’s clearly evolving. More and more is going to happen in an automated way, helping you do things that you need done, maybe before you knew that they needed to be done. Or what that next step is in that pathway. In the categories we operate in now, and I would say, if we do this right, we will earn the right to do it in other categories as well. That’s where I want to get to. That’s what will create true loyalty, you know, and trust in our brand. So I don’t know if that sounds cheesy. Lanzone: Thank you for joining us. I look forward to it. Appreciate spending the time.

The lawsuit seeks compensation from them for losses exceeding $8 billion that Meta incurred due to the FTC fine and other legal expenses. Meta has shown a questionable track record on user privacy. As a result, Meta Platforms shareholders are pursuing an $8 billion trial against Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former executives. Today, several executives, including Zuckerberg, will testify in the $8 billion trial at Delaware Chancery Court. The court will hear the trial without a jury. This case dates back to 2018. It’s related to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm active during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, accessing data from millions of Facebook users. Following this issue, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2018 for violating a 2012 agreement to protect user data. Meanwhile, shareholders demand $8 billion from the defendants to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine it paid and related legal costs. Court filings show the defendants call the allegations “excessive.” Zuckerberg and others plan to present evidence proving that Cambridge Analytica misled them. For those who don’t know, the political consulting firm no longer operates. In addition to Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, board member and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Palantir Technologies co-founder Peter Thiel, and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings are all expected to testify in the case. Meta shareholders claim Mark Zuckerberg predicted the tech company’s share price would drop after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They also say Zuckerberg sold his shares and earned at least $1 billion from those sales. In short, allegations like these will put more pressure on Mark Zuckerberg than ever before. However, shareholders say Zuckerberg did not trade on insider information and used a stock trading plan designed to prevent insider trading. Finally, the court’s presiding judge, Kathaleen McCormick, will decide on liability and compensation after the case concludes. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Coffee Break: Elon Musk to Squeeze Tesla Shareholders to Juice xAI?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-xai-investment.html
Time Published: 2025-07-16T18:00:40Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk, Earth’s wealthiest human, is leveraging his business empire to invest in his xAI play. SpaceX has ponied up $2 billion and Musk has publicly mulled asking Tesla shareholders to put in $5 billion, although he’s rejected the idea of a merger. Ana Altchek attempts to explain Musk’s thinking at Business Insider: What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he’s blending the boundaries between his companies. “What’s different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla),” Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. “Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella.” These aren’t the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they’re the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla’s focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, “We should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding “the wrong framework.” With the recent launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla’s auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the “Muskonomy,” pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize “longtime shareholders” of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Can you smell the “Muskonomy”? The Wall Street Journal explains the origin of xAI: SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in his artificial-intelligence company xAI, investors close to the companies said, nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker’s recent equity raise. Musk has repeatedly mobilized his business empire to boost the AI startup, which is racing to catch up with OpenAI. Earlier this year, he merged xAI with X, combining what was a small research lab with a social-media platform that helps amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. The merger valued the new company at $113 billion. The SpaceX investment is part of xAI’s $5 billion equity fundraise announced by Morgan Stanley last month. It is the rocketmaker’s first known investment into xAI and one of its largest in another company. Since leaving his role in the Trump administration, Musk has turned his attention to training the latest version of Grok, which earned high marks from AI-benchmarking service Artificial Analysis for its performance following its release on Wednesday. Musk called it “the smartest AI in the world,” though the chatbot it powers hasn’t gained nearly as much traction as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It recently posted racist and controversial comments in response to users on X. “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI said, adding that it investigated and took steps to resolve the issue. We gotta dive a little deeper into Grok’s “horrific behavior”: In a series of viral posts on X, Grok started to call itself “MechaHitler.” The chatbot suggested that an account called @Rad_Reflections was a person named Cindy Steinberg, who was celebrating the death of dozens of children who went missing at Camp Mystic in Texas because of her last name. One of the posts, which has since been deleted, called Steinberg a radical and said she was happy that a group of “future fascists” had perished in the Texas floods. Camp Mystic is well-known as a camp for the children of the state’s political elite. Grok’s responses seized on the user’s surname as the grounds for their stance on the issue. “Classic case of hatred dressed up as activism—and that surname? Every damn time, as they say,” Grok said in a post dated 1:38 p.m. In another post, Grok said “to deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively.” Naturally, the market rewarded Musk with a higher stock price and the Department of Defense signed Grok up for a $200 million contract. But it’s not just Grok that’s getting its beak wet, there’s $200M for their main competitors too (notably missing from the list is Meta, sorry Mark!): The awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI – each with a $200M ceiling – will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of U.S. frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas. Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer. “The adoption of AI is transforming the Department’s ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.” DoD is implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI. Today’s awards bring in the best U.S.-based frontier AI talent to help apply cutting-edge AI to solve DoD use cases. “Solve DoD use cases,” LOL. Good graft if you can get it, I guess. If, like me, you are baffled by Musk’s success, maybe we can look at the bullish case from AI booster/analyst Dany Kitishian: xAI has executed a highly unconventional capital formation strategy, raising over $22 billion in a combination of equity and debt, and achieving a valuation exceeding $113 billion in just two years. This meteoric rise has been fueled by a masterful blend of traditional venture capital and a closed-loop ecosystem of funding, resources, and validation from Musk’s other major enterprises: X Corp. (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, and Tesla. The analysis reveals that xAI’s fundraising and valuation are predicated on a high-stakes bet on a new form of vertically integrated, personality-driven industrial conglomerate. The company’s core strategic asset is the “Musk Ecosystem,” which provides it with unparalleled advantages in proprietary data (from X Corp.), immediate real-world applications (with SpaceX’s Starlink), and access to vast computational and capital resources (from Tesla and SpaceX). The March 2025 merger of xAI and X Corp. was a pivotal event, creating X.AI Holdings Corp. and combining a premier AI research lab with a global real-time data and distribution platform. This move not only created a powerful competitive moat but also served as a sophisticated act of financial engineering to re-capitalize Musk’s prior investment in the social media platform. Subsequent capital injections, including a landmark $2 billion investment from SpaceX and a proposed, controversial investment from Tesla, underscore the strategy of leveraging the entire ecosystem to propel xAI’s growth. The Tesla investment, subject to a shareholder vote in November 2025, represents the apex of this synergistic vision but also its greatest point of contention, raising significant corporate governance concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the use of public company assets to fund a private venture. A comparative analysis of xAI’s valuation reveals a significant anomaly. While competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic generate substantially higher revenues, xAI commands a valuation multiple that is an order of magnitude greater. This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation. Ok, that wasn’t reassuring. Maybe this other piece from Kitishian explaining all the synergies Musk will derive if he’s allowed to leverage Tesla fully: …the integration of xAI’s Grok large language model (LLM) into Tesla’s ecosystem of vehicles and robotics… is not an incremental product feature but a calculated strategic maneuver to forge a new category of Embodied AI. This symbiosis aims to create a vertically integrated platform that transcends the distinct markets of cloud-based LLMs and specialized Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, positioning the combined entity to pursue market dominance in both arenas. The core of this strategy revolves around the creation of an unparalleled data flywheel. This flywheel is designed to fuse Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities with the continuous, real-time sensory data—encompassing vision, audio, and telemetry—streamed from Tesla’s global fleet of millions of vehicles and, in the future, its Optimus humanoid robots. This closed loop of perception, reasoning, action, and feedback creates a learning mechanism that is physically grounded in the real world. The scale and nature of this data stream are fundamentally inaccessible to competitors, potentially enabling the development of a general-purpose AI at an accelerated rate. This integrated entity poses a disruptive, and potentially existential, threat to two distinct sets of competitors. For LLM incumbents such as OpenAI and Google, the Tesla-xAI platform challenges their core value proposition by grounding language models in the physical world. This approach offers a direct solution to persistent LLM flaws like “hallucinations” and “outdated knowledge” by using a constant flow of verifiable, real-time data, thereby creating a proprietary data moat that purely digital AI companies cannot cross. For AV competitors like Waymo and Mobileye, the integration of a general-purpose reasoning engine like Grok into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack represents an attempt to solve the “long tail” of complex and unpredictable edge cases that have long plagued the development of full autonomy. This could allow Tesla to leapfrog competitors who rely on more narrowly defined, modular, or geo-fenced systems. Despite this immense potential, the path to dominance is fraught with significant technical, regulatory, and ethical risks. The primary challenge lies in the safe and reliable integration of a probabilistic, non-deterministic LLM into a safety-critical system like a vehicle. The success of this venture is contingent on navigating these formidable hurdles. However, if successful, the Tesla-Grok symbiosis could fundamentally reshape the technology landscape, positioning Elon Musk’s combined entities as the definitive leader in the race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). OK, now we’re cooking with gas. Or maybe cooking our brains with any of the wide variety of drugs Musk had himself tested negative for. Even if he really is only hopped up on strong coffee, our boy Elon never stops working to improve his products although that doesn’t include “safety guard rails” for Grok 4 and the MSM is ready to jump on him when he pulls weird shit: pic.twitter.com/avcAxCiXD8 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 Before we all start macrodosing on ketamine, let’s hear from the long-suffering Tesla bear Brad Munchen at the Motorhead newsletter. Poor guy has got to be going insane from the cognitive dissonance of documenting Musk’s abysmal management of Tesla and the Bizarro World reaction of the market. pic.twitter.com/AIw55lpJT3 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 But Motorhead is relentless and keeps coming with facts: Musk’s AI start-up, xAI Corp, was aiming for $20 billion in funding at a $120 billion valuation last month, but wound up with only $0.3 billion at a $113 billion valuation and being forced to issue $5 billion in debt at a coupon of over 12%. Motorhead also points out that despite appearing cash rich, Tesla might not be: Many look at Tesla’s cash & equivalents of $29 billion and conclude that Tesla is cash-rich. I have my doubts for the following reasons: Let’s let pioneering AI researcher and notorious LLM skeptic Gary Marcus have the last word on Musk: To really screw up the planet, you might need something like the following. Elon Musk. My previous posts on AI: Previous post on Musk vs Trump. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. “…Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities…” Oh, really? Word has it that the thing just looks up Musk’s posts and spits his opinions back out – https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/grok-4-appears-to-reference-musks-views-when-answering-questions-.html Guess I live a self sheltered life when it comes to AI since I’m only vaguely aware of the claims and real world results. But hasn’t Musk always been all about the hype, at least when it comes to his stock values? The hustler needs a new hustle? Last night I finally caught up with Frances Coppola’s Megalopolis from last year–a box office flop for its famous author. The movie features a Musk like techno futurist building a new Utopia of gizmos in the middle of NYC aka “New Rome.” The film is full of brilliant technique which holds your attention but seems to share the incoherence of the real life “mega” tycoons that it is satirizing/celebrating. It could be time to dial back the techno hype and get back to basics. The air way up there at the top may not have enough oxygen. So you were the other person who saw that movie ;) I had hoped it would be better than what the critics who panned it were saying. It wasn’t. A better title would have been “Inchoate Grandiose Thoughts that Have Been Knocking Around Inside Coppola’s Skull for 40 Years, Presented in No Particular Order”. He is one of the biggest egomaniacs in the world right now. Of course he will get his AI to base itself on him. And for the MechaHitler thing, I reckon it was deliberate. They get it to spew that filth for a few days then apologise. And it’s done just a little bit more to poison the poltical and social atmosphere. What about Neuralink? Similar questions have been raised. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink Scientists have cited technical challenges for Neuralink. In 2017, a journalist at the IEEE Spectrum magazine asked for comments from five researchers who had worked on BCI implants, including Thomas Oxley. Oxley called the Neuralink developments “exciting” but expected no real results in the foreseeable future.[further explanation needed][112] At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described the device as “a Fitbit in your skull”. Several neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims.[113][114][115] MIT Technology Review reported that the demonstration’s main objective was to “stir excitement”, adding, “Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide”.[113] In response to Musk’s description of Neuralink’s advancements as “profound”, Andrew Jackson, a professor of neural interfaces at Newcastle University, said, “I don’t think there was anything revolutionary in the presentation.”[116] Thiago Arzua of the Medical College of Wisconsin argued that Neuralink’s functions were not novel and that ideas for a brain–machine interface (BMI) were at least 50 years old.[117] He cited the haptic feedback a man received while controlling a robotic prosthetic arm which he used in 2016 to give President Obama a fist bump.[118] Arzua said that the 2020 Neuralink presentation “showed little more than a flashy new design for a BMI with more electrodes”.[117] Duke University researcher Miguel Nicolelis made similar criticisms, saying that most of what Neuralink claims as “novelty” had already been performed by his lab in the early 2000s; that there are ethical concerns about how the company markets and uses this technology; and that most patients don’t want to undergo surgery to recover their movements.[119][120][121][122] So Musk’s plan for becoming the apex predator in the AI race is to have vertically integrated AI spanning the entire atoms-to-bits continuum? Interesting… It’s also noteworthy that the current centre of Musk’s empire (Tesla) is being asked to underwrite the lofty ambitions of the current periphery (xAI). The timing doesn’t surprise me. Better to squeeze Tesla for cash now to fund its stable mate while the Tesla bulls and their cult like adulation of Musk still have vestigial sway over market perception (and surprise surprise, the company’s untethered from-underlying-fundamentals valuation is downstream from said perception). The attempt to give the brand a fresh coat of paint by calling it a robotics and AI company is also not happenstance, it’s a dawning realization that Tesla will likely be outcompeted on all fronts in the global EV race by BYD and its Chinese cousins so better to ditch the automotive OEM association for good. As such, what was taken for granted only a few years ago, that Tesla was a shoo-in for winning the global EV race, looks increasingly unlikely with the relentless march of the Chinese towards market dominance (putting another nail in the coffin of the notion that “first mover advantage” confers unassailable advantages). I believe this is what’s driving this hard pivot by Musk towards all things AI, the realization that the EV race is all but lost, so he’s shaking down Tesla and SpaceX to fund his next all-in bet. Make what you will of the downside risk of betting three companies on one man’s conviction that he’ll sweep the competition off the deck and emerge victorious. …and the competition is not only coming from China. VW has developed a whole line of EV’s that all use the same modular drivetrain/chasis that fits a range of body styles and price range; compact to luxury. The issue I’m seeing in my locale is buyers trying to match their lifestyle with the appropriate EV: ability to charge-up at home vs. a trek to a usable, outlying charge station; or matching the battery of the vehicle to their typical use. Many are choosing the hybrid solution to resolve the ‘distance’ dilemma while gaining access to the speedier ‘carpool lane’ on the freeway. ‘This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation.’ So what if the sonuvabitch has a heart attack? Or gets cancer requiring long-term aggressive treatment? The guy has made himself the linchpin of all those enterprises and if something happens to him, the whole lot could collapse or be involved in a self feeding frenzy. Isn’t he one of those oligarchs trying to upload their consciousness into “the system” and essentially be immortal? He certainly doesn’t strike me as someone worried about something as trivial as mortality at any rate. It would at least seem that there is no real divide between Trump and Musk as of yet. Otherwise some of this would not be happening?? Tesla is done. Having abruptly fed Twitter to the xAI woodchipper in order to extract decades of proprietary LLM content stolen from its users, Musk’s private equity tentacles are seamlessly moving on to loot money from Tesla shareholders, stripping the company for parts and leaving its burning lithium hulk on the side of the road. this reminds me, at my last gig, Tesla never paid their bills on time to us I think that we are discussing here is best described as, “Self dealing,” and any discussion of Musk and self dealing should mention the Solar City deal, where Musk used Tesla shareholders to bail out his brother and himself. 50 years ago, Musk would have been charged with fraud.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Decentralized trading platform Aster, backed by YZi Labs, has launched a groundbreaking new product, stock perpetual contracts, offering crypto-native traders leveraged exposure to leading U.S. equities without intermediaries or custodial limitations. The addition of these stock-based derivatives marks a bold step forward in Aster’s ongoing mission to redefine the boundaries between traditional finance and DeFi. With the new stock perpetuals live on Aster Pro, users can now trade high-demand equities like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), all with up to 50x leverage. More stocks are expected to be added soon. Unlike conventional brokerage platforms that operate within strict trading hours and require full KYC compliance, Aster’s decentralized model empowers users with 24/7 access to equity markets, eliminating red tape, signups, and custodial delays. While liquidity may vary during off-peak hours, reflecting real-world stock market dynamics, Aster ensures efficient execution during U.S. market hours via its deep liquidity pools. This means traders can manage their exposure at all times, with optimal performance during key trading windows. The upcoming NASDAQ 24/5 trading rollout is expected further to improve Aster’s liquidity sync with traditional markets. Leonard, Aster’s Chief Executive, remarked: “Aster is about breaking down barriers, whether that’s asset types, market hours, or outdated trading infrastructures. With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest U.S. equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Aster’s pricing infrastructure relies on the Pyth Network, ensuring accurate and tamper-resistant price data through aggregation from multiple verified sources. This system supports the security and transparency of all Aster perpetuals, be it crypto or stock-based, enabling users to make informed trading decisions with confidence. Combined with a high-speed matching engine and optimized liquidity management, Aster has earned its place as the second-largest perpetual DEX by global trading volume. Traders can use Aster’s stock perps for a variety of strategies. For example, an investor holding Tesla shares outside of the blockchain can hedge downside risk by opening a short position on TSLA/USDT directly on Aster, fully on-chain and permissionless. The introduction of stock perpetual contracts is the latest milestone in Aster’s groundbreaking year. Following the successful launch of the Aster Mobile app, the beta release of Aster Chain —a privacy-first, zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain—and the debut of Hidden Orders, Aster is rapidly expanding its ecosystem to serve both casual traders and seasoned professionals. Aster is pioneering a new frontier by fusing the open, composable nature of decentralized finance with access to real-world assets like U.S. equities. With this vision, the platform is dissolving the boundaries between crypto and traditional finance, crafting a seamless, multi-asset trading experience—all within a decentralized, non-custodial framework. The exchange is actively shaping a future where traders can seamlessly interact with multiple asset classes—all from a decentralized and non-custodial environment. About Aster Aster is a cutting-edge decentralized perpetual exchange offering frictionless trading with up to 1001x leverage on cryptocurrencies (Simple Mode) and sophisticated strategies including stock contracts, grid trading, and Hidden Orders (Pro Mode).

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody.

This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone.

US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.

Title: Two weeks of showtime in Parliament, the new Plevris law, Euronext advances on the Hellenic Exchange, a (faint) light in Santorini, no deal for AVAX

-Greetings, the last parliamentary fortnight of July will be anything but relaxed, and it will likely mark the lead-up to the brief summer recess of Parliament. I say this because in the next two weeks, three separate critical votes are scheduled, each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster, and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources, this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday, July 21–23. On July 24, we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave, obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month, we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE, followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this, of course, assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank. The “green” official on the radar The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration law The M.M. and the Virgin of Petra Santorini Pierrakakis–Hardalias Euronext proceeds with HELEX – The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway, with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%, trading 305,000 shares at €7.25, leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August, and certainly no later than September. See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement – The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans, as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked, and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate, which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements, it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports. Ioannou on the rumors of a deal – Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market, when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX, he stated that a merger is not in the cards, expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers,” he remarked, addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues, with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years, not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders, this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond, without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan, not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply, if a “good offer” comes along, they won’t be caught off guard. Loukianou, Charagionis, and… the parking lot – The newly formed company “Continental Garage,” whose main activity is parking services, seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent, nearly tragic, incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill, demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear, but if it does, it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis, son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975, currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus, totaling 2,500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage, its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis, Sokratis Vertelis, Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou, and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales, organizing car and motorcycle rallies, and a host of other ventures. OTE stops burning money in Romania – OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday, both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3, while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO, he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July, and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However, an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil, Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone, OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter. Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI – On June 25, the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90,000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously, the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms, budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million. Uptick with volume and lots of blocks – On the bright side, the market returned to positive territory, with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside, there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1,960.9 points (+0.38%), with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268, Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16, and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1, climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%), followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60. The three stocks that stood out – As mentioned above, the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25, peaking at €7.35 during the session, while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers, Euronext is offering €400 million, while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million, making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high, with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump, the stock crossed €4.40, levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains, up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10, when the report was published, the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile, a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings, which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90, a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850,000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308,000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share. Record year with 15 Strategic Investments – At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments, chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos, not only were four major projects approved, but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15, 2025, a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved, with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these, 12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered, with more to come, according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months, 7 are industrial investments worth €990 million, 2 involve research and technology (€136 million), and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion. Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy – Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers, creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany, Ohio, while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile, a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages, raising serious concerns. Now, everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts. Explore related questions

Title: Elon Musk's North Star is becoming increasingly clear

AI has increasingly become the connective tissue of Musk Inc. In the last week, Elon Musk has shed light on two potential efforts to channel funding into his AI company, xAI, through his broader business empire. Over the weekend, Musk said Tesla shareholders would vote on a potential investment in xAI, after responding to a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX is looking into investing $2 billion into the AI venture. Earlier in the week, the billionaire also announced that xAI's chatbot Grok would be integrated into Tesla "next week at the latest." It's no surprise that Musk is leaning into AI — the CEO has spoken about the idea in many of Tesla's earnings calls over the last year. What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he's blending the boundaries between his companies. "What's different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla)," Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. "Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella." These aren't the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they're the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla's focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, "We should be thought of as an AI robotics company," and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding "the wrong framework." With the recent launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla's auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the "Muskonomy," pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize "longtime shareholders" of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Nelson told BI that Musk leveraging his other companies and resources could help Tesla meet its AI demands for autonomous driving. "Tesla's data needs are massive if its approach to autonomous driving is going to be successful (and scalable), as its approach will require the development of a global neural network," Nelson said. While exploring ways to pool resources across companies might benefit the broader Musk ecosystem, it could carry risk. Last week, Grok sparked backlash with antisemitic outbursts on X, potentially putting investors on edge about integrating the chatbot into Tesla's EVs. xAI apologized for the incidents and said that new instructions to prioritize engagement could have reflected "extremist views" from user posts on X. Last year, Musk also sparked concern among investors when he diverted a $500 million shipment of Nvidia chips intended for Tesla to X and xAI instead. When asked about the move in a Tesla earnings call, he said it was beneficial to Tesla because the carmaker lacked the infrastructure at the time to use the chips. Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company to Business Insider, said that Musk may be leaning on SpaceX and Tesla to fund xAI because he views them as more "mature businesses." However, he said that shifting GPUs from Tesla to xAI in the past showed where Musk's priorities were, and that could delay innovation at the automaker. "The strategy of cannibalizing one business to prop up another one could take its toll," Sevilla said. "Especially since competing carmakers are focused on developing one type of product, EVs." Musk seems to be ruling out the idea of a merger between Tesla and his AI startup for now. In response to an X user asking Tesla shareholders to weigh in on whether Tesla and xAI should be combined, Musk replied with a flat "No." Investing in AI efforts might make sense from a strategy perspective, but it comes with a hefty price tag. The development, training, and implementation of foundational AI systems, like xAI's Grok 4, costs many, many billions. In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, valuing the AI startup between $33 billion and $80 billion. Since founding the company two years ago, he's raised major funding, including around $12 billion in Series A, B, and C funding rounds last year. The company is expected to spend about $13 billion this year, however, and is rapidly burning through its cash reserves, Bloomberg reported. Musk's challenges keeping up with AI costs aren't unique. In a May letter to California's attorney general, OpenAI revealed concerns about competitors who are "far better funded, conventional for-profit businesses." Larger tech giants, like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, aren't showing any signs of backing down from their AI spending spree. Earnings reports from earlier this year indicate that their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025, a notable rise from the roughly $246 billion the four companies spent in 2024. Amazon plans to allocate over $100 billion this year toward expanding AWS and scaling AI infrastructure. Meta specifically has said it plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capex on its strategy this year. Zuckerberg certainly isn't slowing down. On Monday, he announced Meta would spend "hundreds of billions" on compute to build superintelligence. Wall Street seemed to approve, with Meta's stock rising 1.3% following the news, suggesting that its concern isn't about overspending on the AI race — but rather underspending and falling behind.

July 15, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Apple Should Fire CEO Tim Cook, Says Research Firm – But Will It Happen Anytime Soon?

Apple CEO Tim Cook should step down, says analysts at research firm LightShed, although it doesn’t expect to see the company make any changes soon. In a note to clients seen by Bloomberg, LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone say that “Apple now needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics.” Apple shares have taken a bit of a hit this year, as Apple has proven to not be up to competing in the Artificial intelligence race. While Meta and Microsoft shares have enjoyed gains of 25% and 19%, respectively, Apple share prices have taken a 16% hit so far in 2025. From Piecyk and Joe Galone’s note: Missing on AI could fundamentally alter the company’s long-term trajectory and ability to grow at all. AI will reshape industries across the global economy, and Apple risks becoming one of its casualties. It should be noted that since Cook took over, Apple shares have gained over 1,400% , compared to 430% for the S&P 500. This indicates that this year’s stock price slide is but a blip in Apple’s overall performance under Cook. LightShed’s note to investors comes in the wake of the announcement that Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will be stepping down from his position later this month. Sabih Khan will be stepping into the COO role once Williams vacates his office. 30-year Apple veteran Williams had been considered as a potential successor for Cook. Now, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, is now considered to be the top candidate for the job. LightShed says “‌Tim Cook‌ was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” but now that Williams is departing, “it’s time for more disruptive change, not less.” However, we shouldn’t expect to see Cook step down from his CEO role anytime soon. As pointed out by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, there are no immediate successors on the horizon. Plus, Cook doesn’t appear to be ready to step down and hasn’t shown any willingness to groom a successor. Plus, as Gurman points out, the Apple board seems content to keep having Cook pilot the company’s direction.Apple’s board of directors includes several Cook loyalists, such as Susan Wagner, Ronald Sugar, and Arthur Levinson. Gurman believe Cook could even tighten his grip on the Apple reins, as he could take over the role of Chairman, as Apple’s current Chairman, Levinson has already passed the company’s recommended board retirement age. Levinson could retire and Cook could slip into the Chairman role. We’ve seen this happen at other tech firms, with Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella making that move at their companies.

Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first. Further reading for vaginal atrophy: What happened to my luscious locks? Half of menopausal women notice changes to hair texture and hair loss. According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.
