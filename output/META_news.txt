Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes.

Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too.

The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Look back on the day's business news and developments as it happened with our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Emily Stewart Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Kate Ainsworth We'll be back again tomorrow for the latest unemployment figures coming from the ABS — but if you're hungry for more news, here's what's coming up on The Business tonight: Catch The Business on ABC News at 8:45pm, after the late news on ABC TV, and anytime on ABC iview. You can also catch up on today's developments below, and download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest news. By Kate Ainsworth The ASX 200 has ended lower on Wednesday, shedding 0.7% to close at 8,419 points. On the sectors front, energy and bank stocks dragged local shares lower — shedding 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. As for individual stocks, it was Mineral Resources which suffered the biggest hit. MinRes shares dipped by more than 21% in response to posting a loss of more than $800 million, and scrapping its interim dividend. Shares in NAB also fell during trade today, after the bank reported a 2% decline in cash earnings, and having its underlying profit increase offset by a higher credit impairment charge. The top performing stocks of the day were: And the bottom performing stocks: By Kate Ainsworth It's still company reporting season — and there's a few ASX heavyweights yet to drop their earnings results this month. Wondering who's left? Let this handy interactive calendar be your guide 👇 And if you need a refresher on how EBITDA differs EPS, look no further than this evergreen resource from the desk of Michael Janda: By Kate Ainsworth While there's more factors at play than just wages data for the RBA to consider before changing interest rates, Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says he expects we will see more cuts in the next 12 months. "If I were to make a prediction, I would say that a year from today the interest rate could be somewhere between 3% and 3.25%,"he said. "That is because the overall macroeconomic picture is favourable to a reduction in the interest rate. "There are however some risks, the main risk is related to international trade policy, we will have to see what happens with tariffs. "Tariffs can obviously have an impact on prices and therefore they could represent the potential source of future inflationary pressures. "But in spite of this risk, I still believe there could be a few more cuts in the next 12 months." By Kate Ainsworth Optus's parent company Singapore Telecommunications (also known as SingTel) shared its third quarter profit update earlier today — with the telco company seeing its underlying net profit climb by 22% to S$680 million ($797,368,000). That result was largely driven by Optus, which is SingTel's biggest revenue generator. In the third-quarter, Optus's revenue rose by 3% to S$1.86 billion (roughly $2.2 billion). SingTel also noted that its profit was boosted by its stake in India's Bharti Airtel, which saw a nearly sixfold increase in its own third-quarter net profit. SingTel expects to pay a total ordinary dividend of roughly 16.5 Singapore cents per share. By Kate Ainsworth Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says today's wages data shows the RBA's decision to cut interest rates was the right one. "The overall situation is one where inflationary pressures have been reduced quite significantly, and this explains why the RBA decided to cut the interest rate," he said. "This latest data on wages confirms that one of the main drivers of inflationary pressures, which is wages growth, is actually normalising. "Therefore I would say that, taken in context, the decision of the RBA aligns with the overall macroeconomic conditions that we observe in Australia." You can watch his full interview with finance presenter Nadia Daly below: By Kate Ainsworth Speaking in Adelaide, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has stressed that the state government's decision to put the Whyalla steelworks into administration is about protecting the plant and industry more broadly. "There was an option that we could provide assistance to GFG and Mr Gupta [owner of GFG Alliance], there was an option that we could have bailed out GFC, but we are not going to do that," he said. "This is not about GFG, this is about the critical economic infrastructure that is steelmaking production in this country. "That is the future we need to focus on, not an individual owner of the steelworks. "Our mind turns to providing support for the industry and for the people that work within it to secure sovereign steelmaking in this country, not a bailout for GFG." Our colleagues in Adelaide are covering this breaking story too — you can read more about the SA government's intervention below: By Michael Janda The wage price index is designed to measure changes in base pay — it doesn't capture the effects of promotions, overtime, more people working longer hours and other factors that will push up the pay employees actually receive. A relatively new measure of total wages does, and was also released today by the ABS. It showed that employers paid a total of $102.0 billion in wages and salaries during December 2024, which was up 5.7 per cent from $96.4 billion in December 2023. "This was slower than the growth of 7.3 per cent in December 2023, which reflects the relatively weaker labour market conditions during 2024," noted Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. "As an aggregate measure of total wages and salaries, the Monthly Employee Earnings Indicator captures all of the compositional changes in the labour market. This includes changes in employment, hours employees were paid for, pay rises and periodic payments. "It complements but is different to the measure of underlying wage growth reported in the Wage Price Index." The 5.7 per cent sounds a lot more impressive than the 3.2 per cent pay rise recorded by the WPI. But you also have to remember that the population grew roughly 2 per cent last year and an even larger proportion of the population entered the labour force. If you divide the total wages and salaries payments for December 2024 and December 2023 by the estimated number of employed persons (from the separate ABS labour force survey), then you find that wages and salaries per employee rose a much more modest 2.6%, or about $173 a month. This is very much a back-of-the-envelope calculation that compares two totally different datasets from different sources — one from the ATO's single touch payroll data, the other from the ABS labour force survey — so it is by no means an accurate estimate. However, it does serve to highlight that per person pay rises were a lot smaller than that headline 5.7% number suggests. By Kate Ainsworth Some breaking news out of Adelaide from our colleague Meagan Dillon — the Whyalla steelworks has been forced into administration by the South Australian government. Changes to the Whyalla Steel Works Act were rushed through both houses of state parliament this morning, before being signed off by the SA Governor. The steelworks, which was owned by GFG Alliance until today, has been in crisis after failing to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments to the government, and millions in unpaid bills to creditors. Just days ago, GFG Chairman Sanjeev Gupta released a statement, saying the company would sell its stake in a New South Wales coal mine to repay Whyalla creditors. "This means that GFG is no longer running the Whyalla steelworks," SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said. By Emily Stewart You will have heard by now the big four banks have passed on yesterday's Reserve Bank interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points to their variable home loan rates. But what about the smaller lenders? So far, 24 banks and credit unions have passed on the cut in full. Here's the list: Source: Canstar However, the lower rate won't be applied yet. The earliest date lenders will pass on the cut to customers is 21 February, the latest date is 7 March. By Michael Janda We're getting more reaction to the wage price index data out today from the ABS. With wages up 3.2% over the year to December while consumer prices rose 2.4%, workers enjoyed an average real pay increase over the year of 0.8%. In other words, you could by 0.8% more stuff with your base pay than a year ago (the WPI doesn't include pay increases from promotions, bonuses, etc). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) says that is a bigger increase in real wages than under nine years of the previous Coalition governments. "Wages don't just go up by accident — they are the result of campaigns by union members and the Albanese government making it easier for working Australians to collectively bargain for pay rises, stopping big business wage cutting schemes and lifting the pay of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia," argued ACTU president Michele O'Neil in a statement. But Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says Australians will need to see several more years of growing real wages to catch up on the period of high inflation post-COVID. "Adjusted for inflation, Australian wages are still 6% below their peak and, based on the latest wage and inflation forecasts from the RBA, that won't improve at all in the next two years," he wrote. "It highlights just how damaging high inflation can be and how long the recovery will be." He also believes current wage increases could result in higher inflation if they are not matched by improvements in productivity. By Emily Stewart Good afternoon! Business reporter Emily Stewart jumping in here to let you know what's happening on the local sharemarket. Another lacklustre day on the markets so far, with the ASX 200 down 0.4 per cent to 8,444 points and the broader All Ordinaries down about the same amount to 8,725 points (as at 12.35pm AEDT). The worst performing sector today is financials, with NAB down as much as 8.6 per cent, after a disappointing first-quarter earning result. CBA is also in the red (perhaps because it is trading ex-dividend today). Here are the top and bottom movers so far today: By Kate Ainsworth That's the assessment of the latest wages data from Professor Fabrizio Carmignani at the University of Southern Queensland. He told finance presenter Nadia Daly on ABC News Channel that the slowing pace of wages growth is unusual to see with historically low levels of unemployment in the economy. "What we have observed over the last several quarters is a decline in the rate at which wages are growing," he said. "What we have observed is that progressive easing of labour market conditions, which is consistent with declining wage growth. "I would say that unemployment outcomes that we had for the fourth quarter of 2024 was a bit surprising in this sense, probably there was the expectation that unemployment would be a bit higher, instead it continues to be very low. "So we are indeed observing, I would say, a progressive easing of labour market conditions, although unemployment still is performing at its lowest level. "It's an interesting dynamic in the labour market, absolutely." By Michael Janda After today's decision to cut the overnight cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 3.75%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says it expects to keep cutting at future meetings. "If economic conditions continue to evolve as projected, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further through 2025," the bank's monetary policy committee said in its post-meeting press release. That's a contrast to the RBA's communications, which very much played down the extent of further rate cuts after yesterday's initial move to 4.1%. But New Zealand is arguably a bit further ahead in its battle against inflation. "Annual consumer price inflation remains near the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band," the statement notes. "Firms' inflation expectations are at target and core inflation continues to fall towards the target midpoint. "The economic outlook remains consistent with inflation remaining in the band over the medium term, giving the Committee confidence to continue lowering the OCR." But it has come at a cost. Unemployment in New Zealand is at 5.1%, even after tens of thousands of unemployed Kiwis crossed the ditch to Australia over the past year or so. The economy has basically been stuck in recession for the past 18 months, with several quarters of negative or zero growth, including a contraction over the last six months of 2024. That makes this line in the RBNZ's statement seem a piece of artful understatement. "Economic activity in New Zealand remains subdued. "With spare productive capacity, domestic inflation pressures continue to ease. Price and wage setting behaviours are adapting to a low-inflation environment. The price of imports has fallen, also contributing to lower headline inflation." But the RBNZ is hopeful of an economic revival this year. "Lower interest rates will encourage spending, although elevated global economic uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment decisions," the bank's monetary policy committee expects. "Higher prices for some of our key commodities and a lower exchange rate will increase export revenues. Employment growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the domestic economy recovers." If the RBNZ proves too optimistic, New Zealanders looking for work may be left pining for the fjords (or a plane ticket to Australia). By Michael Janda No surprises here. The RBNZ has lowered its cash rate target by 0.5 of a percentage point to 3.75%, as expected by economists and financial traders. By Michael Janda The slowdown in annual wages growth to 3.2% over the year to December was in line with forecasts the RBA published yesterday as it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The ABS wage price index was also in line with most economist forecasts. However, if you look at the RBA's November forecasts, it expected stronger wages growth of 3.4%. Go back further still to the set of forecasts before that, from August, and the RBA was expecting 3.6% wage growth for the year to December 2024. So that's a massive downward revision in the space of just six months. The RBA's economics department has a lengthy track record of consistently overestimating wages growth, including for many years prior to the pandemic. Perhaps they need to have another look at their economic models and the assumptions baked into them to find out where they are going wrong. (To be fair to the RBA, they are doing this, for example this recent research paper which draws on the experience of one of the new board members who was a Fair Work president.). My guess is that the private sector economists who believe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is somewhere closer to 4% rather than the RBA's estimate of about 4.5% may be on the money. After all, if wages growth is decelerating with unemployment at 4% and many other indicators of an apparently "tight" labour market, perhaps those levels are not really that "tight" at all? Why should we care if the RBA's models are wrong? Because if wages growth keeps coming in below forecasts — and the RBA expects a re-acceleration back to 3.4% for the year to June — then it can probably afford to cut interest rates more than it currently expects to. By Samuel Yang Shares of oil and gas producer Santos fall as much as 2.2% to $6.74, last down 2% The company posted lower-than-expected FY underlying profit of $US1.20 billion, a 16% decrease from a year ago, hurt by lower realised prices and slowing production. Stock fell 12.1% in 2024. By Michael Janda The Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its latest wage price index (WPI). And, even though unemployment is near multi-decade lows at 4%, wage growth keeps falling sharply. Base pay grew just 3.2% over the year to December, down from 3.6% over the year to September and 4.1% over the year to June. It's a very rapid deceleration. "The 0.7 per cent rise this quarter was the equal lowest growth since March quarter 2022," said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. "At 3.2 per cent, the annual increase in wages was down from 4.2 per cent in December quarter 2023 and is the equal lowest since September quarter 2022." By Samuel Yang The Australian share market has opened sharply lower, tracking losses on Wall Street. The ASX 200 index was down 85 points or 1 per cent to 8,396 by 10:27am AEDT, with financials (-2.5pc) and real estate (-1.7pc) leading the losses. Here are the top and bottom movers at open.

Title: Whale watch: Reddit stock has nearly tripled in recent months, and one major hedge fund made a $1 billion bet last quarter as it soared

A closely followed hedge fund bet big on Reddit stock last quarter. Coatue Management, a hedge fund led by former Tiger Management employee Philippe Laffont, reported a 6.5 million share stake in the social media company in its latest 13F. The filing, made with the SEC last week and as of December 31, revealed that the nearly $1.1 billion Reddit stake made up about 3.6% of Coatue's $59 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund returned 19% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's gain of about 23%. The hedge fund's recently established stake in the social media company has already proven profitable if it has held onto the shares so far this year. Based on current prices, Coatue's Reddit stake is worth about $1.2 billion, representing a year-to-date gain of $141 million, assuming the hedge fund is still holding onto the stock. While the exact price the fund paid for the stock is not known, shares of Reddit have surged 14% since in 2025 and are up 193% in the last five months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has returned 4% year-to-date. Reddit's big gains over the past few months were driven by a strong third-quarter earnings report released in late October. The company revealed a surprise profit, year-over-year revenue growth of 68%, and a 47% surge in daily active users. The stock peaked at about $228 per share on February 10 and has declined about 20% since then. Investors are still digesting Reddit's fourth-quarter earnings results from last week, which revealed a 52% surge in expenses and a traffic hiccup due to a change in Google's search engine. "We expect Reddit to continue making progress across its full-funnel diversification while delivering strong revenue growth & improved profitability," analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent note, adding that future changes to Google search are a longer-term risk. The bank rates Reddit at "Neutral" and believes it is trading at about fair value with a $185 price target. Other significant moves made by Coatue during the fourth quarter included a broad sell-off of its Chinese stock holdings and newly established positions in Charles Schwab, Affirm, Okta, and Datadog. The hedge fund's three largest holdings as of December 31 were Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: How Corporate America And Big Tech Are Forgetting About The Majority

LGBTQA+ pride flags in the Google sign to celebrate Gay Pride Month, Manhattan, New York. (Photo by: ... [+] Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When I was younger, I had a lovely older neighbor who’d graduated from Harvard as a historian at a time when there was deep antisemitism. He’d share facts and printed old newspaper articles he’d preserved over the years to remind me of the many ways that businesses of every size turned a blind eye to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and significantly profited off of it. All of this makes the head-spinning declarations of loyalty to the Trump Administration that many companies have shown in recent weeks rather curious. Businesses ranging from Google to Meta to Target who once rushed to embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “initiatives” and celebrate Black History Month have rushed to erase signs of solidarity following the Administration’s various Executive Orders. Many consumers and shareholders feel betrayed. Small businesses and startup entrepreneurs who take their cues from corporations and big tech could be impacted by this sentiment too. But, when corporate practices are unpopular there is an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should consider consumer’s values and prepare to position their companies to meet the moment and stay viable as more and more people are purchasing products from businesses that align with their principles. A new Harris poll found that four in 10 Americans have shifted spending to align with their moral views in recent months. Specifically the poll results highlighted: Further, several of Target’s shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company on January 24, after the company said it would end DEI initiatives this year, including a program to support Black-owned small businesses that it adopted following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. This betrayal shouldn’t surprise anyone who has cracked open a history book. In the 1930s Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis. IBM supplied the numeric codes tattooed on those ushered into the gas chambers. And Bayer –the aspirin company– is the reincarnation of IG Farben; a huge donor to Nazi political campaigns, a manufacturing beneficiary of Hitler’s invasions of European countries, and a shareholder in the company that produced the gas the Nazis used to exterminate millions of people. Horrifically, the Holocaust’s atrocities turned out to be a whole lot less interesting to the corporate world than how it could be used to profit their businesses. And as Succession’s Shiv Roy declared in a scene with a potential whistleblower: “We don’t get embarrassed.” Let’s run some numbers on where America is and why embracing difference and the uniqueness of people’s lived experiences matters. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s good for businesses’ bottom line too, and especially for startups and small businesses who rely on forging customer brand loyalty in their early days in crowded markets. The US Presidential election between Trump and Harris was extremely close. For votes counted through November 20th, Trump’s margin over Harris was only 1.62%, according to PBS. On a percentage basis, Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960. Another contributing factor to the election results is that voter purges have been on the rise election over election and purges historically impact people of color, especially Black voters, according to the NYT. Furthermore, the non-partisan organization League of Women Voters, as of November 6, 2024, tracked 64 anti-voter lawsuits filed in 2024 that sought to sow distrust in the election. Factor in the recent YouGov poll which found that 19 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 abandoned Harris in 2024, and one-third of those cited the war in Gaza in their decision. It was the top reason provided, beating out the economy and immigration, costing Harris more than 6 million votes. In states that swung from Biden to Trump in 2024, 20% cited Gaza in their decision to abstain from voting entirely. Bottom line: Trump did not win the election by a landslide and the majority of people in the US don’t support fascism or authoritarianism. Even current polls show Trump’s popularity with voters sitting at only 47%. People want to support politicians and businesses that align with their values. And that is exactly what many people are now doing so businesses and entrepreneurs everywhere need to stand with the majority. The widely reported mass user exodus from X to alternative startup platforms such as Bluesky has been accelerating steadily and bleeding money from X. The platform has become so alarming to several major advertisers that Elon Musk has mounted multiple lawsuits alleging boycotts. Since Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party a month ago, Tesla’s sales are tanking across Europe. In some countries like Spain, Tesla’s sales are down as much as 75% year-over-year. The stock price is also down with analysts saying that Tesla’s favorability rating is nearing all-time lows and that this could hurt near-term sales. The unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. Target’s share price took a steep hit after eliminating DEI initiatives that its own shareholders have filed a lawsuit charging it with fraud. Meanwhile, Costco’s share price is up almost 15% after refusing such rollbacks (a decision backed by 98% of voting shares). Costco also has reported a surge in memberships compared to Sam’s Club which is facing declining memberships. “It’s a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector,” noted the Harris poll. While a mass exodus from a platform like Meta could be logistically challenging –not least because the US represents such a small percentage of its user base– and such a move has yet to materialize, it would be folly to dismiss it out of hand. More and more users are questioning Meta’s commitment to fighting disinformation and online harassment. As the US TikTok ban loomed, users swarmed to Chinese alternative RedNote, signaling both an appetite and capacity for swift mass mobilization. Such a mass abandonment of Facebook or Instagram alone would have tectonic financial implications, and not just for Meta; the carnage would cascade through the millions of businesses including many small businesses that depend on its advertising model. Even the threat of such shifts could trigger investor anxiety with consequences comparable to past service outages – a 5% dip in share price, equivalent to about $47 billion in losses. Target’s shareholders have already set a precedent for how this might happen. Ultimately, what the numbers tell us is that while some of the biggest companies are lining up to abandon their DEI policies to do business with the Trump Administration, they may find themselves at odds with their customer base who have very different lived experiences and will put their money where their mouth is. This reckless lack of foresight by CEOs should alarm shareholders because it’s consumers who hold the power of the purse. And small businesses and entrepreneurs should seize this opportunity to drive their operations strategy. Because without customers their businesses will cease to exist. *Disclosure: I was previously on the Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters.
