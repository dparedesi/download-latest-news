We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said. See Also: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment. He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Restaurant stocks. While hot tech and social media stocks like Amazon and Meta Platforms continue to make new highs, there is one sector failing to keep up: restaurant stocks. Some of these names — like McDonalds — used to be considered must-owns for portfolio managers looking to outperform the averages. Judging by these price charts, those days may be over. Arcos Dorados Holdings (Nasdaq: ARCO): Arcos Dorados Holdings daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-December dropped below the mid-September support where the red-dotted line is placed. The 50-day moving average in May crossed below the 200-day moving average. The stock briefly rallied off of the late year low but remains below both of those moving averages. Arcos Dorados trades with a price-earnings ratio of 10.57 and at 3 times its book value. The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.35. This year’s earnings are off by 26%. Over the past five years, EPS shows growth of 37%. The company pays a 3.41% dividend. McDonalds (NYSE: MCD): McDonalds daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-January dipped below the 200-day moving average and has since rallied a bit, although it remains below a down-trending 50-day moving average. That dip down broke below the November low, a previous level of buying support, indicated by the red-dotted line. The company, one of the most recognized brand names in the world, has a market cap of $204 billion. It trades with a price-earnings ratio of 25. Earnings this year are off by 1.36% and up over the past five years by 8.93%. McDonald’s pays a dividend of 2.37%. Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR): Restaurant Brands International daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in early January broke below the previous support level from late May of $54. The stock has rallied off of the mid-month low of $50 and the buying volume looks strong. The 50-day moving average in early June crossed below the 200-day moving average and it’s never gone back above it. Restaurant Brands includes the franchises Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs. Market cap is $20.10 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is on the high side at 4.94. The company offers investors a 3.75% dividend. Wendy’s (Nasdaq: WEN): Wendy's daily price chart, 1 25 25. Last week’s new low takes the price well below the July low, the previous level of buying support. The stock participated in the post-election rally and then began a steady descent in value. The 50-day moving average in mid-January crossed below the 200-day moving average, a clear signal of weakness. Market capitalization is $2.91 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is a steep 15. This year’s earnings are up by 2.85%. EPS growth over the past five years is 10%. The short float of 6.56% indicates a greater interest among short sellers than the other similar brands listed here. Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM): Yum Brands daily price chart, 1 25 25. The mid-January low briefly took the price below the late July low. The stock found buyers at $122 and rallied back to just above $129. The 50-day moving average last week crossed below the 200-day moving average. Yum Brands operates more than 59,000 restaurants in over 150 countries and territories, according to the company website. Market cap is $35.79 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 23.99. Earnings this year are up by 5.87% and up over the past five years by 3.62%. Yum pays a 2.08% dividend. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com.

Title: The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia

Time Published: 2025-01-25T15:30:25Z

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. President Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence. A prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist Dubbed the “Operator”, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields. “This capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications”. OpenAI says Operator is “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you”. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations. The company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows. “Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it”. Based on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention. “AI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we’re going to see it take off”. According to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On January 23, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and raised its price target to $710 per share from $660. The firm is bullish on the company, citing its strong cost discipline and artificial intelligence capabilities. The firm said it is important for Meta (NASDAQ:META) to demonstrate a return on investment in AI, particularly in the months ahead. The analyst also highlighted how advertising revenue across platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is important for the company’s financial health and share prices. Short-term investors will be closely watching AI-driven revenue growth this year. “With a stable macro backdrop, a growing AI contribution to ad revenues, ramping messaging revenues, and continued cost discipline (recent headcount cuts), we remain positive on the stock in 2025”. Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The AI spending frenzy is just getting started
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351418/project-stargate-openai-spending-meta-microsoft
Time Published: 2025-01-25T00:15:57Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. “All I know is I’m good for my $80 billion.” Rarely does a one-liner so perfectly capture the state of the moment. Here, you have Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saying he’s “not in the details” about Stargate, the supposedly multi-hundred-billion AI infrastructure project driven by his marquee investment, OpenAI. Nadella not being read in on the nebulous details of Stargate says a lot about how much Microsoft and OpenAI have drifted apart. Microsoft is mentioned in the Stargate press release since OpenAI’s models are still exclusive to Azure. But the most striking aspect of Stargate is not that the money isn’t there for it yet; it’s that OpenAI’s biggest backer has decided to not participate in what Sam Altman is calling “the most important project of this era.” As Nadella made clear on CNBC this week, he’s running his own, $80 billion AI infrastructure buildout and, going forward, OpenAI can get additional compute — with his blessing — elsewhere. While it received fewer headlines this week, I found Nadella’s response to Elon Musk on X even more illuminating. In his response to Musk saying, “on the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money,” Nadella responded: “😂 And all this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” That post can only be interpreted as a dig at Altman. Nadella could have funded Stargate for OpenAI. He didn’t. What does he know that the rest of us don’t? The splashy Stargate unveiling at the White House certainly accomplished its goal, which was clearly getting everyone to talk about big numbers. The headlines it generated prompted Mark Zuckerberg to make sure everyone ended the week knowing his data center will be even bigger than Stargate. In a Friday post on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said that Meta’s planned 2GW data center in Louisiana “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” with a map view of the square footage overlaid on the city to send the point home. From his post (my emphasis added): “We’ll bring online ~1GW of compute in ‘25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.” I have no doubt that Altman, Masayoshi Son, and Larry Ellison will be able to raise the billions they need to lessen OpenAI’s dependence on Microsoft for compute. (The US government isn’t giving money to Stargate, which makes the optics of announcing it alongside Trump all the more bizarre.) Ultimately, this all points to the theme that is quickly coming to define 2025: Big Tech sees AI as the most existential technology of the coming era and will keep spending like hell to make sure OpenAI doesn’t completely run away with it. Few companies had as good of a 2024 as Reddit. Since going public last March, the company’s stock has soared 300 percent, giving the social network a valuation of $32 billion. It’s an about-face from where Reddit was before going public, when its moderators were raging against its hurried platform changes and there was backlash to the company selling its data to Google and OpenAI. With those controversies now seemingly in the rear-view mirror, Reddit is focused on growing its user base, staying profitable, and using AI to help people search its site more easily. I caught up with CEO Steve Huffman at CES a few weeks ago to hear his priorities for 2025, how he’s leading Reddit, his thoughts on the AI scaling debate, content moderation, and more… The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: Your IPO did very well. What have the last nine months or so been like for you personally? We have a saying at Reddit that good numbers make good meetings. So we’ve had some good meetings. Preparing to go public was intense. It’s telling the story over and over and over, which I enjoy doing, but it’s a lot of work. I think more than most new companies, we are in the public company rhythm already: close the quarter, do the audits, do the board meeting, earnings, and all of that. So it hasn’t been a major change for us from an operating point of view. It’s a really exciting time for the new investors and employees. You won’t catch us complaining. What I keep telling the company is that everyone should be very proud of the work they’ve done and don’t take these moments for granted. I just tell them, look, enjoy the view. If you look at our history, there are lots of ups and downs. No doubt there are challenges in our future. With your market cap where it is now, are you thinking of making swings you didn’t think you could make a year ago? There are two classes of things that we would do. One is to execute the core strategy. We’ve got to hire. We’ve got to build. I think we’re very reasonable in terms of our investment size. The one sentence strategy for us is to grow the product and stay profitable. What can you do with a high stock price? Maybe you can look at M&A that you wouldn’t otherwise. I’d say that’s not really our orientation right now because the acquisitions we’ve done over the last two years have been these 25-to-50-million-dollar deals. It’s kind of a sweet spot for us to get tech and teams. I’d say we’re always watching the market, but we’re not pursuing anything big or crazy right now because I like the core strategy. I think we can do what we want to do within our current capabilities. What’s the main product focus for Reddit this year? The first is the core of Reddit, which is community conversations. Everyone has a home on Reddit, but do you see that home in your first session? There’s a whole other dimension to our work, which is Reddit as an information source. Reddit has all of this incredible information. For the users who have a question that needs an answer, can we give them that answer? We just got into testing Reddit Answers. I’m finding that really helpful for searches about current events. A year from now, it’s a monetization product. It’s one of the few products where it kind of scratches every itch, so it’ll be a big focus. What do you make of this debate about whether the AI industry has run out of data? I think we’d have a different answer to that question literally every month. We want to have good relationships with other people in this space. We’re open for business. At the same time, we want to maximize the value we get out of our own data. We have not experienced conflict between the two at this point. I love the [data licensing] relationships we have — the major ones being Google and OpenAI. At this point, we don’t need to make any particular partnership. I’d say they’re all nice to have but nothing is existential for us. One of the challenges is that the AI companies don’t know what product they’re building. It’s not a bad thing. They are iterating themselves. ChatGPT itself, the central product in this conversation, was a demo. Then, a year later, it’s the most important piece of enterprise technology on Earth with questionable economics. That makes it very exciting. I don’t think any of these companies would be offended to hear me say that. You were one of the first social media CEOs I saw to be very critical of TikTok. How does a US ban affect Reddit? If you look at Reddit’s traffic graph over the last 19 years, you will not see the rise and fall of any particular platform. I think every content type should work on Reddit. Video on Reddit is largely camera-out — what I’m looking at — as opposed to camera-in, or who am I? That’s social media. I think the ban is the right thing to do for reasons I’ve mentioned that honestly have nothing to do with competition. With Meta’s moderation changes, the broader conversation around social media feels like it’s changing right now. For the last 10 years, people have been talking about whether speech is the problem, which is a crazy thought. You can’t have freedom without speech. I think that detour through questioning and relitigating core values of America, hopefully that era is coming to a close. Are people playing politics? Of course, people always are. On the topic of moderation, we always just try to do things the right way, which, not coincidentally, are aligned with American values. It’s a Democratic platform. We believe very much in the power of people and the wisdom of crowds and voting processes. That is Reddit. So I’m glad to see a return to where we have been most of my life, which is an appreciation for free speech.

Investors should not to make any major moves, he advised. "Look it's a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be," he said. "Like I always say, don't try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen." On Monday, Cramer will review earnings from SoFi and AT&T. Cramer said he expects good numbers from the fintech company, even as the stock has been heavily shorted. AT&T should also do well, he added, judging by decent results from its peer Verizon. Tuesday brings a report from General Motors. Cramer said the company is likely to deliver solid results, the stock may decline because the market is focused on Tesla when it comes to the auto industry. Starbucks also reports on Tuesday, and Cramer said he's optimistic about new CEO Brian Niccol's vision for the coffee chain. Niccol was able to transform Chipotle, and Cramer said Starbucks could be worth buying after the CEO lays out his plan. Wednesday is packed. The Fed will reveal its latest decision on interest rates. Cramer said he doesn't expect a cut when employment seems so strong. T-Mobile and ServiceNow will report their fourth quarter earnings. Cramer anticipates T-Mobile heading higher, while ServiceNow might be a buy if it dips after the release. Tech behemoths Microsoft and Meta are also reporting, and Cramer called both companies' quarters wild cards. Plus, there's Tesla earnings. Cramer noted that even when it missed last quarter, the stock still climbed, so he recommended owning it. Caterpillar reports on Thursday, and Cramer said the company has managed to lean into secular growth instead of just cyclicality. Apple also reports on Thursday. Cramer acknowledged that Wall Street is expecting a miss, but he said it's still a good stock to own long term. He believes the company will be able to fix any problems it might currently be facing. Intel is set to release earnings as well. Cramer said it needs to raise cash and fix its balance sheet before investors should own the stock. Finally, Friday has reports from Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Cramer said he doesn't want to own the oil giants because they might ramp up drilling now that President Donald Trump has relaxed federal regulations. The Labor Department will also release the personal consumption expenditures price index, an important inflation metric for the Fed, on Friday. "I think it won't be cool enough. Too much spending for that to happen," Cramer said. Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

This story incorporates reporting from Business Insider, TheStreet on MSN.com and Investor’s Business Daily on MSN.com.Analysts have updated their outlooks on Meta Platforms stock following an announcement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasizing the company’s intensified focus on artificial intelligence. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion maintained a Buy rating for Meta, holding firm on a $670 price target. Champion’s position reflects confidence in Meta’s strategic direction, emphasizing the company’s capital investments in AI technologies. The announcement underscores Meta’s ambition to position AI centrally in its growth strategy, particularly with the development of Meta AI — a virtual assistant expected to engage over a billion users. Bank of America Securities has also expressed optimism, assigning a Buy rating with a higher $710 price target. This reflects recognition of Meta’s potential for scaling AI applications within social media and digital advertising — a sector in which Meta has already established a dominant presence. Meta, previously known as Facebook, continues to explore new technologies, with AI at the forefront of these efforts. The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge. Quartz Intelligence Newsroom uses generative artificial intelligence to report on business trends. This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting.

Title: Apple enlists veteran software executive Kim Vorrath to help fix AI and Siri

Update font size. Reset Apple is enlisting a seasoned professional to tackle its AI challenges. Kim Vorrath, who has spent 36 years with the company, is moving to the AI and machine learning division. Her new role will concentrate on enhancing Siri and other AI initiatives under the supervision of AI head John Giannandrea. Vorrath has been instrumental in the development of several of Apple’s major products, from managing the initial iPhone software to supervising the operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Her most recent project involved software development for the Vision Pro spatial computing headset. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move helps bolster a team that’s racing to make Apple a leader in AI — an area where it’s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout. The Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple’s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple’s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset… The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified… It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: At this point, sigh, we’ll just wish good luck to Vorrath and review: Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposed in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Note: Apple’s (virtual, of course) 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for February 25, 2025 at 8:00 am P.T. Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024: ‎ Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Larger displays on iPhone 16 Pro models, and hundreds of millions of iPhones that are 4+ years old, will do the heavy lifting for iPhone sales and iPhone’s average selling price (ASP). Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 We are currently about 1/4th of the way to being sustainable with Substack subscriptions.

It’s obvious, Tim Cook prioritizes shareholder delight over customer delight and as long as he’s delivering on shareholder value, shareholders won’t question anything. They only care about milking Apple for what it’s worth. The Board is no different. And this is sad, actually. Apple Intelligence and Siri are utterly useless.. .Damn shame how pathetic it is.. At least 50% of the time I can’t even get “stupid ass” (SIRI) to call someone… It just glows.. Cook needs to go.. Sometimes I wonder if Rim Cock and the other Apple execs even use Siri. Do they have any idea? Can’t believe the comments here…lots of ingrates. I can only imagine…none of you know how good the emojis are? They make me a fulfilled human being. Thank you Tim. I don’t care if you’re not a product guy. Women never solve anything. This is just DEI. So Apple Intelligence was all spin, no substance after all? In my use it is better than old Siri bit not dramatically so. The things i’ve always used it for are more reliable. There are still things though that should be automatic (the age of some prominent politician for example) but still aren’t. It feels like Apple is erring on the side of extreme caution rather than risk mistakes like with the News summaries controversy. The question is whether we’ll see dramatic improvement this year. My guess yes but at the same time behind the competition. Your email address will not be published.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched a two-week winning streak despite closing lower Friday after giving up gains following a fresh intraday record high as investors digested more corporate earnings and economic data. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the S&P 500 index fell 0.3% but had earlier hit a fresh record high of 6,128.18. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 140 points, or 0.3%, while All three major averages are on track to post their second positive week, with the S&P 500 posting a record high, after President Donald Trump said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately” as he addressed world leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stock rose nearly 1% after the telecom major reported its best quarterly wireless subscriber growth in five years. American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock fell 1.4% despite the financial giant reporting a 12% jump in fourth-quarter profit, as more consumers swiped cards during the holiday season for travel and online shopping. Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 1.4% after the aircraft manufacturer said it will post a bigger-than-anticipated loss of around $4 billion in its most recent quarter, as it grappled with a prolonged strike, charges related to US government projects and expenses linked to a slew of job cuts. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) stock dropped 7.5% after the analog chipmaker forecast first-quarter profit below estimates, as it grapples with an inventory buildup in its key automotive and industrial markets. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock soared 20% after the cloud communications software maker announced that it expects adjusted earnings to come in at the top range of guidance for the fourth quarter and unveiled positive guidance for the next couple of years through 2027. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) hit a record intraday high on Friday after unveiling spending plans to invest about $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditure this year as it builds out its AI infrastructure. Intuitive Machines Inc (NASDAQ:LUNR), meanwhile, won a $2.5M contract from Nasa to advance lunar logistics handling and offloading, and surface cargo as well as mobility solutions. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, fell to 71.1 in January, down from 74.0 a month earlier, marking the decline in six months. The data comes ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, and the future path of interest rates. The US central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with Fed officials expected to largely disregard any inflationary effects stemming from tariffs under Donald Trump's administration, as such impacts are viewed as one-time price level increases rather than persistent inflationary pressures, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note. Earlier Friday, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates by 25 basis points, marking the third hike by the central bank since it began scaling back its ultra-loose monetary policy in early-2024.

Title: Meta Will Spend Record $60 Billion On AI This Year, Zuckerberg Says—After Trump Announces Stargate Deal With OpenAI

Meta will rapidly ramp up its spending in 2025 as part of its artificial intelligence push, according to its centibillionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday, as the battle between Meta and its generative AI competitors including OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI comes to the forefront this week with President Donald Trump’s announcement of the $500 billion “Stargate” joint venture with OpenAI. Mark Zuckerberg, center, at Trump's inauguration. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s Threads social media site, continuing with updates and predictions for Meta’s AI push in 2025. Perhaps Zuckerberg’s biggest revelation Friday was his guidance for $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures for Meta in 2025. That’s well above consensus analyst forecasts of $51 billion in capital expenditures this year, according to FactSet, and Zuckerberg’s median projected capex of $62.5 billion would be 63% above Meta’s $38.4 billion in projected 2024 capex and 129% above its $27.3 billion in 2023 capex. Meta will expand its “AI teams significantly” as part of its increased spending, declared Zuckerberg. The billionaire also predicted Meta’s Llama 4 large-language model “will become the leading state of the art” AI model and it will end 2025 with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the highly coveted Nvidia-designed processors powering generative AI programs including Meta AI, xAI’s Grok and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. After initially declining about 1% premarket following Zuckerberg’s announcement, shares of Meta rallied Friday, advancing as much as 1.6% shortly after market open before settling into a 0.9% gain by midmorning. Meta stock scored a record intraday share price of $646.90 and all-time high market value of more than $1.6 trillion. Meta shares are up more than 8% year-to-date. Zuckerberg’s 2025 outlook comes during a whirlwind week for generative AI after Trump capped his first full day in office announcing a $500 billion joint venture designed to build out the data center infrastructure to power OpenAI’s technology. Stargate was considered a win for OpenAI in its battle against the likes of xAI, Meta and Amazon-backed Anthropic to build out the best artificial general intelligence model, and the project highlighted a very public feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as Trump’s close ally Musk apparently undercut the president. Meta’s push beyond social media dates back to its 2021 name change from Facebook to Meta. Wall Street initially revolted at the company’s billions of dollars in advanced tech research, as Meta stock crashed 64% in 2022, before improving financial performance and a broader investor rush into all things AI bolstered the stock’s turnaround. Since Trump won a second term in November, Zuckerberg has overseen a major culture shift at his company, ending its fact checking and diversity, equity and exclusion (DEI) programs as Zuckerberg decried the company’s culture as losing its “masculine energy.” Meta remains an advertising company on paper, with 98% of revenue in its most recent quarter coming from social media ads. Zuckerberg is the fourth-richest person in the world with a $222 billion net worth, trailing only fellow American technology moguls in Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta, a stake worth about $200 billion. Meta will report financial results from 2024’s fourth quarter Wednesday afternoon. Consensus estimates call for $6.75 earnings per share and $47 billion in revenue, which would both be quarterly records. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta Will Spend Up to $65 Billion to Fuel AI Expansion, Mark Zuckerberg Says

Time Published: 2025-01-24T15:47:14Z

The Facebook and Instagram boss reveals plans to build a data center that is nearly as big as Manhattan to fuel its AI growth Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said his company will spend $60-$65 billion this year as it looks to “significantly” expand its artificial intelligence team and services. The investment comes as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is battling tech stalwarts like Google and Microsoft and upstart powerhouses like OpenAI for an upper hand in the budding AI industry. Most of Meta’s investment will go towards data centers — including one so big it would cover a large chunk of Manhattan — to fuel products like Llama, the AI model powering the company’s AI. He did not mention where that data center will be. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” He added that this “massive effort” will “bring online approximately 1 [gigawatt] of compute in ’25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million [graphic processing units].” The $60-$65 billion in capital expenditures is a major increase from 2024, when the company spent about $40 billion. Meta’s investors did not seem upset by the AI investment, at least initially, with the company’s stock price increasing 0.7% in early Friday morning trading. The company is worth $1.62 trillion. Friday’s announcement comes after Zuckerberg joined a number of other tech CEOs, including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and Tesla boss Elon Musk, at President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Zuckerberg, in his Facebook post, said AI will be a central facet of Meta’s business moving forward. “Over the coming years, [AI] will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership,” he wrote, before adding “Let’s go build!” and a flexing arm emoji.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: EssilorLuxottica stock target raised at Stifel on Meta partnership potential
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/essilorluxottica-stock-target-raised-at-stifel-on-meta-partnership-potential-3829153
Time Published: 2025-01-24T10:43:09Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- Stifel has raised its price target for EssilorLuxottica SA (EPA:ESLX) from €207 to €241, citing significant potential from its partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The collaboration, which began in 2019, has already yielded the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, a product Stifel describes as a "game changer" in the nascent smartglasses market. The latest Ray-Ban Meta model, launched in September 2023, has been the only smart glasses to achieve mass-market success. Stifel highlights several reasons for the success of Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, including their integration of connected features into the iconic Ray-Ban frame, the minimal five-gram weight increase ensuring comfort for extended use, and a highly competitive $299 (€329) price point compared to standard Wayfarer glasses. Looking ahead, the investment bank expects smartglasses to contribute significantly to EssilorLuxottica’s future growth. Sales from the segment are projected to reach €3.7 billion by 2032, accounting for 9% of total revenue and adding 90 basis points to the company’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales during 2024-2032. Profitability, which is currently dilutive, is anticipated to turn accretive by 2029 as the business scales. According to Stifel, the Meta partnership positions EssilorLuxottica at the forefront of the smart glasses revolution. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses feature improved technology, such as enhanced video recording and real-time AI capabilities. The investment bank draws a strong parallel between the emerging smart glasses market and the early days of smartwatches. “We estimate Ray-Ban Meta will have a 35% share of the smart glasses market by 2032 (versus c.70% today) with accretive profitability (vs. below average today),” Stifel analysts said. Stifel acknowledges several risks for EssilorLuxottica, including competitive threats from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which could accelerate market growth but also challenge EssilorLuxottica's dominance. Furthermore, privacy and regulatory concerns in regions like the EU, where Meta AI's functionalities are partially restricted, remain a hurdle. Despite the positive outlook, Stifel maintains its Hold rating on EssilorLuxottica, believing that much of the Meta partnership's potential is already reflected in the stock price. However, the prospect of Meta acquiring up to a 5% stake in the company could create volatility.

Investing.com -- Twilio surged sharply in premarket trading Friday after the company announced on Analyst Day that it expects adjusted earnings to come in at the top range of guidance for the fourth quarter and unveiled positive guidance for the next couple of years through 2027. Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) leaped more than 19% in the premarket trade. The company said it expects adjusted earnings for Q4 at the top end of guidance on revenue growth for Q4 of about 11%. Twilio previously said it expects adjusted EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.00 for Q4. Analysts expect Q4 EPS to come in at about $1.00, and revenue growth of 7.9%. In separate update at its investor day event, the company also unveiled its three-year framework. For 2025, the company is expecting free cash flow (FCF) in a range of $825M to $850M on 7% to 8% revenue growth year over year. Looking further ahead to 2027, Twilio is targeting an adjusted operating margin increasing between 21% and 22%, above Visible Alpha’s 19.68% consensus. The company also unveiled a $2 billion share buyback program. Following the announcement, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts lifted their price target on the stock to $144 from $118. "Twilio's Analyst Day accomplished the task for laying out the multiple levers for growth they have in the newly labeled "CXaaS" market," analysts led by Meta (NASDAQ:META) A. Marshall noted. "Raising price target as profitability commitment and prelim Q4 results were better than expected. There remain multiple levers for upside as they execute on the plan laid out," they added. Baird analysts also shared bullish comments. "We attended TWLO's investor day and driven by the pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength, came away more confident in the company's ability to continue to drive double-digit revenue growth and further upside to guidance and estimates." "We also view valuation as still reasonable, particularly given potential upside scenarios," they added, hiking the price target on the stock to $160 from $115.

Title: Apple vs. Tesla: Which Tech Giant Will Be the Better Investment in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing in stocks can take time and education to get it right and see significant returns. But even the most reliable stocks can go through surprising ups and downs based on a variety of economic factors. If you’re looking at two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, Tesla and Apple, this year and wondering which is a better investment, that question may not be as straightforward as one over the other. Trending Now: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Check Out: 4 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money Stock experts explain what makes each company valuable and offer considerations for when you invest. To understand the value of a stock beyond just its current price on the stock market, investors use a ration known as the P/E ratio, essentially the price-to-earnings ratio, according to Charles Schwab. To get this figure, you divide the price of the stock (P) by the company’s annual per-share earnings (E). So if a stock is trading at around $20 per share, and its earnings are $1, it has a P/E of 20 ($20 divided by $1). Read Next: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You So currently, Tesla’s stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of over 110, which is extremely high, according to Scott Ritchie, an investing expert at Stoculator. Tesla is a unique company because on the one hand, it’s a car company, but on another it’s also something of a tech company, depending on how you look at it. If you look at it as a car company, it’s an excellent value. Ritchie pointed out that its current market cap is $1.3 trillion, which is at least 20 times the market cap of General Motor and 30 times Ford’s market cap. “In 2024, Tesla produced 1.77 million cars, that makes it a mature car manufacturer in my opinion, and it should be valued as one. Not to mention that the 1.77 million cars is a drop in production from the 2023 1.84 million cars,” Ritchie said. If you look at it as a tech company, due to its heavy investment in AI and robotics, “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years,” Ritchie added. Compared to other tech companies with an over $1 trillion market cap like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company. On the other hand, Tesla may be doing well with its cars, but according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market. They don’t have as much money in the bank and it’s still quite a young company.” Apple is often considered a sure thing in stock, because of its dedicated consumer base and wide variety of products. However, Ritchie pointed out that Apple has seen very slow growth lately, both in sales and innovation of new products. “Last year they announced that they cancelled their decade-long electric-car project after spending $10 billion on it over the course of 10 years,” the investing expert said. “Their latest innovative product, the Apple Vision Pro, kicked off with a great debut but seem to have lost the attention soon after.” The canceled car project is likely a good thing, Ritchie said, because it could have been a “distraction” that took Apple away from what it’s good at. Overall, Ritchie added, “Apple could be a better investment than Tesla currently. It is more stable in terms of financial valuation and performance. It has a wider range of products with much less production challenges, that combined with the larger customer base makes a great profit-making formula.” Materazzi is in agreement. While Apple and Tesla are totally different companies they do share similarities. However, he said, “Apple is an extremely successful company with a long history, they have a lot of cash in the bank and their stock is often considered safe, relatively speaking among tech stocks. Apple is already a leader. Tesla is not.” The truth is, you probably can’t go wrong investing in either, or both, Materazzi said. Both stocks are part of the Magnificent 7, the big tech stocks. “Both stocks are frequently purchased by short-term speculators, even if Tesla is the original meme stock and may have a slight advantage in this,” he said. Tesla’s products may have better immediate returns, but “their products are more vulnerable in the marketplace,” Materazzi said. Apple is considered more stable but that also brings lower returns.

Trump said during a press conference Tuesday that a new company, dubbed the Stargate Project, will invest “at least” $500 billion in AI infrastructure for ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the next four years, such as data centers being built in the heart of Texas. Private-sector companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and the Japanese conglomerate Softbank are among Stargate’s initial equity investors, according to a joint press release. The company has also chosen Microsoft and Nvidia as technology partners. “This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit[s] for the entire world,” Stargate said. To be clear, Tuesday’s announcement did not specifically mention the World project, formerly known as Worldcoin (the WLD token still bears that name). Launched by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2023, the eyeball-scanning project is constructing a digital identification platform that leverages biometric data and cryptography. Still, Worldcoin’s market cap jumped past $2.2 billion Wednesday, with AI-related projects also catching a bid from traders. Among the biggest gainers was Virtuals, a protocol for tokenized AI agents that saw its VIRTUAL token increase 20% in price to $3.06. AI agents will change the internet as we know it. Bring on the future 🫡 — World (@worldcoin) January 22, 2025 Though some traders believe that AI will fuel the next crypto revolution, the so-called “meta” built around AI agents and their associated meme coins appeared imperiled just recently, as the president’s newly launched meme coin took center stage and drained liquidity from other coins. But a crypto-friendly administration that’s also cheerleading investments in AI has traders excited as AI agents show signs of taking off, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “The $500 billion could translate into investments that supercharge crypto and AI synergies, helping America become the dominant leader in these two critical technologies,” he said. The crypto trading firm Wintermute described Trump’s announcement Tuesday as “surprising,” pushing traders toward AI-related coins, such as Aixbt (AIXBT) and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), which encompasses Fetch.ai’s decentralized machine learning network. The excitement surrounding AI wasn’t limited to the cryptosphere, with Nvidia’s stock price rising 3.6% on the day to $146. Oracle’s stock was meanwhile up 6% Wednesday to $183.

Title: The State of Isekai Anime

Full Content:
If you wanted to characterize “the biggest trends in anime of the last decade,” you might be inclined to narrow in on anime's increasingly global presence or the exploding volume of new TV anime being produced. Maybe, if you follow the industry closely, you'd talk about how overseas finance has changed what anime gets made, a preference towards single cour releases, the decline of original anime not based on a pre-existing manga or novel, or the implications of home video collapsing as a pillar of anime monetization. But one trend that has been impossible to ignore, even amongst people who don't regularly watch anime, the rise of isekai. If you're entrenched in the anime fandom, it probably feels as though isekai has had a lock on the anime industry for a generation. While there have been anime that would qualify with some regularity going back to the '80s, the term only garnered widespread use in the last fifteen years, and its adoption into English-language fan spaces is even more recent. It was only last year that the loanword joined the Oxford English Dictionary, a full 14 years after “kawaii” and eight behind fellow genre-most-associated-with-anime, “mecha”. The English-language Wikipedia page on isekai is hardly older than Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Indeed, 2019 was the first year where more than 10 isekai series aired on Japanese airwaves. That would be but an auspicious allusion to what was to come. We are at peak isekai: the genre makes up 15% of 2024's new TV anime. The 34 isekai released last year may only represent a marginal 3% increase from the one prior, but over the last five, the volume of new titles with characters whisked away to another world has grown 143%. To highlight how profound that growth is: more than half of all isekai in the medium's history have been released since 2020. The most important takeaway is not necessarily the genre's dramatic increase in production, but how isekai seems to have leveled off, holding steady at around 15% of new anime produced. Viewership behavior suggests we have not hit our point of diminishing returns with the genre and that the demand side could bear even more isekai than we're getting now. The community consensus seems to be that there's already too much isekai being made, but when we discuss viewership data later, we'll explore how fan behavior doesn't reflect that notion. One may be tempted to look at this chart and see the timing of isekai's boom as correlative with the COVID-19 pandemic, to assume that part of the genre's growth is tied to increased demand for fantasy and comfort food during a time when many were isolated or locked down. While it conceptually makes sense, I'd be skeptical of the importance of lockdowns for two reasons. First, this chart largely captures the supply side of the isekai game. Anime production is a slow process, and typically takes a few years between a production committee assembling and any actual production taking place. Second, while the international anime community saw its ranks multiply during this period, isekai did not experience disproportionate growth. If anything, I'd be surprised to see fewer fans of the genre proportionately, even if the raw number of card-carrying isekai lifers has blossomed. It's true that international sales now represent a majority of revenue in the anime industry, but production plans for this quantity of isekai were already penciled in before that was the case. As for the chart methodology, what qualifies as “another world” or not depends on who you ask. For our purposes, an isekai anime is either 1) anime that has been categorized as isekai by their publishers, 2) anime that explicitly uses phrases like “isekai” or “in another world” as part of their titles and synopses, or 3) anime I judged as clear “reverse isekai” stories, where a character from another world is trapped in the real world, such as The Devil Is a Part-Timer! or Otaku Elf. I'm very much evaluating whether or not an anime embodies the spirit of isekai in the popular imagination but even if one accounts for any quibbles in definitions here, the direction laid out by the analysis holds strong. A final observation about the chart is that isekai's growth is similar to John Green's notion about falling asleep and/or falling in love: it happens slowly and then all at once. The genre's dominance was a long time coming, and one only has to look at the history of the genre in anime to see how. While much can be said about isekai in Japan, today we'll be examining the state of isekai from a primarily Western perspective, with a focus on English-speaking territories. In Japanese, isekai more literally reads as “different world” or “another world”, but the implication and common use in English is as a subgenre where the protagonist finds themselves in another world, typically one more fantastical than their own. While this concept is found in folklore from around the world, the genre's roots in popular fiction like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court lay a common groundwork for how isekai is approached today. While there are still some Western works of fiction that would reasonably be considered isekai, over the last 30 years, isekai has become a staple of anime, manga, and novels from Japan. Until recently, almost all of its growth has come from the popularity of media from that country. The mastermind behind Mobile Suit Gundam, Yoshiyuki Tomino, released the great Aura Battler Dunbine in 1983. It's considered the first isekai anime by many due to its commonalities with the genre today, despite a handful of contenders for that designation with earlier release dates, including an anime adaptation of the Wizard of Oz that hit cinemas the year prior. The 49 (thoroughly excellent) episodes of Dunbine locked in many of the tropes that would become most commonly associated with isekai going forward and served as an inspiration for many of its successors in the genre. Popular anime like The Vision of Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Digimon, and .hack//SIGN are all clear examples of “in another world” stories released in the years between Aura Battler Dunbine and the modern era of isekai. While they may have been described with the term in Japan and occasionally compared to one another, the term was not used as a category until the Japanese web novel platform Shōsetsuka ni Narō grew an audience in the late 00s in parallel with one of its more popular subjects for fanfiction, The Familiar of Zero. The excellent Kim Morrissy covered this topic quite comprehensively for ANN a few years back if you'd like to dig into the history more. It wasn't until 2012 with Sword Art Online that English-speaking netizens began using the phrase. According to SAO author Reki Kawahara in comments on Twitter (formally known as X), this is a misuse of the term, saying “SAO is set in the real world!” Sword Art Online became one of the first mega-hits of the streaming era. Accurate or not, this association immediately provided awareness to many overseas fans. To give something a name gives it power, and as is often the case with international anime audiences, having a Japanese name for the category elevated the allure even further, and made those “in the know” feel like insiders. Equipped with “isekai,” fans worldwide began to recognize the genre's relevance with ever-increasing aptitude, perhaps disproportionately so considering how rare isekai anime were during this period. And so isekai grew. Comparing the two above charts—the Google Trends journey of the word “isekai” and the release cadence of new isekai anime—reveals the impact of popular series like Overlord, Re:Zero, and KONOSUBA in the mid-2010s: there wasn't enough supply to meet demand suggested by the interest by 2017-2018. Anime most frequently takes 3-4 years between greenlight and release. It's as though you can see dozens of producers scrambling in parallel to get their company's response to Re:Zero onto the desks of animators with the way the charts dance up and to the right. Is isekai the most popular genre of anime? In a word, yes. For illustration, I've put together some analysis of all TV anime that broadcast in Japan in 2024. Popularity was determined by the same formula employed in the series of articles where I compare what's being watched in the U.S. compared to Japan expanded to also include several other countries where English is the most-spoken language: Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. By using data scraped from a dozen pirate sites, estimates for legal sites from all available data, and other proxies for viewership, after weighing each metric based on geographic distributions and a quality rating (based on Nate Silver's “pollster ratings” to prioritize metrics that have been demonstrably predictive of viewership in the past), you can make a fairly robust relative popularity scale. For the year 2024, the “top anime” of the year was a competitively ranked trio: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc, Solo Leveling, and DAN DA DAN. All other titles were rated out of 100 compared to the “big three,” if you will. If you then average out the ratings per genre, you get the following chart: What you see here is that isekai is number two…but only slightly, despite the action genre being home to all ten of the most-performant anime of 2024. While most anime fall into multiple genres in this analysis, “isekai” is wholly unrepresented in the top ten anime of the year, first showing up at the #11 spot. So, how is isekai so close to action in the ratings? Action is one of the biggest cohorts in our analysis, including nearly half of the year's TV series within its large tent. As such, it's reasonable to assume plenty of lower-quality action series dragging down the average, and you'd be right to. However, the biggest determinant of isekai's success is its consistency. I could make a lot of sports analogies for isekai here, but I'm going to do it in a way that makes sense to me: through the film Moneyball. It's based on the somewhat true story of a baseball general manager who employs quantitative analysis to transform the sport into a giant optimization problem, allowing the (then) Oakland-based Athletics to hire a roster of players who drastically overperform relative to their price and move up in the league's standings. While it's overly simplified for the movie (and arguably, overstated), the key metric the A's team seeks is a player's ability to first base. The heart of the concept is that if you can just get more players on-base, on average, you'll end up with more runs than a team with a lower on-base percentage. And that's what isekai does; it gets on-base. When we analyze anime ratings, we split them into four equal groups called quartiles. The light blue bar shows the middle two quartiles, representing the popularity of the median 50% of each genre. Looking at these ranges, isekai is far ahead, with the highest first and third quartile. Even the comparatively weak isekai—those at the 25th percentile—are comparable to the average performance from nearly every other genre. This is also to say that close to 75% of isekai are more popular than the average comedy or romance. This is the real value of isekai: it's hard to make a flop in another world. Anime distributors and publishers tend to use letter grades to denote the “level” of an anime, usually in terms of its revenue potential. As such, for an anime to be graded an “S” means it's anticipated to be an all-timer, in the top 5-10% of all series, an anime that will generate huge streaming audiences and many secondary streams of income. Isekai may be a reliable hitmaker, but it has a really hard time breaking into the “S” category. When you looked at the chart above, the first thing you may have noticed was, on a 100-point scale, how low the average anime was. The average “popularity score” for all 2024 TV anime was 10.1, with the median sitting just over a value of 5. The trio of top titles mentioned had just as much estimated viewership and interest in them as the bottom 120 combined. This kind of “feast or famine” distribution is fairly normal in media, but that doesn't make it any less hard as a consumer to conceptualize how big the gap is between a Solo Leveling and a Girls Band Cry is, particularly when they sit side-by-side on Crunchyroll and are discussed at similar rates on social media. As mentioned above, the top isekai anime of the year sits at rank #11 for the year: Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation. But with a popularity rating of just 33% that of Demon Slayer, is it fair to call it an “S”-level title? It's watched by a ton of people, yes, but is that all it takes to make an Attack on Titan-level hit? In English-speaking countries, it's not a top-seller for home video. The light novels haven't made the BookScan charts. The anime's licensee Crunchyroll isn't selling much branded apparel (though sublicense Ripple Junction has a dozen SKUs currently active), nor have there been any collaborations for other categories of licensed merchandise. This is the case for most isekai titles. Popular ones like Re:Zero and KONOSUBA fare a bit better in the specific verticals mentioned above, but generally speaking, isekai anime are less likely to see their rights exploited outside of streaming compared to similarly viewed shows. The factors behind this “always the bridesmaid, never the bride” situation can best be examined by understanding exactly who is watching isekai. What kind of person watches isekai? To answer this question, the best place to go is to the people who watch isekai. As part of White Box Entertainment's research for publishers, my team and I regularly survey self-identified anime fans in select English-speaking countries (the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa), and that gives us a good place to start looking at what the demographics and behaviors of this group are compared to anime fans at large: Considering a large percentage of the anime community watches isekai, it's impressive that this profile tells you anything about isekai fans, but the trends align with observed fan behavior to highlight key differences. Isekai fans, in short, watch more anime and have been watching anime for longer. There are slightly more males than the fandom at large, but only slightly (English-speaking countries are the only territories with a noticeable gender gap in viewership). Non-binary fans are proportionately less likely to watch isekai. We see parallels between merchandise and fandom activities: isekai fans are 22% less likely to listen to anime soundtracks or purchase any anime merchandise. There are many challenges with this kind of analysis, though. First, it's self-reported. People who fill out surveys have the distinct characteristic of being willing to fill out surveys, and while my team and I work hard to address that, it's a limitation for sure. Secondly, we can only be so thorough. For many traits, interests, and behaviors, isekai fans were essentially the same as the audience at large. One of those that was particularly interesting to me was the stated propensity to discuss anime online on social media: people watching at least a single isekai anime this season as well as self-identified isekai fans alike both said they discussed anime on social on the regular — at a higher rate than the broader survey sample! This stood out because, in my research, isekai is the genre with the lowest social media volume in English, particularly compared to viewership. Again, as with merchandise, there are certainly outliers, but one would hardly know The Most Notorious "Talker" Runs the World's Greatest Clan is one of the most-watched anime of the Fall in the US by browsing BlueSky, nor is it represented as well as similarly-viewed series in the English fanfiction, fanart, or cosplay spaces. The takeaway? People love to watch isekai, but when they engage in fandom activities, they're more likely to engage regarding a different anime they're keeping up with. The depth of their interest in isekai runs a bit more shallow. However, there's another complicating factor that plays a role in the decreased interest in fandom surrounding isekai anime: the backlash towards the genre in the community. You don't have to spend much time talking with anime fans to hear complaints about the volume of “isekai slop” and it's hard to blame long-time viewers in particular for their perspective: the quantity of new isekai hitting Japanese airwaves in any given week since 2022 is around the same number as the entire late-night anime roster combined as recently as 15 years ago. It begs the question, should isekai take up 15% of the TV anime scene? It's been almost two years since Steve Jones & Nicholas Dupree wrote “we've truly reached the bottom of the barrel” regarding isekai. It's been five years since Geoff Thew released a video called “Too Much Isekai” — and that was during a year with less than half of 2024's volume! These are far from the only content creators and editorial teams to feel this way, and it's reflected in the fandoms across political borders and languages. As we discussed earlier, isekai draws in viewers with a consistency not even “shonen action” can compete with. And compared to other forms of visual media with similar audience sizes, anime is extremely cheap to produce. If we wanted to make a perfectly economically efficient distribution for what the anime industry as a whole should produce, we would need more isekai, at least until its middle 50% of titles stopped performing so far above other genres. That said, not all popularity is equal. We're talking about art here, and there's a reason that so many of us have moments from anime first encountered decades ago that still resonate with us now. This emotional impact has business ramifications as well. Anime that can affect a broader audience has a broader reach, something that's of particular interest to the biggest purveyors of the medium in the Western world like Crunchyroll and Netflix. The challenging thing is trying to measure the qualitative reaction to anime. We've already explored how isekai anime, while generally strong performers are rarely considered “anime of the year” material by viewership. The same behavior is seen in the eyes of critics and fans. Since its inception in 2017, only two isekai have been nominated for the Crunchyroll Anime Award's top category, Re:Zero and Sonny Boy, the latter of which wholly ignores most conventions and tropes popular in the genre. Isekai is nowhere to be found in Anime News Network's Best Anime of 2024 list, and to find a representative of another world in the annual AOTY mega-poll results from ANN's readers, you'd have to go back to 2021. Whether it's on MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, or IMdB, isekai ratings are virtually indistinguishable from other genres on average. I typically don't put stock in these sorts of user ratings, but isekai anime tends not to get enough critical reception to make it onto the likes of similarly misleading aggregators like Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes that are used as barometer of reception in polite company. As a result, I took the time to crank out MyAnimeList's ratings for isekai compared to other genres since the spike in 2019. The results can be found here: To start a list of important qualifications, according to my survey data and SimilarWeb, MyAnimeList skews male significantly more than most other anime websites. This is compounded by the fact that the users most likely to leave a rating are even more male and younger. People who use MyAnimeList are more likely to be deeply enfranchised compared to the anime audience as a whole. Additionally, most people will not leave a review for an anime they have no interest in even starting, and isekai are typically loud and obvious as to their nature, thus removing those who find them unpleasant as a rule from even giving them enough of a chance to leave a “3/10 dropped” from the calculation entirely. You can understand with all these issues with the data—as well as the novel's worth more I'm holding back for everyone's sake—that I don't take any platform's user ratings all too seriously in evaluating reception, even one as popular as MAL. That said, once we take this chart with a bucket of sand, the trend we saw with popularity is represented once again: isekai is generally received fairly well. Titles like Re:Zero and Mushoku Tensei have demonstrated that the genre's best are evaluated by the anime community without their genre being held against them, and titles like Sonny Boy and Ascendance of a Bookworm represent isekai's ability to cater to a more critically-inclined crowd. Breaking out the subgenres within isekai reveals how much the “cheat” sub-category drags down the rest. As you'll see from the analysis, I think there's a great case for cheat isekai's importance, but it's not as easily defined as something like a “reincarnation” isekai. A cheat isekai, to me, is a series where the protagonist has a disproportionate power-level advantage beyond the skills or knowledge they bring from another world. One of the loudest critiques of isekai characterizes the genre as power fantasies for those dissatisfied with their station, replete with wish fulfillment of every flavor. I find this to be a bit too broad of a brush, even when centering on the “cheat” subgenre that most closely aligns with the stereotype. But cheat isekai only represent 11% of the genre's output in recent years, and, perhaps more importantly in understanding why they're so visible, they're amongst the most watched. Using the same methodology for 2024 anime as above for the sub-genres, we find the average popularity of isekai TV anime as follows: This one requires a caveat as well if a smaller one. Many of these sub-genres or genre cross-overs are quite small; “villainess,” “slice of life,” and “transformation” are only represented by a pair of titles each for 2024. These trends are consistent enough over the years but as with the above chart, I'd encourage you to not treat it as gospel. That said, sub-genre performance only further demonstrates the power of isekai. All but two of isekai's particular classifications beat out drama, romance, and sports anime on average, and isekai crossover genres outperform equivalent non-isekai categories as well. For example, slice of life that's also isekai are 55% more popular on average than your standard iyashikei. I would not have anticipated romance as a category that benefits from a cross-genre with isekai, but the data show just that. You may also notice another trend comparing the two charts about isekai's subgenres, one that's represented across all media: critical evaluations seem to be negatively correlated with popularity. That is to say, the most popular isekai subgenres are the least well-regarded, and the most positively reviewed don't necessarily see much in the way of viewership. Such is the way it goes! Even though “reincarnation” is a consistent winner with viewers, since it represents such a significant share of all isekai, it's hard to parse out anything meaningful about whether the reincarnation element is an important quality to either viewers or critics. Transformation anime performs quite well, but much of this can be attributed to how strict I was in my definition. For classifying subgenres, I tried my best to aggregate tags and metadata across multiple platforms, but in the end, I had to rely on my own experience with these titles. For "transformation" I felt the category was compelling enough to crunch the numbers on, as many consider it a core element to many anime in the genre. However, “transformation” is a bit too broad of a topic. If we're to get metaphysical, almost any isekai contains a transformation of the protagonist(s), especially those involving reincarnation. In the end, after a strenuous debate with other isekai experts, I landed on the concept that an anime where the protagonist is no longer human would be the deciding line. Anything less drastic would lead to too many case-by-case subjective considerations and would, like with reincarnation, muddy the results. Thus, for 2024, the success of transformation isekai was all but certain. It's mostly due to two heavy-hitting franchises that have had regular seasons: That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and Overlord. Aside from “cheat” isekai, most subgenres have grown at the same rate as isekai, their proportion of new anime produced staying more or less flat year-to-year. One subgenre where there's been a slight uptick in production as well as cause for extra attention is villainess isekai. While the title “otome isekai” is perhaps both more accurate and is used by many of the subgenre's most ardent adherents, it's known colloquially as “villainess” due to both the term's ubiquity in titles and its resonance with English-speaking audiences. Otome games are visual novels or otherwise story-driven games with a female target audience that focus on romance, often with a reverse-harem framing or opportunities to enjoy handsome gentlemen interacting with one another. In many, a villainess character is prominent: she is your primary adversary, your rival in love. And for many isekai anime aimed at the otome game audience, our protagonist finds themselves in the role not of the hero, but of the villainess! The subgenre's most well-known example is 2019's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, wherein the protagonist is magically trapped in the world of her favorite otome game in the villainess role. Besides being quite popular with its intended audience, My Next Life as a Villainess was something of a crossover hit, and became one of the year's more popular new titles, receiving not only a second season, but a film as well. Relative to other anime of similar popularity, isekai franchises tend to get fewer theatrical excursions than their contemporaries, so the fact that Catarina Claes's exploits made it to the big screen before Ains Ooal Gown is particularly notable. In the years since, there have been a handful of anime adaptations with similar concepts. Where this trend is even more noticeable in the world of Japanese web novels and light novels from which almost all isekai anime are adapted. Like isekai itself, villainess anime in the six years since My Next Life as a Villainess has performed consistently in both the West and in their native Japan, making the category attractive for producers looking to minimize risk. Already, we have anime adaptations for The Old Man Reincarnated As A Villainess, The Holy Grail of Eris, and The Dark History of the Reincarnated Villainess planned for this year or soon thereafter, but that's only considering anime based on Japanese works. South Korean manhwa/webcomics have had some of their biggest successes in the world of isekai, with villainess titles taking a more central position on trending lists on webtoon sites than their contemporaries in manga and Japanese light novels. With the increased interest in South Korean comics as source material for anime in recent years, including the mega-popular Solo Leveling and, in particular, the villainess isekai Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke's Mansion, I believe we'll see the continued growth of otome-styled isekai anime in the years ahead. The volume of new TV isekai seems to be in a steady state, if not growing ever slightly. It's one of anime's most popular genres and has become an iconic one, representative of many of everything the medium can offer. Like their Japanese counterparts, international audiences seem incredibly receptive to watching the majority of the isekai series released, even if they're not as keen on building a fandom around them. Similarly to the anime that adapt them, isekai manga and light novels may not be at the top of the charts, but many franchises are solid perennial sellers. Digging into sales numbers from Oricon, it's rare to see an isekai franchise in any manga top 10, but for everything concerning light novels, the genre is ever-present. I haven't seen any meta trends either in Japan or overseas that there's any kind of shift away from isekai in readership, and I see no reason to doubt that the supply of source material for more anime can sustain the current rate of adaptations. Which brings us to the future. As The New York Times reported last year, nearly every anime studio was booked for years out, and that issue hasn't changed since. The anime currently in production or penciled in with studios aren't necessarily locked in, but shifting what's already queued works against the risk-averse philosophies of most publishers. Earlier, I noted how the “sudden” spike in anime production was essentially on a 3 to 4-year delay from when the genre started to deliver outsized results around the globe. Similarly, we'd need to see a significant downside in the financials related to producing isekai anime for the trend to reverse, and even then, there'd be a years-long gap to be meaningfully felt. To be clear, the opposite is happening. Isekai is a low-risk, high-reward genre for anime producers, just as much now during peak isekai as it ever was. Even a poorly performing isekai delivers outsized results compared to any other genre, almost as if the label is a “one weird trick” for producers. It was a technique that likely brought about WarnerMedia's Suicide Squad ISEKAI, an anime with a conceit that was so compelling that it spent 16 days on Max's top 10 in the United States last year, suggesting viewership in the millions in America alone. Isekai is not just continuing to get produced at incredible rates: it's getting preferential treatment in 2025. Crunchyroll typically dubs 15-20 simulcasts in a season, but with more than double that in terms of new anime, Big Orange needs to prioritize. Tellingly, nearly every isekai premiering this month is on the list of Q1 dubs, with isekai representing more than 40% of Crunchyroll's dub output. For 2025 and into the future, isekai is a core part of the popular conception of anime. While I don't think we'll see an isekai reach the level of mega-hits like Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, the anime industry can hardly be faulted for investing so heavily in the genre when it's continued to find such consistent success with little indication of flagging. Isekai seems resilient to negative sentiment in the community, and audiences have shown a consistent interest in new IP based on the genre alone. The state of isekai is strong, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Feature homepage / archives

But a stray thought popped up in my mind. Trump wants to take an axe to the Federal government, right? So I wondered if Trump was thinking about privatizing the CDC, the FDA and the NIH in his second term. I’m sure that the health care corporations would like to buy them up and run them the way that they should be. Don’t they already recieve more than 50 percent of their budgets from private companies? Seems like that would be more honest On the other hand, those government labs spend billions to develop new drugs which are then handed over to Big Pharma corporations who work out the dosage and then slap their patent on it. Can you imagine if it was the US government slapping their own patents on those new drugs and funneling back the profits for new research? I can! This is the US government shutting down public access to public information. Expect anything unfiltered that’s related to energy, climate, environment, health, to go dark soon, along with any potentially embarrassing open-ended data services like FRED. Privatization comes later, once DOGE is up and running. If you have any favorite public data sets, download them now. We’re going to need them. As a physician, I have been used to looking at these datasets for decades. Reports, MMWR, etc. At no time in our history until the Biden Admin was there suppression of data. The Biden Administration literally seemed to live to do that. Even during the dark days of the AIDS epidemic, there was no restriction in the free flow of information. Please note, it took months to compile – so there was quite a delay and that is understandable and that is not what I am talking about. The free flow of information continued through COVID during the Trump years. And then once the vaccines came out and there started to be “issues, the adults that were put back in charge with Biden – suddenly caused all kinds of data flows to come to an end. The US govt did shut down public access to health information – this was started under Biden – and I have never seen anything like it in my life. As to downloading public data sets, hope you are looking for something anodyne and non-problematic. All of the other stuff is long gone – and when you do download something – it is not really anything that you can use to make any kind of judgements. As I have stated from the being – release every scrap of raw data down to the finest details – just like we have done for a long time. No one is listening. My wife and I were discussing decreasing access to data (again) this morning. Pretty glum about the current state of affairs. Trying to find some glimmer of hope, I would hope RFK jr understands the value of having data in the public domain. My worry is that, in addition to being damning to Pfizer in that specific case, generally speaking, public health data has monetary value. There’s a fog of war element to these opening days of the 47th. The state data on SARS infections went dark in the west coast states in May of 2023. The governors of WA, OR, and CA marched in lockstep during the early pandemic. I don’t know if it’s my inexperience with the system, but I have not been able to find overall mortality data for the US 2015-2019 plus 2020 on from the CDC site. I’d like to make my own excess analysis. On the other hand, this certainly doesn’t help the situation any, either. Like with other issues, Trump is doing the same thing as the Democrats, only louder. This kind of situation is what makes me believe the binary political parties are no solution for the problems we face. Looks like the Chinese are doing AI right. How much longer before BRICS nations figure out that copyright law keeps people from using personal computers like Star Trek replicators? It’s past time to legally and Constitutionally clarify the legality of making digital copies. Western capitalism has failed in every respect, giving BRICS an easy way to blow up Hollywood™©®’s absurdly punitive civil damages laws. Never forget that Congress passed a law allowing music downloaders to be sued for up to $20,000US per song or about a quarter of a million dollars per record album. The vast majority of new music is created, edited and released on equipment that costs well under $20,000. How does this make sense? Copyright is governed on the country-by-country basis. Length in majority of countries is 50 years and in many of them civil damages are negligible to a point where there is zero enforcement. Insane penalties and over-the-top enforcement are mostly restricted to US, Canada and Europe, mostly due to trade treaties signed with US. Insane copyright protection was one of the pillars of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and was one of the reasons it failed. Sorry but that’s not correct. Copyright is governed under the Berne and Rome Conventions and the WIPO copyright treaty. Member countries transpose the treaties into their law, but agree to respect minimum protection. Most all countries are members. The term is usually either 50 or 70 years plus the life of the author. I started my legal career in IP and I’d recommend that you read a little more about it if you’re interested. It’s a fascinating subject and there are lots and lots of arguments about length, fair use, right to private copies, moral rights, neighboring rights (my old specialty, dear to my heart) and other somewhat arcane stuff. Imho, artists, composers and authors deserve some legal monopoly over their works for a limited period of time. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. I’m done. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. When I read this I stood up and applauded, tears running down my cheeks. Thanks. It’s my passionate belief as well. Can you believe that Microsoft Windows 3.0, released in 1990, will only be in the public domain in 2085? (95 years after published date for works for hire) Being a legal non-expert: This issue is of paramount importance nobody addresses adequately in public. As I see it, copyright only is an inadequate remedy in a capitalist system. Besides personal vanity for most artists and inventors IP regulation is (was) a means to make a living. If state services were free, apartments free, basic income guaranteed and all the other idealist concepts were to be realized (not in our lifetime) copyright would need not be. “Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants” for me always meant that the giants themselves were consisting of dwarfs. Meaning we all are dwarfs. Which would sum up the creation and expansion of human knowledge and creative output over millennia. “Piracy the obvious choice” is the thing Cory Doctorow used to talk about before deciding to be social activist. If we want to go to war over our IP with what kind of aircraft carrier will we defend it? A trade war with China may mean they will once again revert to copying, er, pirating all our movies and software. And in the process they are developing the skills to not need our IP. It’s likely that when it comes to both China and Russia Trump doesn’t really realize what he is dealing with. US soft power is evaporating leaving only the hopefully empty military threats. DJT needs to stick to picking on Greenland. Or maybe he does realize all this and is just posturing. And it’s not like his predecessor seemed to realize either. Interesting times. He still does. I think it’s been previously linked here, but that was the gist of his recent rant re Trump’s tarrif threat. https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham Makes sense, it’s the kind of asymmetric warfare that would quickly sharpen C-suite attention south of the border, much more than retaliatory tariffs, which only increase profits along with consumer prices. To bad our oligarchy is in bed with their oligarchy and it’ll never happen. I definitely like it. “Piracy, the obvious choice” These are a very important series of comments: important for development countries but critically important for the developing. Important for understand equity in all countries. When I was in Hanoi, Vietnam a couple of years ago there were motorcycles everywhere and I thought the Japanese were dominant even with expensive cycles. Finally, I noticed that I was not seeing so many Hondas but “Honkas.” Honkas—love it There is not a lot of data on this topic, but outside the u.s. and europe most university students rely on piracy to acquire textbooks. Ironically, this means that they have access to a much broader selection of books than their 1st world counterparts. My US college student does that too, please. I told her it ain’t what you steal, but who you steal it from My Canadian university students get their textbooks from “Uncle Vlad”. Soft power at its most powerful… Just look at Elsevier which is a rip-off of epic proportions. On the other hand in German university libraries where non-staff can have easy access too De Gruyter e.g. offers most studies as open access. >Trump announces an up to $500 billion AI infrastructure investment involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Business Insider OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son attended the White House announcement. Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? Larry Ellison, would that be the pro-Israel zionist who donated $17M to IDF recently? My Twitter feed is lite up with people who were very dubious of the rushed mRNA technology used for CV19 chiming in on what a Trump sell-out this is. David Icke is actually starting to make sense to some, these oligarchs are reptiles, reptilian at the very least. Going from transgender to transhuman? 500 Billion dollars, that would go a long way to help some desperate people drowning under pile of hospital bill debts, local clinics, etc… that would go a long way to ease the servitude of millions of young people struggling to make monthly payments on student loans. It’s also very interesting that this is being sold as a personalized openAI solution for fighting cancer. No wonder all those tech billionaries who loathed Trump, where sitting all together during inauguration smiling. Also, didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer and would be making it available for free? Sounds very similar. Stargate, StarLink, twinkle, twinkle little star, I’m not going where you are… https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/russia-vaccine-cancer-9744034/ Zaganostra: … didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer [1] There is not and cannot be one single mRNA vaccine for the many, many different types of tumors that develop in all the different cell-types throughout the human body, as far as I know. The whole point of such vaccines is the targeting specificity they’d provide. And yes, each vaccine would be personalized — that’s the point of them. [2] Nor is there anything new about mRNA vaccines for cancer, or anyway the concept. Moderna was originally founded in 2010-2014 specifically to develop such vaccines, and got repurposed when COVID-19 appeared. <Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? “Derrick Broze speaks to Poornima Rao, the mother of Suchir Balaji, the OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead on November 26, 2024.

No wonder it brings smiles to faces of billionaries. “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” ‘From all the Europeans? 200,000, it’s a minimum. It’s a minimum, otherwise it’s nothing’ He’s talking about NATO troops of course but 200,000? Wouldn’t that be like all the available troops that NATO has? Check out this page on the number of active military personnel in NATO countries in 2024- https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/ The 5th largest contingent is the UK at 184,860 but that is like the entire UK military as in all of them. How many can the British Army send to the Ukraine then? I would guesstimate about 10,000 people – maybe. You start going through the numbers for each country on that basis and it does not add up to 200,000 people. The only way that it does is by having troops come from that country to the north of the Gulf of America which is what Zelensky is really talking about. But there would be a side “benefit” to having so many peacekeepers in the Ukraine. This Ukrainian guy was saying that they had lost so many men that the country is going to be a demographic disaster. Unless of course you had say 200,000 lonely men on duty in that country that could hook up with all those widows and single women and then problem solved. It made a bizarre sort of sense but more likely those women would use those soldiers as a ticket out of the country to one that is much safer. The Danish F 16 instructor allegedly killed in Ukraine by a Russian missile strike, had supposedly been ‘entertained’ by a Ukrainian woman who subsequently gave his whereabouts away to the Russians. Of course, the story has been denied by Danish authorities, but I did see a tweet in Danish by a guy claiming to know the instructor and that he was dead. Who knows in the Fogh (sic) of war. So maybe these widows and single women could also use them as a ticket to safety in Russia. I’m contractually obliged to report that I have just posted an essay on the idea of a “peacekeeping” force in Ukraine, and related issues. Since any European peacekeepers are by definition NATO soldiers, you think that they would go with the idea of Chinese peacekeepers? To your numbers, Rev, In believe that to deploy 200.000 “peacekeepers” in Ukraine, all in all, 600.000 troops should have to be mobilised accounting for the required rotations. “Entertainers” would be needed a lot, not only in Ukraine, but in nearby reserve places. Romania, Poland? Oh my, you are quite correct. Through rotations you would need your figure of 600,000 troops to be on tap. Can’t be done. I don’t think they would be interested and, as I’ve made clear, the Chinese don’t have the capability for force projection at that distance, let alone to Holland others/ Given that Ukraine cannot win, and that NATO cannot deliver enough people to be killed, it does seem like the real source of manpower would have to be “that country to the north of the Gulf of America” except that Zelensky must also know it’s never gonna happen. So this begins to look more like a desperate attempt to simply keep the gravy train war going. The Ukraine side of this conflict is beginning to remind me of that old Star Trek episode A Taste of Armageddon, in which two planets are fighting a centuries-long war entirely using computers, except that to keep score for the computers, their citizens were obliged to report to “disintegration chambers” in which they would be killed. The Enterprise crew gets caught in the crossfire, so to speak, are captured and being pushed to die in said disintegration chambers, basically in order to keep the “normalized” computer war going and thereby avoid a “real” war. Some eerie parallels here, as the larger narrative is that NATO+US should perform some “duty” to die in the Ukraine (instead of Ukrainian soldiers, to avoid demographic disaster you know), in order to somehow prevail and prevent a larger more “real” war with Russia. It’s just bonkers. I am Nomad …speaking for all Americans So that’s where you deport all those illegals too? I expect that my slow the flow at the border… Bonkers, yes. Trump may seem ridiculous with his Gulf of America but it’s a harmless bonkers so far. That other bonkers is proving horribly deadly. Why is Gulf of America bonkers? To the north of it is North America, to the south of it is South America and it’s also surrounded by Central America and Latin America. Gulf of America seems pretty harmless while not being an actual overreach. Of course when I first heard the idea I was outraged… But then after sleep I saw the sense of it, and the harmlessness. Throw the US a bone, I say As a map person I’m not particularly in favor of presidents renaming stuff. But of course the Dems have been doing it too. There has been some commentary that all the legally dubious outside the box moves by the Dems are going to come back at them from their supposed opponents. Our entire ruling class may have way too much time on their hands. I don’t know about that. Acquiesce quietly to the Gulf of America in order to avoid a stupid and pointless fight and I fear that the next thing you know they’ll be demanding that the Pacific and the Atlantic be renamed as the Oceans of America East & West. How about Gulf of the Americas or if we really want to rub it in we could call it, in honor of our declaration of hemispheric hegemonism, the Gulf of Monroe Or just Marilyn… The Gulf of Mexico was named by Spanish explorers in the 16th Century. They claimed much of the adjacent coastline for Spain. In fact, Spain claimed much of what became Mexico and (Alta California); until the Mexican revolution in 1821. Much of the northern portions of Mexico were invaded by the US Army in 1846 and made Territory’s of the US;later became the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California (Baja excepted). So, since most of the Gulf coastline is adjacent to Mexico and Cuba, the name is appropriate. Throw the US a hand granade, I say I’ve proposed that just the Dead Zone be renamed Gulf of America. I don’t believe that Trump has any authority to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Those are international waters. He may as well try renaming the Barents Sea. What he is trying to do is far from harmless. It is imperial overreach at its very worst. Cartographers should tell Trump to take a hike – down the Orient Express on Denali. Put them in Poland! BTW Zelinskyy is as legitimate a “leader” as any of the puppets US put in Saigon. during that long ago quagmire “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” And I want a pony Since this talk of 200,000 peace keepers is a steaming heap of horse manure, dig in. There has to be a pony in there. Early 1945 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Early 2025 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Once again the 4th turning shows up~ I believe most, if not all, African states have taken a neutral position on the Russo-Borderlands war so presumably the ideal peacekeeping force will consist of 200,000 troops from sub-Saharan Africa. They’ll just love the winters. Is there any official list or source with the real number of troops. Just as you describe it for GB? Out of those 184,860 90% would be dead immediately in case of real war. It’s the well-known NATO paper tiger. But people ask me where do you take your numbers from. Of course, how do you prove that NATO troops are not fit for combat if there is no war. How do you prove the negative? That’s a hard sell in any debate. And that will take off now all over EU. p.s. Of course you can reference the US studies like in Parameter Magazine but that is American and very specific. And you can now prove that NATO tanks are firecrackers but that too needed over a year of negative news slipping through. Additionally to the pre-existing scattered reports about Leopards failing in Syria and Kurdistan which were buried very very deep. >Guillotine Watch It’s going to be very interesting to see if a Nation/regime that attempted to purge billionaire oligarchs from having control over public/foreign policy (Russia/Putin) will trump a Nation/regime that hands over public/foreign policy to them (Trump/Elon, et al). Yes, the China gambit of AI as a public utility is interesting in this regard. To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage from not drowning their productive class in rents. To actually be competitive, Trump should be thinking about the propensity of Chinese billionaires to fall off cliffs and that sort of thing. Instead, he appears to be becoming the “Grifter in Chief”. jsn: To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage Exactly so. You point out what will likely be one of the — maybe the — dominant geopolitical trends of the next few decades. At least if we’re fortunate. So, the CIA will be using AI trained on massive amounts of propaganda to predict the behavior of world leaders. That should go well: “PutinBot, what are your plans for the next few years?” “Well, I plan to eat a bunch of babies, then re-take Alaska. Then, I’ll either die of cancer or poison Ameirica’s water supply to sap and impunity all of their precious bodily fluids; I don’t know which.” You think that the CIA built themselves a TrumpBot to try to predict his actions if he was re-elected as President? Good luck with that one. But this article did finish on a bizarre note. So the CIA is going to bring in Silicon Valley to help drive their culture. Really? Sure they have been joined at the hip since the early days but is the CIA ready for that level of ruthlessness and urge for world dominance? The first thing that comes to mind re what SV has that the CIA doesn’t is massive, obscene payoffs for the winners of the greasy pole competition, so maybe they have a point? Not a good one, but in this timeline it almost makes a perverted sense. Don’t forget that he (Putin), is going to corner the market of washing machines so they have a guaranteed supply of chips for missiles. “PutinBot, can you tell me how effective American sanctions are against Russia?” “PutinBot, can you tell me in step-wise detail how Americans can win in the Ukraine?” “PutinBot, can you tell me where i can find 200,000 able-bodied men to die in Ukraine?” Ding Ding! You win the internet today. “India Set to Take Back 18,000 Citizens From US to Placate Trump” India is not worried by this development at all. As soon as those 18,000 Indians are back home, the Indian government will have them apply for H-1B visas and before you know it, they will be back again but legally this time. And they know that Vivek will always have their back. Re: WHO to lose 1/5 of its budget. Good. No more US influence. I know. Queen Ursula probably still has a contract with Pfizer. Eh, the B & M Gates Foundation can probably pick up the slack. / ;) I suspect that the B&M Gates Foundation is already busy “picking up” the pace of the Jackpot. WHO soon to be World Helots Organization? court rejected the complaint against her re: Pfizer sms I understand that as the US has already paid their dues, that they will still be in the WHO for this year. Meryl Nass has followed all the issues around the WHO, the treaty, etc. very closely. Here’s her rundown on the issues as they stand. MSM is full of errors about the WHO withdrawal, so I will correct them. https://merylnass.substack.com/p/msm-is-full-of-errors-about-the-who (The MSM is full of errors? Can it be? / ;) Thanks. I did not follow the MPox outbreaks carefully at the time. Is Nass’s point #8 correct? The WHO should not be managing international outbreaks, after its well-publicized delays and failures with the 2 largest Ebola epidemics in Africa, and what I would call its ridiculous performance over monkeypox, twice declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. What we need to get rid of is politicized healthcare, and the WHO represents all that is wrong with centralized medical decision making. I am not sure that there are not mistakes in the Nass piece. There is no mention I have found in the WHO Constitution of countries having a right to leave the organisation. IIRC when Warsaw Pact countries sent in their resignations in the 1950s they were not accepted. There may have been resolutions in the US Congress that the US should give a year’s notice if it wished to leave the WHO, but as there is no mention I can see of this in the text of WHO’s Constitution, I suspect the WHO will take the view that US legislation has no jurisdiction over their decisions. Happy to be corrected! It is always dangerous to ‘correct’ other people on the Internet. Are there any international lawyers in the building? 1948. US Code: §290c. Withdrawal from Organization on one-year notice In adopting this subchapter the Congress does so with the understanding that, in the absence of any provision in the World Health Organization Constitution for withdrawal from the Organization, the United States reserves its right to withdraw from the Organization on a one-year notice: Provided, however, That the financial obligations of the United States to the Organization shall be met in full for the Organization’s current fiscal year. (June 14, 1948, ch. 469, §4, 62 Stat. 442 .) https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:22%20section:290c%20edition:prelim) WHO recognizes the US 2025 withdrawal: WHO comments on United States’ announcement of intent to withdraw https://www.who.int/news/item/21-01-2025-who-comments-on-united-states–announcement-of-intent-to-withdraw Adding, the withdrawal is not a claim over the WHO’s future decisions. It is only divorcing from the WHO’s claims over any future US medical decisions, imo adding: The US Congress passed the signatory treaty only on condition of this exception. It still holds. The Warsaw Pact countries may not have made similar conditions to their signing the treaty in 1948. IANAIL, but Art 56 of the Vienna Convention on Treaties basically says that if a Treaty has no withdrawal provision, states can only withdraw if either the provision should have been included but wasn’t, or if the right to withdraw is somehow implicit in the text (which I don’t think it is. I suspect that in practice, and because the WHO is a subsidiary organ of the UN, it never crossed the minds of the drafters that someone might want to withdraw. Well, you may be right about the Vienna Convention. However, USians being a somewhat stubborn and shrewd lot, imo, ( certainly in 1948 after another ‘great war’), have in Constitutional law the US condition for treaty acceptance, which must be approved by Congress with any provisos the Congress may impose. That is the law of the US. In the US and the WHO case, US law at time of signing prevails. And I thank you for your question and research. It’s an important point. Is that the Meryl Nance of the Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccination group? Shooting the messenger? ;) Ad Hom much?

This article provides a bit more context “Two others suggested the move is aimed at helping the newly installed Trump health officials understand the vast flow of information coming out of the health agencies. The pause, according to one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal agency conversations, “seemed more about letting them catch their breath and know what is going on with regard to” communications. If the communications pause lasts more than a week or two, it could become concerning, that official said, noting that under the Biden administration, White House and HHS officials extensively reviewed material related to the coronavirus before it was released.” https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/trump-officials-pause-health-agencies-communications-citing-review/ar-AA1xCis1 Platforming Moon of Alabama’s ignorant anti-DEI and anti-trans views? Gross. DEI seems like a jobs program for college grad aspiring PMC managers who need more things to manage. The US seems to have a surfeit of aspiring PMC wannabes. / ;) Wait. Are you saying that the Professional Managerial Class is not really the problem but the surfeit number of kids of the Professional Managerial Class trying to hustle themselves some new, made-up bs jobs? :) Why, whatever gives you that idea? / ;) It’s not the kids, it’s been going on for decades. Hiding behind the overtly racist and sexist reasoning of most anti-wokers, you can see glimmerings that some are starting to understand this is the real issue. The problem is not important jobs being filled by non-meritocratic means; the problem is the jobs themselves are BS sinecures that add costs with no benefits, and a secondary problem is that right-wingers are disqualified by ideology from getting most such sinecures so they have no incentive to go along. The scramble for jobs is just that tight. The economy and opportunities are just that bad. But instead of working against monopoly and Wall St powers, working for increased minimum wages, working against offshoring and open borders(increasing competition for entry level jobs,working for universal healthcare and the like, the Woke like the Moral Majority before it makes no economic class claims; it only fights for a bigger piece of an ever shrinking middle class slice of the pie. It is no threat at all to the ever increasing wealth and power of the richest and of Wall St. In that sense it is a distraction from the real economic problems most face. In fact, it gained its biggest jump in public awareness, via the MSM, after O bailed out the TBTF banks and the Occupy Wall St movement. It was as if a memo went out saying “Must change subject from bad bank financial behavior to bad middle class social behavior.” It’s a distraction from the big fight, imo. Seems like it worked, too. / my 2 cents Divide and conquer is an old idea. To quote Gilded Age robber baron Jay Gould: I Can Hire Half the Working Class To Fight the Other Half You have just made an excellent argument for a Vanguard of the Deplorables. Someone has to pick up that pointy ended stick (power) lying in the street and face it in the right direction. Peter Turchin would like to say some words about that. Elite oversupply, etc. You mean like “Chief People Officer”? DEI should be umbrellaed within Creative Writing departments where future baristas congregate. On the opposite end of DEI is the enduring belief in meritocratic hiring practices which in it’s own right is nonsence as well. As one of those evil PMC types, Ive found that the DEI messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed but all the teeth grinding about it comes off as nothing but coping from people who expected the world to be handed to them. Thanks. Good point about opposite ends of the stick. I’d say messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed can be applied to both ends. Nonsensical applications is our default setting. Not disagreeing with you point. Only pointing out the origin of merit hiring was a big push by good government reformers – the so-called goo-goos . It was their efforts to cleanup graft, influence peddling, and the patronage hiring systems in local, state, and federal employment; it was their effort to hire people competent and qualified for the job without regard to a job seeker’s party affiliation or family or business connections. Some states, including my own, were still using the patronage system for big state govt entities into the 1950s. And of course later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (EEOC) included in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was created, expanding the scope of merit hiring. “The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in a broad array of private conduct including public accommodations, governmental services and education. One section of the Act, referred to as Title VII, prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion and national origin. Title VII applies to private employers, labor unions and employment agencies. The Act prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, wages, assignment, promotions, benefits, discipline, discharge, layoffs and almost every aspect of employment.” The issue I have with DEI is that it is missing the letter “C” (Competence.) All the diversity, equity, and inclusion available does not making for a functioning organization, if they don’t have relevant capability. (And I mean ‘capability’ not ‘credential’.) I can’t recall the author – there was a blogosphere post a while back that made an argument that the biggest issue facing the West was overproduction of elites. Peter Turchin is considered the current shepherd of that longstanding idea. His most recent book was reviewed a number of places including here. The Donkey Show banked on a tiny percent of the population being trans being so important that it became all encompassing, or in essence they couldn’t read the room, and then came the broom. It could have be any other wedge issue. Abortion worked for 50 years and #metoo had its time in the sun. If the population ever comes to some sort of agreement in how to deal with transpeople in public, they’ll just put in something else. Maybe polygamists or people who always wear people will be next in line. What’s important is keeping the masses divided and having each other. “… people who always wear people will…” We’re well into ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ territory here. No matter how cynical you are, you are always behind the curve. Major autocorrect snafus by meeee! Could be the next wedge issue – should people practicing terrible grammar online be shunt off in padded cells with very poor cell signal? Should pedantic individuals be a hunted class for HTS snuff videos? Should we all get AI brain implants? Will future wars be fight between people wearing people and people wearing cats? Will the people wearing skunks win? Fear not. There will not be a supply issue concerning “canon fooder” for as long as the population exceeds the dreams of glory of alpha type personalities. Pompous prolix pedants are a credit a dyad. My best guess is that “Online Grammer and Correct Content” will be a part of the curriculum in the FEMA Re-education Centres. I rather like “canon fodder.” DEI is pro segregation. All those racial affinity groups make me sick. Go ask my dad about the affinity bathrooms, affinity water fountains, and affinity schools from his youth in the south. Same thing, different era. More Moon of Alabama please, and less wokie wokism. As Emma pointed out above, identity politics is pro-segregation. The natural result its weaponization is an overweight backlash. This cycle kills any chance of society gaining a beneficial outcome. Using the theory that laws are tools of social engineering, we must ask ourselves, what purposes are the “woke” class of laws intended to promote? Per the above, positing conspiracies for social trends is overly reductionist. Since most social “movements” are the results of one form of a congruence of interests or another, we can somewhat simplify the problem by investigating the milieus from which the impetuses that “power” the ‘movements’ arise. As always, ‘who benefits’ is the primary question. …which would be the consultant class within the booming industry of “elections”. Thanks. Just another way of catering to the 1%. Big profit center. To me, the whole point of the links is to present viewpoints as diverse as the Kyiv Independent to the Valdai book club. If someone wants a safe news feed that just confirms their viewpoints, get a Facebook account. Sorry if that sounded snotty, but your comment was out of line. And that is from someone totally agnostic on DEI matters. It will be a long 4 years! And it didn’t happen soon enough :-) I disagree with it too but Bernard at MoA is good on a lot of foreign policy and military stuff and that’s where he’s coming from. My personal view is D and I are important. We can work on that as eyes open thinking human beings, without getting it hammered into our brains by a staff of 200 headed up by some PhD in gender studies who got a sinecure. E is a cruel joke meant to fog our brains so we ignore getting screwed over by the 1% and its running dogs. None of those letters deserve a senior manager assignment, less a whole department. While we’re at it, let’s get rid of the real baddies – HR! Hedges had this interview with Christian Parenti on woke in general as a problem for academia (as he sees it.) It’s not entirely DEI – but was a bit related I think Sept. 25th 2024 How Wokeness Kills Class Politics and Empowers Empire (w/ Christian Parenti) | The Chris Hedges Report https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/how-wokeness-kills-class-politics The problem with DEI: it´s too complex a scientific matter to give it a general all/nothing treatment. It already starts with the complex biological realities, realities which are scientific facts vs. social realities and the creation of laws and regulations which have to simplify. Yes, I put that up to provoke people just like you, trans advocates who have no problem with running roughshod over women’s rights. As a woman, I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Nor am I on board with people with XY chromosomes competing in women’s sports. People with XY chromosomes, even if they take hormone-suppressive drugs early, have higher levels of muscle mass, sturdier bones, and less joint laxity than XX people, giving them an unfair advantage in sports. Women fought too hard over generations for safe spaces and their own sports to have a tiny minority of trans trample over them. Hear, hear, Yves. Absolutely. Ditto >>I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Not just trans women, but women with a “mannish” appearance are going to be facing a rough time… No, manish doesn’t cut it. That doesn’t matter. There are many “dykes” who are still women, though they make great Tom Boys. Can’t tell a book by looking at the cover. I read a list of track and field records. By age 15, boys outperformed *adult* women in all categories. No trans men in women’s sports. Let us not pretend that there are no genetically determined biological differences between the sexes, particular as regards relative physical strength coupled with a greater propensity for physical aggression, such that there are no venues such as women’s sports, prisons, and safe houses, where the exclusion of biological males is not warranted. I have an idea. Let’s have an all female plebiscite to decide such questions, including trans women if you like, and let the women decide. Take rowing for example. An elite male rower will be 6-6 tall, 210 pounds, and will pull a time of 5.45 on an ergometer for a 2000 meter distance. An elite woman will be 6-1 or 6-2, 170 pounds, and will pull a time of 6.30 on an ergometer, nearly a minute slower. Men are bigger, stronger, and faster, period. On average! In classes as big as men and women, the difference within a class are greater than the differences between the classes. So there will be individual cases otherwise But yes, that average difference is why women are indoctrinated to be submissive and manipulative, since on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. That happens to ‘skinny guys’, as well, in America. Talented comedians are ‘short’ because they have a lifetime of experience avoiding this ‘danger’. YMMV ;) Height-challenged male here, who was very mouthy as a youth. The sport of wrestling was a safe way to take out all my anger, as they classed us by weight! Didn’t say short guys are quiet. Comedians are quite fascile with language and use it to defang big guys. There are no weight classification on ‘the street’. :) on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. . . Unless her name is Dakota Ditcheva. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-01-22/Per-capita-income-in-rural-Xizang-nears-national-level-in-2024-1An2VDnVMmA/p.html January 22, 2025 Per capita income in rural Xizang nears national level in 2024 The per capita disposable income of rural residents in southwest China’s Xizang Autonomous Region saw the fastest growth in the country in 2024, nearing the national average, a remarkable accomplishment considering the region’s challenging plateau conditions. During the year, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in the region was 21,578 yuan (about $3,010), reaching 93.3 percent of the national average level, Li Jianshu, deputy head of the Xizang survey team at the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press conference held during the annual session of the regional people’s congress concluding on Wednesday. The figure marked an 8.3-percent increase from the previous year, 1.7 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate, Li said. He further noted that the per capita disposable income of urban residents reached 55,444 yuan, up 6.8 percent, 2.2 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. The per capita disposable income of all residents in the region surged by 8.2 percent to 31,358 yuan. This growth rate, the highest among the country’s provincial-level areas, exceeded the national average by 2.9 percentage points. Mountain-locked Xizang was once the only provincial-level contiguous poverty-stricken region in China, burdened by its high altitude, harsh environment, poor transportation and limited resources. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure, the booming tourism market, and the accelerated growth of various industries in the region, the income structure of residents in Xizang has greatly improved, leading to enhanced living standards for its people. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure… Amazing. But if you listen to John Stewart, there is a trade-off between “developing Infrastructure” and modernizing public transportation such as NY subways, and that trade-off is our “freedom.” the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty… …but at what cost? Thanks. I particularly enjoyed the header China helping the world is suspicious. “Orwellian” may be tired terminology, but from my perspective…… level of irrelevancy Stewart has sunk to makes road-kill more important – he’s acting punch-drunk now – first Apple beat him up, then called on the carpet for his Wuhan moment on Colbert – now he’s a palooka taking dives – “I could have been a contender” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z66hw6q-zY&t=27s Just when you thought the numismatrix couldn’t get any more silly, the race to out meme one another in matters of cryptocurrency raised it up another notch. Let’s talk ramifications of the eventual reckoning sure to come? We didn’t hear a peep about crypto out of Genocide Joe, but Trump hit the ground running, and he’s an outlier in that it’s a young persons’ Mug’s Game-not something Gen X or Boomers are all that interested in. When they get burned (3rd degree at a minimum, possibly 4th degree lesions) young adult males are gonna be hopping mad, and how do they react? and how do they react? Something tells me it could involve firearms. The AR-15 type has been a popular choice (e.g., Thomas Crooks, Kyle Rittenhouse, et alia), and the vegan activist woman who shot up the YouTube HQ in California (she had been deplatformed) used a 9 mm Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol, but post-Luigi a 3D-printed “ghost gun” is probably the go-to. How do they react? The likely reaction is verbal and actual violence against the weak, also likely preceded by some kind of Immigrant Shock Horror-type news panic or its equivalent… People are transfixed by their dis-infotainment of choice, and too cowardly to go after the actual sources of their suffering, even if they know what it is. Breaking out of that neoliberal fugue state, which requires the quiet and honest introspection that this society is threatened by/incapable of (regardless of political affiliation), seems increasingly remote. As I opined above, the present situation is crying out for a ‘Vanguard of the Deplorables.’ In a less socially retarded society, these silly things like meme coins would not be banned but would be properly classified as gambling. Because there is no utility to $TRUMP or $DOGE we would see them treated like sports betting. Most states now allow sports betting, hence the cottage industry of web sites like Fan Duel, and the NFL embracing gambling on games and not just in Vegas. The past few days have me so excited. Sam Altman, Trump and AI are going to cure cancer…right after the Trump admin retakes the Panama Canal and goes to Mars. My question: will it all get done in the first 100 days? Golden Age in ‘Murca! Does that mean we all better buy gold because it’s all going to sh-t? The customers are usually none too happy when a salesman way oversells the product. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. “Throw another tire on the fire….”, (some Cohen Bros movie, I think is where I got that) Here’s hoping “acceleration” is not ’25’s word of the year. Buy gold? Too late, CostCo is already sold out! >The Black Book of Communism Is a Shoddy Work of History The British Conservative politician Daniel Hannan had a similar message as he prepared for “the most monstrous of centenaries.” According to Hannan, communism was far worse than slavery or Nazism: “The Atlantic slave trade killed perhaps 10 million people, the Nazis 17 million — but the Communists killed 100 million.” The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which runs a museum in Washington, carries the following message on its website: “Communism Killed Over 100 Million: We’re telling their stories.” If we judge by the number of victims, the worst ideology must be capitalism. That is a lot of statistics. Fauci asking when his contributions to world health will get a mention? The industrial era has been far more about capitalism than communism so surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order. In fact the Russian Revolution was in many ways a result of WW1 and WW2 in turn a result of that. And in any case pretending our social life is all about political/economic theories is dubious since wars and victims have been a feature long preceding the ideologies. It is interesting how all the many horrors of capitalism going back to the British and Dutch East India Companies, the Atlantic slave trade, the King Leopold’s Belgian Congo, several large famines in the British Empire, plus much else in the more than four centuries of its existence. Heck, many of the coups done by the United States were and are done for the benefit and often direct requests of corporations. Proponents of capitalism want to look only at the benefits, which often are very large, of capitalism without looking at the extremely high costs of it, which is dishonest. “surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order” It exists: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzbuch_Kapitalismus although Kurz would have preferred to call it ‘The Mills of Satan’ (Die Mühlen des Teufels), in reference to Blake, but the publisher wanted the title for sales reasons. You can download it by searching: Robert Kurz Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus – exit-online.org Communism and capitalism are different flavors of extractive profit economies. The root problem is that in all those societies, a few people ruled over everyone else, imposing law and choosing how to enforce. Same problem in America, Soviet Union, Great Britain, China. No wonder they all have histories of huge amounts of death and exploitation – they’re different flavors of the same underlying problem, where a few people rule over everyone else. All of them forbid people from taking responsibility for their culture and standing up to abuse, because that’s supposedly the police’s job, and they’re not allowed to do their job – honest police, known as whistleblowers, don’t last long in any unhealthy culture. There are actual human societies with a gift economy – that is, economies that reward sharing rather than profiting, and the highest leaders are the ones that share and give the most, rather than elevating the richest or the servants of the rich, as happens in America, China, Russia, etc. If you want an alternative to the tired debates between communism, capitalism, and socialism, I suggest looking at these gift economies. A book called One Disease One Cure goes into all this with many beautiful stories, exploring how people can live in respectful ways, and all the usual trouble that happens when a few people rule over everyone else. Not only that it is way far ahead, but is still counting. P.S. The Nazis killed 17 million, out of which 27 millions of Soviets. art history/ painting “On T. J.

You fire up that Stargate, threw billions into that event horizon, and then you shut it down with no trace of those billions left behind- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8j9Fl34RAU (1:00 mins) According to Musk, neither. https://www.politico.eu/article/us-elon-musk-troll-donald-trump-500b-ai-plan/ Suggestion for miscellaneous: – buy Uber, and rename it to Uber Alles I’m reading in Canadian news that Trump’s executive order reversing DEI targeted and reversed Lyndon Johnson’s executive order 11246 ending discrimination on the basis of race in federal government. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246 Sounds about right. But possibly a happy accident. Like when a cat goes to knock one thing off the counter, but also knocks over another thing that’s even more fun! Haven’t heard anything, yet, from Canadians, about Trump pardoning Proud Boys who are terrorist in Canada, and some other countries. An obvious question is what are the odds Trump will also go after the Civil Rights Act? It seems like a logical next step. These days many seem to equate DEI with anti-white discrimination (which it is decidedly not but facts and truth are irrelevant). And with this move rescinding EO 11246 as part of anti-DEI, Trump is equating the civil rights movement with DEI and with anti-white discrimination, which his administration wants to reverse in all shapes and forms, real or imagined. PLAAF has a sixth generation fighter type aircraft! They will probably build a few dozen and test around them. While the Lockheed is building more aircraft for the dividend flow. Every new F-35, and all those tooling about out in the world, needs a new engine which is not in anyone’s plan! “There’s reason to be worried about the plethora of pardons from Trump and Biden” Politico would never mention it but there is a qualitative difference between Biden’s pardons and Trumps. With Biden he was pardoning his own (crime) family because of all the corruption that they are involved in, political operatives like Milley, the Jan. 6 committee and Fauci to buy their silence and in fact more pardons than any President in history by a long shot. Trump pardoning those protestors was not in the same class. The full might and weight of the US was used like a bludgeon to go after anybody there that day. People who walked quietly through an escort of police, looked at the interiors, took a few selfies, and then left were facing charges that would lead to years in prison. It was gross and needed correcting. Maybe not all of them should have been released but it was the fastest way to do it. Would you believe on the news they claimed that a police officer died that day? Some people died that day and one was murdered but none of them were police. US’ left wing pundits continue to proclaim the Jan 6th political prisoners as attackers. They may have frightened the democrats over the vote fraud, but they deserved a hearing denied them. The issue is that democrats ran Maoist show trials. Pardons merely reverse their crimes against US citizens rights. The continued drivel on the news is boring There had already been over 60 state and federal lawsuits, hearings and investigations by state government and election officials, manual full and partial recounts, and audits, the process and results of which were open to the public. The Capitol rioters may have been there to protest the fact that their preferred candidate wouldn’t be president despite having lost the election, but the “hearing” on this had already occurred. I will also point out that long after the Capitol riot the “hearing” continued with additional investigations including one initiated by the Trump administration, public scrutiny, lawsuits, and at least one full manual recount organized and funded by Republican supporters. That is why Schiff and Cheney need pardons. Ford lost to Carter for using the Pardon power as a get out of jail free card for Nixon. Having re-purposed DoJ for Lawfare, the Ds are now using Pardons as get out of jail free cards at scale. I agree, what Trump did he did for people not tied directly to his own corruption, while Biden is in full get out of jail free mode. Not to suggest Trumps memecoin and innumerable other activities aren’t corrupt, but he’s been playing the legalized crime game his whole life and as such has other buffers for his surrogates. Whenever I read an article that uses the term “debunked” I immediately assume that there is some truth in what they claim is “debunked”. The Raw Story article a case in point – they claim Jim Jordan is still pursuing “debunked” Jan 6 theories – so I figure Jordan is on the right track. – ‘Stefanik paints a grim picture of a UN she wants to reform’ – Politico Stefanik is about as miserable a candidate for our “top diplomat” as one could find, but she follows a long line of these. No surprise here. But what has struck me about her confirmation is the bipartisan support for her confirmation. As this Political article points out: “The moderate Republican turned ardent Trump backer is generally expected to be easily confirmed and without much serious opposition from Senate Democrats who see her as less polemical than other nominees and broadly agree with her on the need to support Israel.” In addition to fighting the Chinese take-over of the UN, Stefanik has pledged to dig out it’s “antisemitic rot.” She also agreed with Smotrich and Ben Givr that Israel has “a biblical right to the entire West Bank.” I’m glad Trump could find a “less polemical” candidate for UN Ambassador. No need for Senate Democrats to slow-walk her confirmation. She’s ready to go! Are you sure she does not think she is being appointed Secretary General? Worse than Bolton? More or less effective? We’ve been sending our worst for decades now. We can all look forward to Rhianna pulling her security detail in 2035. She has some major Upper Class pull, along with the Harvard pedigree and I’ve heard people speculate that this is going to be her foreign policy training, setting her up for a run for POTUS. Her TV stylist has been upping her game over the past year too. I wonder if Trump ordered that, it would be in character. She could have been defeated early. She’s a perfect empty vessel, now battle tested and ready for action “Acceleration, Decapitation, Mobilization” **** At some point (except mobilization) this will make sense. Maybe soon, if the Donbass fronts reach the point of collapse of Ukraine forces on a bigger scale. Trump’s recent comments these past few days show he is just as out of touch and misinformed as his predissors regarding the war in Ukraine – saying Russia has lost “a million men” (and Ukraine much less) its economy is hurting and declining and the war is not going well for Russia and Putin needs to stop the war for domestic and other reasons and needs to get Western sanctions relief. Putin and Russian establishment have repeatedly said Zelensky is not the legitimate President of Ukraine. So what is he? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. So IMO, as Ukraine collapses, they will work with what remains of Ukraine to turn it into a type of terrorist launching pad to inflict whatever damage on Russia that they are able. At some point, Russia will need to fix her mistake of normalizing direct attacks by the West upon her. The time for Russia to accelerate (and maybe decapitate) may be approaching. But then what do I know? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. Biden is gone, Trudeau is gone in a few weeks, Sholz is gone in a few weeks, Starmer is not looking all that good, Orban and Fico would be happy to be out of it as, I think, will Meloni. Macron is looking crippled. I think major support is melting fast. I am not so sure about NATO resolve. “Following Trump’s lead, Lorenzo Sewell, a Detroit pastor who spoke during the president’s inauguration, announced the launch of his own memecoin later that day.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKMjOjg1M&ab_channel=M1/ Richard Pryor Show 1977 – Rev James L White , Who Reminds us of Daddy Rich; God & Federal Green! Pryor was great…Rev Sewell was such an embarrassment to MLK tradition. I can only imagine what some Baptist or other Southern Christian American/black people felt by imagining a NY Italian with his shirt open to his belly button and gold chains around his hairy chest coming out and representing Italian culture. The song in the clip says it all. In one of Richard Pryor’s movies he is an onlooker to a financial huckster promoting some scheme. The Pryor character raises his voice and says that “this looks like a pyramid scheme” . The promoter responds with, “no, no, it’s a trapezoidal scheme”. We need more comedians and the media taking on the financial and political schemers of USA society. But I fear it’s “not gonna happen” “Which Way Is Up” and “Blue Collar” – notable Pryor films about the working class vs “the system”. LOL, I remember that scene. He even shows on the board. its after 9am here, still 19 degrees, with a vigorous southwest wind and windchill around 4 or 5. but itll get up to 55 today, they say…. so’s i can turn on the water, again. let all the birds out for the first time since friday…stupified, blinking in the sun. sheeps reckon they should continue getting fed twice a day. i ended up going forth and cutting more wood at the woodshed, and down there at one of the dead trees along the fenceline in the front pasture. just to keep things running smoothly. still waiting for a part for the woodstove in my room…and man have i missed it. bored out of my mind…sore from laying around under covers in far too many layers of clothes, watching tv. greenhouse toms and peppers made it just fine…because i’m a bad mofo. and have slept for 2 or 3 hours at a time throughout. now, with the sun well up, greenhouse is the place to be…about 65, right now…didnt let it get below 40. plants are rather thirsty, tho. and i smell like a goat…really look forward to a superhot bath this evening, after critters are done….espsom salts, dishsoap and prolly some rosemary tossed in…the big tankless set to 125…then the little booster tankless in greenhouse helping it along…end result is a bath of around 114 by the time i get in it….eureka!, and all. likely make a beer run, since the kegstand is unlikely to thaw in time,lol. and laundry manana afternoon, when it heats up again…and i suppose dishes at some point. it’ll be almost 70 degrees by sunday, they say. one of my superpowers…i endure things…and i endured this. doesnt mean i hafta like it. nebraska can keep their frelling winter weather. Around 6 below zero this morning in Central PA. I’m glad I have a wood stove to help furnace. I’m sure people around here without wood stove will be getting a heck of a heating bill….family in SE Florida freezing in the 57 degree temp, cold for down there. Speaking of the cold, and sorry to change the subject, but this is nuts. I live in a small NW Ohio town. It was below zero last night, and in the single digits for the last few days. There is a young adult girl who lives with her mother in an apartment complex. According to the neighbor she has severe anxiety and claustrophobic characteristics, so she doesn’t go inside. There is a picture of her laying on the front porch of her house with blankets over top of her. She was out there all night. A neighbor called the police and they said they couldn’t do anything. She also contacted a county commissioner. He hasn’t been able to do anything either. How can this happen? How can they allow this girl to lay out there and freeze to death. I don’t know if they even know if she’s alive? She is an adult so you can’t use child abuse angle (I guess, she does live with her mom). I honestly don’t know how this hasn’t went viral. Unbelievable. As an out-of-cert EMT in a 911 community (in a former life) we were able to request that patients be taken into custody if they were a danger to themselves or others. Usually drunks or homeless transients during cold weather. We would be called by the authorities to help make the determination. It’s a tough call. Sometimes, but seldom, appreciated. Thank you for this. I thought something like this is possible. Tough call – no doubt – but it needs to be done. If I were a city council member, police, whoever, I would call for an emergency meeting and demand something be done – by someone. If you are out in these freezing temperatures you are in danger – period. It shouldn’t be difficult. Thanks for your input. I’ll put that task with Amforta’s cat responsibility as things I would not be good at. Swinging back on course, I figure there are a lot of plumbing issues in parts of the country that don’t normally get well below freezing temps. Here in the southern Greens of Vermont, today’s high is 12 and todays low is minus 12, which I woke up to. I got out of bed twice last night to stoke the wood stove. We did get eight inches of very high quality snow Sunday. yeah. we aint set up for this sort of thing. y’all got pipes buried deep, steep roofs, etc. and, using mom as a proxy, i guarantee that i’m likely the only one around here who preemptively shuts off my water and drains the system(built it that way)…because theres few things i dislike more than being a plumber in the mud when its in the 40’s and 50’s, with wind(we’re always windy out here). its also why i do woodstoves…i can burn pallets if i have to…or take the chainsaw to the side of the highway, for that matter. this year and last, ive had a giant pile of what used to be mom’s enormous 100+ year old pecan trees to work on…too big for me to cut up by myself, but eldest likes that sort of work. also have the biggest parts of one of neighbor’s standing dead oaks…4 more along his part of the road i can get whenever i need to. so i got wood…but since im usually on my own, im playing catchup with the cutting and splitting. even so, i dont hafta rely on $ for propane or electricity….save like right now, when one of the woodstoves is missing a part. “normally” we only get a few days like this per year…but its been weird since the 2 week ice age in feb 2021. ive only shut off my water twice, so far…but thats a lot compared to a “normal” winter. during feb 21, whole county lost power for a week…but we managed to keep this big old drafty thing above 40,lol. and used hurricane lamps, etc for light. i’m built for the heat. both me, myself, as well as my structures. give me 105 in the shade any old day. i could never live where some of yall do,lol. and when i’m out at dawn on mornings like this, in the wind, checking on things(another service i get no credit for, i might add)…i think about you folks in vermont, maine and ontario…let alone people i know in edmonton… up to almost 40, wind dyin down…so ima do my town run in a minute…and go cut some wood…then hopefully, the lowest faucet, which happens to be in deep shade on north side of house(had a heater on it for 2 hours) will thaw enough to close, so i can assess that situation,lol. barnyard is easier to turn back on for the same reason its the first i shut off…every faucet is in the open. amazingly, sheep still have water…deicers worked well…and they apparently arent that thirsty when its this cold. sigh. I got a blow dryer duct taped to a hockey stick. That and a couple of clamps for hands free pipe defrosting, heh heh. Not all pipes are deep in the ground. Five dollar propane here. Getting the truck up the drive is the hard part. You got a portable mill? Is pecan wood good for finishing work? Plus, you have oak. About the cold. I’d wager you’d enjoy it without the wind. I sat out last night once the thermometer cracked zero. Somehow the cold intensifies the silence. Downside was my beverage froze up pretty quick. if i have a good fire in the hole at the bar…where im somewhat sheltered from all but east or west wind…i can take it down to about 40…and thats with sufficient beer and/or whiskey, and 3 layrs plus 2 heavy bathrobes, plus furry hat. i read in SciAm some time ago that shivering is how one acclimates to the onset of cold season…trust the science, and all,lol…so ever since, in november, with the first real cold front, you’ll find me remaining nekkid out there…for as long as i can stand it…then layering up by the roaring inferno(old pallets are great for that) and making my way inside…where i will always have woodstoves, etc already doing their thing. again…i do not like the cold. november through february is my very least favorite part of the year. but that sciam method seems to work a bit, as i find i am a bit more cold tolerant than usual. as for today…and dreams of a superhot bath…well, god laughs at our plans. forgot to open one(1) faucet on my side of the system…the one that goes to the shed where W/D lives…and i dont feel like another trip to town.(pipedope mustve gotten cold, bc its all watery and useless…and i was sure i had another ball valve to patch that, but i dont) i want my 2 hours in the warm greenhouse with beer and a hogleg and art pepper and sunshine, ere i go forth and put up critters. still smell like a frelling goat,lol…but i got lotsa cornstarch, some real frankincense, and a nose full of snot anyways….ha!…something cedar fever is good for, at last! I always enjoy your checkins. Enjoy your bath! DEI or no DEI. DEI is segregation. Identity politics is a doorway to unequal outcomes. “Trans” is a tiny population exploded into a world shattering problem. Is any of this true? To what extent is it false? Now there is an executive order mandating two genders. There are two genders in the majority, but then there are those in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. I used to drive from the east coast to western Montana each summer. I did so because I wanted to see what was there. I wanted to see who was there. No surprise that coastal and bi-coastal sophisticates were thin on the ground. And no surprise that the inhabitants of “flyover country” were much like those I had left behind. As Yves says, “Quelle surprise.” Whatever else DEI is or was, it became a bludgeon in the hands of people with a political agenda. I choose not to characterize that agenda except to say the bottom line is or was, “You will do it our way … or else. Or else you will suffer in a manner of our choosing.” Seemed a totalitarian’s way of thinking to me. Are there, were there those with motives of the greatest and most disinterested purity? I am sure there are and were, but they were either never in charge or lost control to the other crowd who found a vehicle for their fantasies of control. Is there a “moral to the story?” Not sure, but if there is I nominate always look at the places in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. That’s a choice sentence and worth a think. Trump 2.0 An addition to this section of links. (Insert voice of Larry Cable Guy’s “git-r-done!”) So D-man’s placement speech wailed on about all sorts of inefficiencies and lack of gov’t’s abilities to confront crises at the homeland. To Angelino readers of NC, maybe one can pass along this bit of news to the new prez while he tours Calif and surveys the scene. Let him know if means to “git-r-done!”, well hands on deck sir. Since the new prez is keen on making schools great again, let not a moment pass when he can take some wind out of Newsom’s sails and announce a yuuge fed-led investment. or else, it’s just another brick let loose off the wall that is US infrastructure. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/la-schools-wrecked-fires-plead-162513682.html “[S]chool officials say they need more than anything else is cash to pay for new places to learn…They are turning to crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to quickly raise money… Of the more than 15,400 structures wrecked by the Palisades and Eaton fires so far, at least 18 schools — including charter or private schools — have sustained significant damage or been destroyed, according to data from the California Department of Education and certain schools. While property insurance and government aid will help cover the cost to rebuild, that will take time that mid-year students can’t afford.” Re DeepSeek, here’s how it wraps up a response to “Tell me about Naked Capitalism.” Congrats to all on proper surfing of this eddy of the AI wave: Conclusion Naked Capitalism is a valuable resource for anyone interested in critical perspectives on finance, economics, and politics. Its commitment to independent journalism and its willingness to question mainstream narratives make it a standout in the world of financial blogging. If you’re looking for an alternative to traditional financial news outlets, Naked Capitalism is well worth exploring. “Chinese AI software DeepSeek was built at a fraction of the cost of American companies like Meta & OpenAI, but performs better. From the user perspective, DeepSeek is 96% cheaper than ChatGPT and other popular LLM.” Considering the Magnificent Seven Stocks and their prominence in the stock market indices and the gains in index funds, I wonder whether the news about the Chinese AI software DeepSeek might cause some disturbance of the AI frenzy pumping up the Magnificent Seven. While part of their value is the result of their control over key avenues of commerce, I suspect there might be some ‘fat’ in their present stock valuations. I asked DeepSeek to recommend some good independent news sources about the war in Ukraine. This is what came up with: 1. The Kyiv Independent 2. Meduza 3. The New Voice of Ukraine 4. Bellingcat 5. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) 6. The Insider 7. Ukrainska Pravda 8. OpenDemocracy 9. The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters 10. Local Independent Media in Ukraine (like Hromadske and Zaborona) That says a lot about their source of training data. You should ask recommendations for bad sources. Scholz at Davos: Europe Must Arm for War with Russia Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? It’s only fair. cupie doll: Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? You wouldn’t want Scholz to share his shelter because you wouldn’t want to be in it with him when an Oreshnik comes calling once he and the EU declare their war on Russia Perhaps he does not want to be reminded of the WWII joke that the abbreviation LSR, for Luftschutzraum (air raid shelter) was subverted by the German population to mean “Lernt schnell Russisch”, i.e. “learn Russian, quick”. From the Tweet: It also potentially enables plenty of AI applications that were just completely unaffordable before. Say for instance that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a “token” is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words). At OpenAI’s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they change $15 per 1 million token. Deepseek’s API however would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable. Great, so now we can cheaply produce inaccurate summaries. Finding a way to make LLM queries potentially profitable is going to unleash an even larger debacle upon the world. It might be a decade before the extent of this debacle becomes clear, depending on how subtle the errors in LLM output are. But others have rightly pointed out that this erodes critical thinking skills, so we’re going to have an entire generation that knows nothing, and has so much damage from COVID, isn’t functional anyway. And this will be the labor basis for our ongoing civilization. Fun times, no? Multiple Pandemics and lack of critical reasoning skills might just ultimately solve the Climate crisis, simply through increasing depopulation and inability to build and maintain damaging toys. Yes, but if you read the commenters above, they neither believe in paying authors for their work or in the concept of competence, so frankly we’ve already entered a new dark age where believing is more important than learning. We just haven’t realized it yet. You’re conflating labor with capital by using the term “work” in an ambiguous way. Maybe we need to start physically punishing PMC when they try to use rhetoric to manipulate others’ emotions using public media. Wdyt? Would that effectively remove petit-bourgeois self-righteousness from the public sphere? It takes a lot of work to write a book, as you’d know if you ever wrote one. If you are lucky, you can sell the book (i.e. its copyright) to pay for that work so as to be able to eat. That’s what copyright was invented for because book printers would simply steal the content. They had the capital (the book presses) and the author got nothing. Somehow today people believe they are entitled to read that book, or train an AI with it, and the author should get nothing. That’s a good way to end authorship, and ensure the only future reading material will be press releases. You forget the era post WWII where Gov funded science and it was shared widely/freely to expand discovery manifold. Gov held the IP, as it were, only gifted away and be abused by private interest for self interest via social status incentives. Social psychology informs more here than dialectal rationalizations. Not to mention per your thrust that most that is written these days is more a matter of post marketing and not individual artist driven motives. All made more complex by how Silicon Valley sorts lead the agenda to gate keep all and everything by being the both platform for readers and library they could pay to read. I mean just look at the Reese Witherspoon Book Club Model Lmmao …. look it up mate … Elon Musk will reinvent copyright, and fix everything. Well, considering how much of the history of intellectual production you erased from history just so you could perform your little virtue signal and conserve your tiresome little institution games, maybe you are incompetent to discuss the matter of copyright. You’ve all proven yourselves manifestly unqualified to run a larp for 2500 years and you think your childish sniveling rises to the level of a FACT? Lmfao, even. I feel no shame whatsoever trampling all over your epistemic “private property” considering that you’re a liar by omission. Also, as AI generated output proliferates, it will increasingly generate content from its own output. AI coprophagy (eating one’s own excrement) is not a recipe for quality output. Concur. I thought I would write a few lines about a sensible gun law that was passed by the California Legislature when I was still living in Oakland more than 20 years ago. That law required the California DOJ to compare the names and Id’s of convicted felons and wife beaters with the names of ID’s of people who had registered firearms before the became prohibited persons. Where there was a match ( As in the case of Sherrif Ross Mirkarimi) the DOJ would generate a letter to that criminal requiring that they provide proof that either their conviction was being appealed or that they had disposed of their firearms legally, withing 30 days. If said proof was not provided in a timely manner a felony arrest warrant was issued and sent to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service. The first objection came from a Southern California Sheriff ( IIRC Riverside County) who complained to the press that if he enforced the law he wouldn’t have any patrol deputies left ( He said the quiet part out loud) the PIO of that office confirmed that @35% of their deputies had pled guilty to spousal abuse. A few other reporters queried other LAw enforcement agencies and the ones that were dumb enough to answer came up with figures as low as 20%. Needless to say not many reporters pursued the matter…their editors and owners were not enthused. The other reason cops didn’t like the Law was that someone might get hurt, someone who mattered…like a cop. So the Cops pursued matters that were much more important, like Civil Asset Forfeiture which yields $4,000,000,000 in profits per annum and which is armed robbery under color of Law. Meanwhile in Gaza. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/22/day-1-gaza-ceasefire/ OK, could someone explain the phrase, “Open source software that gates basic auth behind a paywall?” I know what open source is, and I know what a paywall is, but I am unclear on the whole, “Gates Basic Auth,” thing. I think that they are saying that the vendor is claiming that it is open source, but requires payment to access the program, which would not make it open source, and it might potentially make it fraud.

Title: SK Hynix’s 26% Gain This Year Under Pressure From Trump Trades

(Bloomberg) -- This year’s 30% AI-driven rally in shares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. faces threats as political issues and valuations push local investors toward domestic-focused companies. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Korean retail traders are on course for their biggest monthly withdrawal from the memory chipmaker in at least a decade. With the stock on course for its best January since 2009, market observers say the temptation to take some money off the table is high. AI leader Nvidia Corp. lost steam this month on concerns over competition and slower growth. Korean investors, meanwhile, have been rotating into non-tech beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s policies as well as smaller local stocks expected to enact corporate reforms. “The market is paying more attention to the issues that could see swift changes after Trump takes office,” such as in the energy sector, said An Hyungjin, chief executive officer at Seoul-based Billionfold Asset Management Inc. “I have concerns that if Nvidia’s rally stalls, whether SK Hynix can gain further.” Results due Thursday morning from SK Hynix are expected to show record quarterly net income of 5.9 trillion won ($4 billion). That comes as the firm is benefiting from its position as a leading supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to work alongside Nvidia’s AI processors. Its share price has more than doubled in two years on the AI excitement, though that lags far behind the sevenfold gain in Nvidia. The broader chip sector, including memory, has been restrained by lingering concerns over sluggish demand for autos and electronics. SK Hynix shares gained 3.4% on Wednesday, joining a rally across regional peers, after US President Donald Trump’s announcement about a joint venture to fund AI infrastructure. Korean investors may be taking profits on SK Hynix after its big gains, “as memory prices are still expected to be trending downwards in the first half of 2025,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. At the same time, foreign investors that have driven the stock higher “could be viewing memory as a laggard in the AI space.” SK Hynix’s rally has made the stock look pricey. Its trading at a price-to-book ratio to 2.8 times, above its three year average of 1.6 times. Beyond valuations, investors are being lured away from the tech sector and into sectors including shipbuilding and nuclear power on expectations for boosts from Trump’s policies. At home, some investors expect the opposition party’s corporate reform agenda to gain traction following the impeachment of the President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law. Smaller, domestically focused companies with room for improvement on shareholder returns are seen as particular beneficiaries. “There are many companies that could outperform with the commercial code revision,” said Marcello Seongsoo Ahn, a portfolio manager at Quad Investment Management Co. “SK Hynix shares may rise but their gains will be outpaced by those companies.” Top Tech Stories President Donald Trump announced a joint venture to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure worth billions of dollars with the leaders of Softbank Group Corp., OpenAI LLC, and Oracle Corp., an effort aimed at speeding development of the emerging technology. Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products. Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.
