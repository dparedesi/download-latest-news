(Reuters: Robert Galbraith) Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. The milestone highlights what has been widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since the introduction of the first iPhone 18 years ago. AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. It puts the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $US4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, the milestone marked what is being widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $US1 trillion, $US2 trillion and eventually, $US3 trillion. Technology multinational Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia's rise comes as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone, while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialised chips. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $US325 billion for investments in the technology this year, with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason the company's stock price have increased 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $US400 billion to $US4 trillion. After exceeding $US4 trillion for the first time early on Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $US162.88. But most analysts do not expect the price to stay below $US163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock would climb to $US196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $US4.8 trillion. Jensen Huang's widening fame has been accompanied by a fattening fortune. (AP: Sarah Meyssonnier) Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as "the godfather" of AI, with his dissertations about the technology's direction attracting enraptured audiences. Mr Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $US142 billion. It looked like Nvidia might have hit a road block in early April when US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered a widespread sell-off on the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $US87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by a $US18.8 billion profit, despite a $US4.5 billion hit to account for US government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China. The California company is scheduled to release its next quarterly report on August 27.

Title: Delete WhatsApp and Install Signal

Time Published: 2025-07-09T22:15:56Z

Andrew Steele WhatsApp is the world's most popular instant messaging service, and it's owned by Meta—the same company behind Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. If you value your privacy and digital security, I strongly recommend removing all of these apps from your phone. If there are any you absolutely can't live without, at minimum revoke every permission you can to protect yourself from the serious privacy and security risks these apps pose. The best alternative to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is Signal, which offers genuinely private and secure messaging. Signal encrypts all your messages and metadata, meaning Signal itself knows almost nothing about you. Crucially, it's run by a nonprofit organisation, not a corporation whose entire business model depends on harvesting your personal data to sell targeted advertising. For Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, you're far safer accessing them through your web browser rather than installing their apps. Even if most of your contacts use WhatsApp, you can make a difference by encouraging the people you contact the most to move to Signal. If most of your messages are on Signal—and then likely the most sensitive ones too—you can start to take back your privacy. And secondly, if we all start to do this, it will mean more people are on Signal, hopefully gradually making it more attractive to move across! If you don't read any further, this is the short version: Delete Meta's apps, use Signal for messaging, and access social media through your browser instead. While WhatsApp claims* your message contents are end-to-end encrypted, Meta extensively collects the 'metadata' around your conversations. This includes who you message, when you message them, how often you communicate, and your location data. WhatsApp's privacy policy states that the app collects extensive usage logs, including the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This metadata collection creates a detailed profile of your most private relationships and activities. If you message your therapist, doctor, lawyer, or visit sensitive locations like medical clinics, Meta instantly knows something deeply personal about you—information that could be legally or personally compromising. Even worse, they scan your entire contact list to build social networks of people who may not even use Meta's services, creating detailed profiles of individuals who never consented to this data collection. * Because WhatsApp is ‘closed-source’, we can’t examine the code to check their claims. However, given that you can report messages to Meta for violating the terms of use, they clearly do have mechanisms to read messages. Signal, on the other hand, is ‘open-source’, meaning that anyone can read the source code, and independent experts have verified that it’s private and secure. Meta's track record on privacy is…not great. Here are some of their most egregious violations: Meta allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, which was then used to manipulate political campaigns. The company was fined $5 billion by the FTC for this breach—yet their stock price actually went up after the fine was announced, showing how little these penalties actually deter such behaviour. Between September 2024 and early June 2025, Meta's Android apps (Facebook and Instagram) covertly tracked users' web browsing, even in incognito mode, or if using a VPN. Meta used this method without obtaining consent from users, linking browsing history to Facebook and Instagram profiles. This tracking was so invasive that even Google called it abusive. The fact that Meta was willing to engage in such underhanded data collection means that simply having one of their apps on your phone poses a serious privacy and security risk. Facebook used phone numbers that users provided for security purposes (like two-factor authentication) for advertising targeting—a direct violation of user trust and their stated privacy policies. And, just a few weeks ago, WhatsApp started asking users to add their email address ‘for extra security’. Uh-huh… Meta now requires you to manually opt out of having your WhatsApp conversations fed to their AI in every single chat you participate in. This feature was rolled out with virtually no fanfare—I discovered this 'feature' by accident, meaning my private conversations had probably already been processed by Meta's AI systems. While Meta claims this is only for local AI features like enhanced search (eg, if you type ‘find me that time Andrew complained about how terrible WhatsApp is for privacy’ into the search bar, and it will dig out that bit of chat), the reality is that training data for AI models is one of the most valuable commodities in tech today. Given Meta’s track record of privacy violations, can you trust them not to use your intimate conversations in their ongoing AI development? The Facebook app now includes a setting asking users to upload every photo on their camera roll to Meta's AI for 'cloud processing' and unspecified 'suggestions'. Think about what's in your photo library: that picture of a rash you took to show the doctor, pictures of your whole family on the beach in swimwear, that snap you took of your passport in case you lose it, screenshots of personal information… Do you really want Meta having access to every image you've ever captured on your phone? And can you be sure that Meta won’t roll out a ‘feature’ like this to their other apps in future? Again, images are a hugely valuably commodity for AI training these days—the incentive is definitely there for Meta to hoover them all up. Meta makes plenty of money from WhatsApp both by using the data it gathers to serve ads on its other platforms and by business accounts paying for certain features. But apparently this isn’t enough, and there are ads directly in WhatsApp now. This is just in the ‘stories’ tab for now—which honestly I don’t use very much—but it really wouldn’t come as a surprise to get a ‘helpful’ suggestion for a pizza place next time I’m telling someone that I’m hungry in a WhatsApp chat…or maybe an ad for a therapist next time I mention I’m not feeling great? When advertising is the primary business model, privacy inevitably takes second place. The safest approach is to completely uninstall all Meta apps from your phone. If you absolutely must keep some for work or social reasons, you can try to limit the risk by doing the following: However, given Meta's willingness to exploit Android vulnerabilities for covert tracking, having any of their apps installed remains a privacy risk. I wish I could delete WhatsApp entirely, but it requires a critical mass of people to make the switch before Signal becomes the default messaging platform. That's where you come in. Try Signal today, and convince your friends and family to join you. It's one of the simplest and most effective actions you can take to protect not just your own privacy, but to help create a more secure digital world for everyone. The choice is clear: continue letting Meta profit from your most intimate communications, or take control of your digital privacy. What will you choose? Your email address will not be published.

Title: Who Should Avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF? Risks and Drawbacks Explained

Time Published: 2025-07-09T21:17:37Z

The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is often praised for its outstanding performance, particularly during technology-driven bull markets. Backed by the Nasdaq-100 index, QQQ gives investors exposure to some of the most innovative and fastest-growing companies in the world, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. But while it’s a fan favorite for growth-seeking investors, the Nasdaq QQQ ETF isn’t a one-size-fits-all investment. Lets break down who should avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF, explore its potential risks and limitations, and explain why it’s not suitable for every portfolio. Whether you’re a new investor, a conservative saver, or a retiree managing withdrawals, this guide will help you decide if QQQ belongs in your investment strategy. Contents The Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. This index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It’s heavily weighted in technology, but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare. The fund is widely regarded as a strong option for long-term growth investors. But like any investment, it comes with trade-offs. Before diving into why you might want to avoid it, let’s touch on why many investors love QQQ: But these strengths can quickly turn into weaknesses if they don’t align with your risk tolerance or investment goals. Let’s break down the types of investors who might want to steer clear of QQQ, and the reasons why. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is built for aggressive growth, not stability. It often experiences sharper declines during market downturns due to its high exposure to tech and other volatile sectors. If you’re looking for a safe, low-volatility investment for peace of mind, QQQ likely isn’t the best fit. Investors who are in or approaching retirement usually prioritize capital preservation and income over growth. QQQ’s volatility and low dividend yield make it less suitable for this stage of life. If you’re withdrawing funds regularly, a more conservative, income-focused ETF or bond allocation may be more appropriate. If you follow a value investing strategy—buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals—then QQQ likely doesn’t align with your approach. Value investors often prefer funds that track the Russell 1000 Value Index or individual stocks with low valuations. QQQ is highly concentrated in technology and a few mega-cap stocks. If you’re looking for balanced exposure across sectors, QQQ might not give you what you need. If true diversification is your goal, consider a total market ETF like VTI or a multi-sector portfolio. While QQQ has delivered incredible long-term returns, it can be extremely volatile in the short term. Many traders get in expecting fast profits and panic sell during corrections. If you’re not prepared for the ups and downs, or you’re new to investing, QQQ might lead to losses instead of gains. Aside from being a poor fit for certain investors, there are inherent risks with investing in QQQ. Understanding these helps you make better decisions. QQQ is heavily weighted in a small number of mega-cap tech stocks. If a few of these companies underperform, the entire ETF suffers. With tech dominating the fund, sector-specific downturns (like tech crashes or regulatory crackdowns) can disproportionately hurt performance. QQQ isn’t ideal for income investors. The yield is much lower than broader market ETFs or dividend-focused funds. High-growth tech stocks generally underperform in rising interest rate environments. This makes QQQ vulnerable when rates are hiked. Some of QQQ’s top holdings have high valuation multiples. If earnings fail to meet expectations, prices can fall hard. If QQQ doesn’t align with your goals or risk tolerance, here are some alternatives: Despite the drawbacks, QQQ can still be a great investment for the right investor: The key is understanding the risks and making sure they align with your strategy. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is powerful, but it isn’t perfect. It shines in bull markets and tech rallies, but stumbles during periods of volatility or interest rate hikes. It can be an excellent tool for wealth building—but only if it fits your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. If you’re nearing retirement, seeking income, or prioritizing sector diversification, QQQ may not be for you. Instead, look toward more balanced, conservative ETFs that better match your objectives. Bottom Line: Know your financial goals, understand your risk appetite, and choose investments that align with both. QQQ is not inherently bad it’s just not for everyone.

WSB Now SAN FRANCISCO — (AP) — Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia on Wednesday became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market valuation, putting the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, reaching the milestone highlighted the upheaval being unleashed by an AI craze that's widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. Nvidia's rise as come as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI with an array of new features that included a more than year-old promise to smarten up its often bumbling virtual assistant Apple acknowledged last month that delivering on its AI vision is going to take until at least next year, leading some industry analysts to wonder if the company will have to acquire an AI start-up to regain momentum. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined forces with OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialized chips that power the energy-intensive data centers underlying artificial intelligence. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $325 billion for investments in the technology this year — with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason that the company's stock price increased by 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $400 billion to $4 trillion. After exceeding $4 trillion for the first time early Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $162.88. But most analysts don't expect the price to stay below $163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock will climb to $196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $4.8 trillion. Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as “the godfather” of AI, whose dissertations about the technology's direction attract enraptured audiences. Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $142 billion. It looked like Nvidia may have hit a road block in early April when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered widespread selloff in the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by an $18.8 billion profit, despite a $4.5 billion hit to account for U.S. government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China.

Title: Nvidia beats Microsoft and Apple to $4 trillion market cap

Some of you may remember that Nvidia posted a very strong quarter in its Q1 FY2026 results. The company raked in $44.1 billion in revenue, which was a 69% increase from the same quarter last year and a 12% bump over the previous quarter. Nvidia has forecasted an even stronger quarter in Q2 FY2026, with revenue figures expected to be at the $45 billion mark. However, ahead of that actually happening, the firm has hit a pretty major milestone. Nvidia has become the first company in the world to achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion after the company's stock price rose by over 2% today, as noted by CNBC. The company has surpassed both Apple and Microsoft in reaching this milestone, which is a major feat considering that both companies hit the $3 trillion market cap ahead of Nvidia. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.7 trillion, Apple is at $3.1 trillion, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is sitting comfortably at $2.1 trillion, and Meta is holding strong at $1.8 trillion. Nvidia's market cap has been boosted by strong demand for its specialized and general purpose hardware during this age of generative AI. The chipmaker really hit its stride after the meteoric growth in popularity of ChatGPT in late 2022. In addition, many companies - like Microsoft - which offer public cloud platforms to their customers rely on Nvidia's hardware for various workloads. That said, Nvidia has faced its fair share of challenges too. A recent U.S. government restriction requires it to utilize new licenses to export H20 products to China, which is expected to cost the firm $8 billion in lost sales. Notably, the $45 billion revenue estimate that Nvidia shared for the current quarter already accounts for this loss, which means that its revenue would have been above $50 billion otherwise. It will be interesting to see if other tech firms are able to catch up to Nvidia or if the chipmaker will continue sailing out of reach.

Business A NVIDIA logo is pictured on its facility at the High-tech park at Yokne'am, in northern Israel Jul 9, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Shir Torem) NEW YORK: The stunning rise of Nvidia to become the first publicly traded company valued at US$4 trillion underscores the massive importance to the stock market of the AI chipmaker and the technology sector. Reaching the lofty milestone caps a massive run for Nvidia's stock price, which has soared some 1,350 per cent since October 2022. This year, the chipmaker's shares are up about 22 per cent against a 6 per cent rise for the S&P 500. The company's market value hit US$4 trillion in morning trading on Wednesday (Jul 9), about 13 months after it had first reached the US$3 trillion milestone. Nvidia's stock surge has given it significant weight in key equity indexes and ETFs that are more heavily influenced by companies with the biggest market values.

Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

Title: The 15 best deals from Walmart's big Prime Day rival sale
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/deals/best-walmart-deals-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-09T18:47:58Z

Although Amazon Prime Day is limited to Prime members only, you don't need to be subscribed to score some major savings this week. Walmart is running a massive competing sale until Sunday, and we've gathered the best Walmart deals rivaling those of Prime Day, below. Some of the best Walmart deals this year are on tech products, with prices matching many Amazon Prime Day discounts. Apple is particularly strong, with $120 off the new iPad Air and a 30% discount on the Apple Watch Series 10 42mm. But if you're looking to beat Amazon prices, home and kitchen is the way to go. The 21-piece beige Carote nonstick cookware set is just $100 at Walmart, while an incredibly similar cream white set is just over $123 for Prime Day. Deals are going fast, too. At $100 off, the Blackstone ProSeries 2-burner is sold out for shipping and delivery (although you can always try finding one for pickup at a nearby store). While the sale lasts through July 13, we recommend buying sooner rather than later if you see something you're interested in, since items often go out of stock. You can explore more sales in our best Prime Day deals hub and our guide to the best Prime Day competing sales. Apple is a popular category this year from Walmart, with iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, and more down to all-time lows. These prices are just as low as Amazon's during Prime Day, making now a good time to buy. The new M3 iPad Air models include an upgraded processor and added video editing features over last year's models. Otherwise, they offer the same design and features as their predecessors in the same 11-inch and 13-inch form factors. Apple's refreshed AirPods Max headphones support USB-C charging and come in five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware delivers the same excellent audio quality we heard on the original model from 2020. A firmware update in April 2025 enabled wired audio support with lossless sound. The AirPods Pro 2 are a big upgrade from their predecessors, with improved noise cancellation and battery life. They also support new aural health features to assess your hearing and function as hearing aids. This model comes with a USB-C charging case and added dust resistance. The 11th-generation iPad largely mirrors the 10th-generation iPad from 2022, apart from its upgraded A16 chip and increased storage. It lacks Apple Intelligence, but it's the cheapest option in the brand's lineup and more than enough for most users. The 44mm Apple Watch SE is simply a larger model than the 40mm SE, and is otherwise identical. The Apple Watch SE is the perfect blend of features and affordability. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with larger display sizes and cases (including a new titanium option). It runs on the latest S10 processor and has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. Apple's handy tracking device comes bundled in a discounted four-pack. Airtags are easy to set up and allow you to track multiple items in the Find My app alongside your friends and devices. The Apple Pencil (USB-C) is compatible with any iPad that has a USB-C port. These days, that's any iPad Apple sells today. It charges via USB-C, but it can still attach magnetically to your iPad. It's a little more basic than the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil, but it does support Apple's Hover feature for the iPad Pros. When it comes to tech, Walmart loves to compete with Amazon's low Prime Day pricing by matching deals for TVs, gaming, and more. These deals are as good, if not better, than what Prime members can score this week. The Linkbuds Fit are good earbuds for various workouts, but we found their design to be especially good for bike riding since they don't stick out and mess with helmet straps. This Roku Smart TV lets you stream all of your favorite apps with 4K resolution and an enhanced voice remote. The 50-inch Vizio MQX is a budget-friendly QLED built with gaming in mind. It has a higher refresh rate than most competing sets this size, which can offer smoother gameplay when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game and three months of Meta Quest+ (combined $70 value). If budget is your main priority, the Samsung Galaxy A16 is a solid choice. Its performance is fast enough for most users, and if you can find it on sale, it's even more worthwhile. Coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, and other home goods are popular products to find on sale during Prime Day, so Walmart is meeting the heat by dropping prices just as low as Amazon. Brands like Bissell, Dyson, Keurig, and KitchenAid are all available now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. So, the portable Bissell Little Green cleaner is a great option for small spaces like apartments, tiny houses, and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or potentially even under your sink. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This mixer packs a punch with a large stainless steel bowl meant for mixing big batches of heavier foods. It comes with 11 mixing speeds and is compatible with multiple attachments. Whether you're looking for a frying pan, a large pot, or something to stir and flip with, Carote's massive selection of nonstick cookware can help build out a kitchen. This Keurig takes the signature brewer to a new level with app compatibility so you can customize and schedule your brew. Plus, you can choose from five strength settings and six temperature settings. This corded electric Dyson is self-righting and comes with four other tools in addition to the Turbinehead to get maximum coverage on different surfaces. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum is a lightweight cleaning solution that balances battery run time and suction. The chair comes with three accent pillows and rotates on a 360-degree swivel base. This traditional kit comes with 20 treatments of whitening strips, with the goal of getting teeth 18 levels whiter within 20 days. The Sonic-Fusion combines an electric toothbrush and a Waterpik to score double the power of traditional brushing and flossing on getting rid of plaque and keeping gums healthy. This device is accepted by the American Dental Association. With the Schick Intuition Sensitive Care razor, there's no need for a separate can of shaving gel because it's built right into the razor cartridge. The AncestryDNA + Traits kit gives you all of the same information as you get from the above kit plus over 25 of your most interesting traits as determined by your genetics so you can learn about where your characteristics came from. Walmart Plus is an entire membership program designed to benefit regular shoppers at Walmart. It gets you free delivery on groceries from your local store with no minimum spend, fuel discounts, and other promo offers throughout the year. In an answer to Amazon's Prime Video bonus, you also get a free Paramount+ subscription packed with TV and movie content. While Walmart Plus subscribers got early access to Walmart's deals this week, you don't need to be a member to shop the sale now. Unlike Prime Day, the sales are for anyone and don't require any form of membership. Walmart Plus subscriptions offer more than just shopping perks. Like Amazon Prime, memberships unlock an impressive suite of benefits, including access to Paramount Plus Essential, free online pet care through Pawp, Burger King savings opportunities, and more. Most notably, memberships come with free shipping (no order minimum) and free delivery ($35 minimum) from your local store. You can learn more on the Walmart Plus membership page. The grand Walmart or Amazon debate is totally dependent on you and your needs. You can learn more about the two services and their respective perks in our Amazon Prime vs. Walmart Plus guide, where we note that while the memberships offer different value, Prime Day deals tend to be a bit better when it comes to variety and value.

These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Nvidia made history by becoming the world’s first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached as Nvidia’s stock price surged to $164.42 during intraday trading on July 9. The company’s stock has soared by approximately 1,460% over the past five years, with a near 18% gain registered year-to-date. Nvidia’s ascent is driven by its near-monopoly on AI chip manufacturing, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) forming the backbone of machine learning, data centers, and large language models. The Silicon Valley giant’s chips are now essential for tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Nvidia’s historic rally has had a dramatic impact on the personal fortune of its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. As of July 2025, Huang’s net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $140 billion, up $25 billion this year alone. Huang owns about 3.5% of Nvidia, making him the largest individual shareholder. This surge places Huang among the world’s 10 richest individuals, with his fortune closely tracking Nvidia’s stock performance. Nvidia now holds the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500 index, surpassing tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The milestone has fueled optimism for further growth, with some analysts projecting Nvidia’s market cap to keep rising. Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah sees Nvidia at the “front-end” of the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI pushing it past $6 trillion in coming years.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

And the most valuable company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia on Wednesday became the world's first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company ever. The company's stock price is driven by the AI frenzy as well as its unique position in the AI ecosystem as the key supplier of hardware and software stack for training and inference. By reaching the $4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia not only left behind such tech giants as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft, but also the vast majority of semiconductor companies. Only Broadcom ($1.298 trillion) and TSMC ($1.2 trillion) are in the Top 10 of the world's most valuable companies and are among the three semiconductor firms to reach a trillion-dollar capitalization mark. Other semiconductor companies, such as ASML ($313.22 billion), AMD ($226.76 billion), Texas Instruments ($197.61 billion), Arm Holdings ($161.3 billion), and Qualcomm ($175.67 billion) are far from touching a $1 trillion market capitalization. Intel, once an investors' darling, is now valued at $101.26 billion. Such a huge difference between the market capitalization of Nvidia and its industry peers underscores the unique position that Nvidia holds in today's high-tech ecosystem. The company supplies AI GPUs to virtually all of the AI leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, just to name a few. So far, only Microsoft Azure has warned that it would slow down the expansion of its data centers. Other companies are well on track to expand their AI clusters to hundreds of thousands or even millions of Nvidia GPUs in the coming years, so the sky is blue for Nvidia. Observers believe that investors' optimism about Nvidia stems from three factors. Firstly, they expect the AI sector to continue growing in the coming years, which will ensure growing sales of AI hardware. Secondly, Nvidia is expected to sustain its leading position on the market as so far, no company has unveiled hardware that can match the performance and scalability of Nvidia's GPUs for AI training and inference. Thirdly, investors now expect the U.S. to reach trade deals with the most important partners, which will ensure the company's ability to supply its products to growing markets, including the Middle East and Europe, which will offset the company's current inability to supply high-performance AI GPUs to China.

Title: Ambani's Reliance Jio delays India IPO beyond this year: Report
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambanis-reliance-jio-delays-india-ipo-beyond-this-year-report-11752071301806.html
Time Published: 2025-07-09T14:36:35Z
Full Content:
NEW DELHI/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Indian telecoms and digital giant Reliance Jio Platforms, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has decided not to launch its planned IPO this year, delaying one of the country's most anticipated stock offerings, two people familiar with the matter said. Valued by analysts at more than $100 billion, Jio wants to achieve higher revenue and a bigger subscriber base for its telecoms business while expanding its other digital offerings to boost its valuation before an initial public offering, one of the sources said. Shares of parent conglomerate Reliance Industries fell sharply in Mumbai after the Reuters report, losing as much as 1.8%, or $6 billion in market value. Reliance closed 1.2% down, with its significant weighting in other indexes dragging the broader Indian market into negative territory. Nearly 80% of Jio Platforms' latest annual revenue of $17.6 billion came from its telecoms business -- Reliance Jio Infocomm, India's biggest player. But Ambani is also accelerating expansion of his other niche digital businesses focused on developing apps, connected devices and AI business solutions. Reliance Jio is also set to lock horns with Elon Musk, who is expected to launch the Starlink internet service in India in the coming months. Jio, which counts Google and Meta among investors, has also partnered Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure. Ambani said in 2019 that Jio and Reliance Retail will move towards listings within five years. And last year Reuters reported that Reliance was targeting a 2025 Mumbai listing for Jio Platforms, aiming for it to be India's biggest IPO. "Jio (IPO) is not going to happen this year, it's just not possible. The company wants the business to be more mature," the first source said. Both the sources, who declined to be identified because the strategy is confidential, said Reliance had yet to appoint bankers to discuss a potential stock market offering. Reliance did not respond to Reuters queries on the matter. Jio Infocomm has faced some churn in its subscriber base after price increases but has returned to growth this year and has more than 488 million subscribers. Indian brokerage IIFL Capital said in April that it was cutting its 2025-26 core profit estimate for Jio by 3%, citing higher costs and the expected increase in prices, probably in late 2025. It also cut its valuation estimate from $117 billion to $111 billion, though Jefferies values the business at $136 billion. The first source declined to share the valuation that Jio had been targeting for the proposed IPO but said it was "easily above $100 billion". India's IPO market had its best year in 2024, with $20.5 billion raised, second only to the United States. Trade wars and Middle East tension have turned market sentiment jittery, but it is recovering. India is the world's second-biggest IPO market with $5.86 billion raised by June this year, accounting for the 12% of total proceeds globally, LSEG data shows. Reuters has previously reported that the Reliance Retail IPO was being delayed for the company to address operational challenges at the company that runs India's biggest grocery store network of 3,000 supermarkets. The Reliance Retail IPO is unlikely before 2027 or 2028, the first source added without elaborating. Reliance Retail and Jio have powered the parent's earnings in the six months to March while its energy segment has been hit by lower margins and weaker demand. Ambani, Asia's richest man, has raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecoms and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, General Atlantic and Silver Lake in recent years. "The investors are not upset (about IPO delays). They know the money is sitting in front of them," the first source said.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI Chips Are “The New Gold And Oil,” Says Investment Bank As Firm Briefly Crosses $4 Trillion Market Value

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU designer NVIDIA Corporation made history today by becoming the first company in history to cross a $4 trillion market capitalization before slightly dipping below it. NVIDIA's achievement follows a surge in its shares in June after a massive crash in January that saw the firm bleed $600 billion in market capitalization after investors fed the shares, worrying that China's DeepSeek had demonstrated cost-effective GPU use that could cull the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. June was a strong month for NVIDIA's shares as they benefited from bullish analyst estimates for medium-term AI demand. NVIDIA continues to enjoy a dominant role in the AI ecosystem courtesy of its GPUs, which lead the market in terms of performance and are among the most highly sought products in the world. The criticality of NVIIDA's GPUs was evident in a fresh note from Wedbush, which came just as the firm crossed the $4 trillion market capitalization milestone. Calling NVIDIA's AI chips "the new gold and oil," the investment bank posits that $4 trillion is just the start and investor attention will focus on $5 trillion over the next 18 months. Wedbush adds that NVIDIA might not be the only $4 trillion company, as it might be joined by software giant Microsoft. NVIDIA's shares have stayed resilient despite US sanctions on China, which have hurt the firm's revenue. The robust performance is partly due to CEO Jensen Huang pivoting to sovereign AI after the Chinese restrictions to assure investors that NVIDIA can sell its chips to other countries as well. Like NVIDIA, Microsoft's shares were also laggards at the year's start. The stock had struggled since mid-2024 after investors were left wondering whether the software company could adequately monetize its AI cloud computing offerings. However, Microsoft's latest earnings report shifted the narrative, as 33% Azure growth during its fiscal third quarter ended up allaying investor concerns. "We believe Microsoft will also hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club," said Wedbush as it believes that the AI-led stock market growth is still in its nascent stages. Going all-in on AI, the investment bank shares that "it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years" and adds "that for every $1 spent on Nvidia, there is an $8-$10 multiplier across the rest of the tech ecosystem." While Wedbush's note focuses primarily on enterprise AI, the bank briefly mentions that Alphabet, Amazon and Meta are its favorite players in consumer AI. Notably missing is Apple, whose 13% year-to-date share price drop is partly due to investor belief that the firm has fallen behind big tech when it comes to AI. The bank concludes its note by sharing that it is seeing "many IT departments focused on foundational hyper scale deployments for AI around Microsoft, Amazon, and Google with a laser focused on the software driven use cases currently underway as high priority AI use cases have been identified and now being driven/accelerated across a myriad of verticals."

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recently spoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last year expressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEO John Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO, Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president, Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president, Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are "enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Witz and her husband left lunch with a copy of Barry Diller's book, "Who Knew." Lütke and his wife, Fiona McKean, wore denim as they walked to a morning session at the conference. McKean wore a top from Finnish design house Marimekko. Kent layered a colorful outfit while his wife, Monica Meacci, stuck with an all-white look. Hastings was seen talking with Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, pictured at left here. Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, was also in attendance at the conference. Silver was seen carrying notes and a laptop as he walked around the conference grounds. Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took a phone call between sessions. Duolingo cofounder Luis von Ahn sported a casual look at the conference. Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp., the media conglomerate founded by Rupert Murdoch, wore jeans and plaid over a graphic tee. He accessorized with bracelets and a black News Corp hat. Jump to

Title: The Hottest VC Deals Today Are No Revenue, No Product, Just All-Star AI Teams And Mega Rounds

ByJosipa Majic Predin ByJosipa Majic Predin, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 06: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event ... More on November 06, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Altman delivered the keynote address at the first-ever Open AI DevDay conference. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The artificial intelligence industry just witnessed one of the most dramatic market distortions in Silicon Valley history. When former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s six-month-old startup Thinking Machines Lab successfully raised 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation, it crystallized a fundamental shift in how AI companies compete for talent. But this astronomical funding round isn’t just about one company’s ambitions - it's the direct result of a compensation arms race that began with Meta's desperate hundred-million-dollar recruiting spree. The pattern is unmistakable: Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised 1 billion dollars at a five billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab secured 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation for a company that’s existed for just 6 months. These aren’t isolated incidents-they represent the new normal in AI investing, where talent portfolios command unicorn valuations before building anything tangible. The story begins with Meta’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta began offering signing bonuses as high as 100 million dollars to poach top researchers from his company. Meta offered employees of rival OpenAI signing bonuses of 100 million dollars to switch companies, with even larger annual compensation packages. While later reports clarified that no one was really getting a hundred million dollar "signing bonus", the psychological impact on the market was immediate and profound. The timing of Meta’s recruitment blitz was strategic. As AI capabilities rapidly advanced and competition intensified, Mark Zuckerberg recognized that talent, not just capital, would determine market leadership. "The List" includes five ex-OpenAI employees as Meta looks to build reasoning models to contend with rivals, highlighting the systematic nature of this talent acquisition campaign. Meta’s compensation strategy created an unintended consequence that reverberated throughout Silicon Valley. When established companies couldn’t match these astronomical packages, they inadvertently set a new baseline for AI talent expectations. Every engineer who heard about hundred-million-dollar offers - even if they didn’t receive them - began to recalibrate their own market value. This is where Murati’s funding round becomes particularly significant. Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a 2 billion dollar seed round at a 10 billion dollar valuation. With this valuation, offering 1% equity to a senior engineer effectively provides the same hundred-million-dollar package that Meta was dangling, but with potentially unlimited upside. The mathematics are stark: in a market where top talent expects hundred-million-dollar packages, startups need billion-dollar valuations just to compete. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional equity-based compensation models where early employees accepted lower salaries in exchange for potentially valuable stock options. This phenomenon extends beyond Murati’s success. The venture capital ecosystem has fundamentally shifted its evaluation criteria for AI startups. Traditional metrics like revenue, user growth, and product-market fit have been replaced by team pedigree, publication records, and previous company affiliations. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence exemplifies this trend, raising 1 billion dollars at a 5 billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product or service. The mathematics behind these investments reflect a new understanding of value creation in AI. When a single breakthrough algorithm can generate tens of billions in market value, investors are essentially purchasing lottery tickets with extraordinarily high potential payoffs. The team becomes the product, and their collective expertise represents the company's entire value proposition. The current landscape reveals clear winners and losers in this talent war. Established tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft can absorb massive compensation costs as operating expenses. Well-funded AI startups with venture capital backing can inflate their valuations to offer competitive equity packages. However, mid-sized companies and traditional enterprises find themselves increasingly priced out of the AI talent market. The pattern is consistent across multiple high-profile cases. Companies like Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines Lab represent a new category of “talent unicorns” - startups valued primarily on their human capital rather than their technological assets. This shift forces traditional businesses to compete not just on product features or market positioning, but on their ability to attract and retain the small pool of elite AI researchers who command these premium valuations. The AI talent market now operates under fundamentally different rules than the broader tech industry. While traditional software companies might offer senior engineers packages worth two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand dollars annually, AI companies routinely offer multimillion-dollar packages for similar roles. This disparity creates several strategic challenges for companies across the ecosystem. First, it forces non-AI companies to either dramatically increase compensation or risk losing technical talent to AI-focused competitors. Second, it creates internal equity issues when AI engineers command significantly higher compensation than equally skilled colleagues in other domains. The talent war has also accelerated the trend toward specialized AI roles. Companies are no longer just hiring "software engineers" but specifically recruiting "AI researchers," "ML engineers," and "AI safety specialists" at premium rates. This specialization further fragments the talent pool and drives up costs. Beyond individual companies, this compensation inflation has broader economic implications. It concentrates high-skilled talent in a narrow set of companies and geographic regions, potentially limiting innovation in other sectors. The astronomical valuations required to compete for AI talent also create potential bubble conditions, where companies are valued based on their ability to attract talent rather than their actual business prospects. The phenomenon also raises questions about resource allocation efficiency. When companies spend billions primarily to secure talent rather than develop products, it suggests that the current market structure may be creating significant inefficiencies. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has reportedly doubled the amount of funding she's seeking to raise for her startup Thinking Machines Lab, indicating that even initial funding targets proved insufficient to compete effectively. The current talent war raises fundamental questions about long-term sustainability. While venture capital markets can support inflated valuations in the short term, companies ultimately need to deliver returns that justify these investments. The pressure to monetize AI capabilities quickly may lead to rushed product launches or over-promising on technological capabilities. Some industry observers argue that the current compensation levels are unsustainable and will eventually correct. However, the unique nature of AI talent—where individual contributors can have outsized impact on company success—suggests that premium compensation may persist longer than in other technology sectors. The international dimension adds another layer of complexity. While US companies engage in bidding wars for AI talent, international competitors may gain advantages by accessing talent pools with different compensation expectations. This could potentially shift the geographic center of AI innovation over time. The AI talent war represents more than just competitive hiring-it reflects the industry's belief that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the global economy. Companies are essentially placing multi-billion-dollar bets on their ability to attract and retain the individuals who will build these transformative technologies. Meta's hundred-million-dollar signing bonuses were intended to solve a specific recruitment problem. Instead, they created a market distortion that forced every other AI company to compete at similar levels. Mira Murati's two-billion-dollar funding round at a ten-billion-dollar valuation represents the logical conclusion of this arms race: when talent becomes the primary constraint on growth, companies will pay whatever it takes to secure it. The question now is whether this new paradigm will drive breakthrough innovations that justify the enormous investments, or whether it represents a misallocation of resources that will eventually require correction. Either way, the AI talent war has permanently altered the landscape of Silicon Valley compensation, creating new rules that extend far beyond the artificial intelligence industry itself. For now, one thing is certain: in the battle for AI supremacy, reputable AI talent has become the ultimate currency, and the price of that currency continues to climb.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed amid tariff uncertainty

Wednesday, 09 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as investors weighed escalating trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump against bullish revisions to Wall Street's outlook for the rest of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 165.60 points, or 0.37 percent, to 44,240.76. The S&P 500 sank 4.46 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,225.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 5.95 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,418.46. Six of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer staples and utilities leading the laggards by losing 1.09 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the gainers by rising 2.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Trump reiterated his Aug. 1 deadline for finalizing trade deals, writing in a Truth Social post that "no extensions will be granted." At a Cabinet meeting later in the day, he announced a 50-percent tariff on copper imports, sending copper prices surging 13 percent to a record high. He also floated potential tariffs as high as 200 percent on pharmaceuticals and said he might notify the European Union within two days of new penalties if a deal is not reached. Trump's aggressive tone came on the heels of letters sent Monday to 14 mostly Asian countries outlining duties scheduled to take effect next month. Despite the tough rhetoric, market reaction was relatively muted. "If people believed it, we'd be down several percentage points," said market analyst Tom Essaye. "The fact that we're not means nobody believes it." He noted that while sentiment was extremely bearish in the spring, the market has become vulnerable to negative surprises now that indexes are hovering near all-time highs. In contrast to trade concerns, two major investment banks boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets. Bank of America raised its target to 6,300, citing solid corporate earnings and resilient consumer spending. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 6,600 from 6,100, although chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned that the recent tech-driven rally has narrowed market breadth to its lowest level since 2023. In equity moves, major technology shares were mixed. Tesla rose 1.32 percent as the stock rebounded from Monday's drop following news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched a new political party. Meta Platforms and Apple inched higher, while Microsoft and Broadcom edged slightly lower. Amazon declined more than 1 percent despite kicking off its Prime Day sales event, and Alphabet also slipped about 1 percent. Nvidia was up 1.11 percent after it got a price target bump from Citi on 'Sovereign AI' demand surge. Market attention is turning to Wednesday's release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting. "This last policy meeting probably was a bit more contentious than the prior meeting in May," said Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options. "There probably was a lot of discussion about when the next rate cut is going to be, so that's going to be important to help move markets along." Thank you for your report!

Title: 10 Prime Day Deals We Expect To Sell Out Before Day One Ends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2025/07/08/prime-day-deals/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T17:46:53Z
Full Content:
As someone who’s been working as a shopping editor for over six years, I’ve come to know the ins and outs of Prime Day—from spotting genuinely good deals (and avoiding the bad ones) to predicting which products will sell out the fastest. For the first time ever, the sale will span four days, which means stock on popular items may be even more limited than years past. To help you find the best Prime Day deals on day one, I’ve curated a list of hot-ticket items expected to be among the first to go, including the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects and the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, both of which are at all-time low prices. These are the 10 Prime Day deals our deals editor predicts will sell out on day one. If you come across my curated list a little late (these products do tend to sell out quickly), I recommend heading straight to Amazon’s “Today’s Big Deals” or “Lightning Deals” sections. That’s where you’ll find the steepest markdowns on hundreds of buzz-worthy items. In any case, check out all my editor-approved Prime Day deals for day one before stock runs out. Amazon Any product with a viral following tends to sell out fast during Prime Day—and this Stanley tumbler is one of them. For context, every time the cup is released in a new colorway, stock typically runs out in minutes. So the fact that it’s majorly discounted right now leads me to believe it’ll fly off the shelves before the day (or even next hour) is over. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price it’s ever dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Year after year, the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask proves to be a top-seller during Prime Day. If you’re already hooked on its buttery-soft, hydrating formula, this is a good time to stock up. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the standard discount we’ve seen during Prime Day in the past. Amazon These whitening strips are another hot commodity during Prime Day—we often see thousands of boxes sell during the sale event. They’re also a team favorite, earning a spot in our shopping guide for the best teeth whitening kits. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. Amazon Prime Day is a great opportunity to find steep discounts on popular smartwatch models, like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Track your fitness routine, curate better sleep habits and monitor key stats like energy level and heart rate, all from this sleek design. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price the smartwatch has dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Similar to Stanley, Yeti is a popular brand shoppers flock to during major sale events. While plenty of Yeti designs are marked down right now, this portable cooler will come in especially handy during summer—whether you’re lounging at the park or heading to the beach. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the first time this Yeti cooler has gone on sale at Amazon. Amazon If you’ve got your eye on electronics from top brands, it’s best to check out sooner rather than later. These Bluetooth headphones are a frequent best-seller on Amazon—over 2,000 pairs were sold in the last month alone—so they’ll likely go quickly while they’re discounted to an all-time low price. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the best deal we’ve ever spotted on the earbuds at Amazon. Amazon In all my years covering Prime Day, I’ve noticed Apple AirPods 2 (alongside other models from the brand) are always among the first to sell out. It’s no surprise—they’re a staple for Apple users, whether they’re upgrading from an older model or replacing a lost pair. Why It’s A Good Deal: This price is $10 cheaper than what we saw over Black Friday. Amazon Nearly all sizes of the Samsung Frame TV—32-inch, 43-inch, 50-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch—are currently sitting at all-time low prices. This is a rare opportunity to finally splurge on the chic, smart TV—there’s no telling when it will go on sale again (or sell out). Why It’s A Good Deal: These are the best discounts we’ve ever come across on this smart TV. Amazon LED face masks are an investment, so it’s often wise to bide your time until a major sale event arrives. The HigherDose Red Light Therapy Face Mask is one of the more popular designs out there—and our top pick for the best LED face mask for comfort. It combines red and near-infrared light to target signs of aging, dullness and uneven tone. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the typical discount we’ve spotted during major sale events, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon While it might not seem like the steepest markdown at first glance, the Meta Quest 3 hardly ever goes on sale, making this a rare chance to snag the popular virtual reality device. This Amazon-exclusive Cardboard Hero bundle includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor and 1,000 shiny rocks to use in the Gorilla Tag game. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price this MetaQuest 3 bundle has dropped to at Amazon.

The market dip deepened as Tesla shares plunged 7% following Elon Musk’s America Party announcement. Futures for Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq also dropped further on Tuesday. Meanwhile, uncertainty around trade deals with India and the European Union and rising US Dollar index added to the pressure. With the new tariffs set to take effect on August 1, investors remain cautious. Read full story for detailed updates.

The Verge’s favorite deals from Amazon’s four-day sales event, from earbuds and video games to robot vacuums and more. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Day one of Prime Day is in the books. The good news? Almost all of the great deals survived the night, and we’re monitoring them all right here in our Prime Day day two post. As such, the post below will no longer be updated. Original article follows below. Prime Day, Amazon’s four-day thunderdome of exclusive deals, is here. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be the best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing them down to include products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for. To repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible. The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. Read our review. The latest pair of Beats earbuds are a no-brainer for athletes. They pack fantastic sound and thumping bass, along with active noise cancellation, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. Read our review. Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones, which replace the QuietComfort 45, have adjustable noise cancellation and the ability to set custom modes. However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Samsung’s premium Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sport the same stem-based design and pinch gestures as the standard Galaxy Buds 3, only they deliver better sound, improved ANC, and an in-ear fit with silicone tips. Read our review. Sony’s last-last-gen ANC headphones still offer great sound, last up to 30 hours on a single charge, and provide a comfortable listening experience thanks to their plush ear pads. Read our review. The Beats Studio Buds Plus offer better sound and noise cancellation than the original pair, and they now come in a unique translucent color option. Read our review.

Shokz’ best bone conduction headphones yet, with more booming bass than its predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review. A Qi2 pad on the front and a party in the back, with three AC outlets and four USB ports. It can deliver up to 67W through a single USB-C port or divided between its two USB-C and two USB-A ports. Anker’s jack-of-all-trades travel adapter packs enough ports to refill your devices during some downtime. It features one AC outlet, two USB-C ports (one tops out at 20W), and two USB-A ports. It’s not the fastest wall charger, but it’s a solid choice when you can find it at a discount. Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. The charger includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its five-foot / 1.5m USB cable. A compact, flexible Qi2 charger for vent and dash mounting. Read our review. Baseus’ slick USB-C charger supports 100W passthrough and takes a puck-like form when not in use, with male connectors on either side that retract inward with a quick tug.

It’s thinner and lighter than its predecessors, yet it charges faster and features the same fitness and wellness features. Read our review. The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.

The Oura Ring 4 is slimmer and more accurate than its predecessor, while adding new AI-powered tools and longer battery life. Read our review. The Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment. Read our review. The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen. It lacks built-in GPS, contactless payments, and digital assistants, but offers a range of other excellent health and fitness tracking features. Read our impressions. Google’s Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display than its predecessor, along with a Tensor G4 processor, a bigger battery, 12GB of RAM, and a dual rear camera setup with a new 48-megapixel sensor for its ultrawide. Read our review. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an eight-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold. The new foldable also lies flat when opened, sports IPX8 weather resistance, and offers a thinner design than the last-gen model. Read our review. The OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price. Read our review. The Galaxy S25 Edge offers a big screen without all the heft of a typical big phone. Battery life is just okay, and the phone lacks a telephoto camera, but otherwise, it’s a remarkable device. Read our review. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is still one of the best phones you can buy, even if its “Ultra”-ness is a little diminished. Two telephotos, a built-in stylus, and a big screen are the main attractions. Read our review. The Galaxy A35 5G comes with a good 6.6-inch OLED panel, a robust IP67 dust and water resistance rating, and a strong software update policy for its class. The standard Moto Razr features a 6.9-inch inner screen, accompanied by a larger 3.6-inch cover screen. Wired charging tops out at 30W, compared to the Razr Plus’ 45W, although it features 15W wireless charging, up from 5W on the previous model. Read our review. The MacBook Air is Apple’s budget-friendly laptop from 2020. It comes outfitted with the company’s M1 chip, which offers terrific performance, even if it’s not as fast as Apple’s newer models. It also sports all-day battery life, Touch ID, and MagSafe charging. Read our review. The latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence. Unlike its predecessor, the base model now offers 16GB RAM by default, along with a new 12-megapixel webcam. Read our review.

Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus with 64GB of storage is $139.99 (originally $219.99), beating its previous best price of $149. Despite its low price, the Tab A9 Plus retains a high-end look, and its 11-inch screen makes it a great option for watching movies and TV shows. The Boox Palma 2 is a 6.3-inch smartphone-sized e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more. Read our review. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display. It also boasts 32GB of storage, waterproofing, and support for wireless charging. Read our review. Google’s 11-inch Pixel Tablet uses the same Tensor G2 chip found in the Pixel 7 lineup. It also features a crisp LCD display and a four-speaker sound array. Read our review. Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review. Google’s excellent TV Streamer 4K is its best attempt at a streaming device yet, offering built-in ethernet along with smart home compatibility with Matter and Thread. Read our review. Amazon’s latest streaming stick is faster than its predecessor with Wi-Fi 6E and double the storage. It also now displays widgets and artwork when idle while continuing to offer Alexa integration. LG’s B4 might be one of the cheapest OLED TVs available, but it still offers plenty of bang for your buck — including four HDMI 2.1 ports, speedy performance, and five years’ worth of webOS updates. TCL’s Mini LED QLED TV is a great value, particularly for those who want a fast frame rate and a bright picture. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate, features two HDMI 2.1 ports, and supports Google TV’s robust software. Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV uses an anti-glare matte QLED display, which can showcase artwork and photos with canvas-like quality when idle. Bargain hunters seeking a large, yet reasonably priced, 65-inch OLED TV should consider Samsung’s S85D. It’s Samsung’s entry-level model, though you still get HDMI 2.1 ports, 4K resolution at 120Hz with consoles, and a variable refresh rate. iFFALCON’s slim-bezeled mural TV takes after Samsung’s Frame TV, but costs significantly less. The TCL sub-brand’s TV sports an art mode and several high-end features, including a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price. This ultrawide (21:9) QHD OLED gaming monitor has a 165Hz refresh rate, a fast response time, and a slick design. It’s tough to get more OLED for your money than with this model when it’s discounted. The newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera.

Luckily, Bissell’s relatively compact cleaner does a great job of restoring fabrics to their original sheen with just a little elbow grease. This battery has the juice, so to speak, and quite a lot of it. Its main role is to be available to jumpstart a car battery (12V/1000A), but it has USB ports, too, making it handy for charging other devices you bring in the car.

Title: $30 billion blast-off: Why Rocket Lab just hit an all-time high and the 32,000 Kiwis along for the ride

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck at his firm's mission control room in Auckland. Photo / Dean Purcell Rocket Lab shares jumped 9.03% today to US$38.88, giving the Nasdaq-listed, Kiwi-American firm an all-time high valuation of US$17.94 billion ($30.48b). Forbes accordingly bumped founder Sir Peter Beck’s estimated wealth (based on his 10.5% Rocket Lab stake) by 9% or US$164m to US$2.0b on its real-time net-worth tracker. While most of Beck’s wealth is tied up in his firm, he sold a parcel of shares worth US$20.2m in 2023 to capitalise his charitable foundation. The former Fisher and Paykel Appliances apprentice has also invested in numerous Kiwi start-ups at key points in their life, including Halter, Partly, Foundry Lab, Astrix Astronautics and HeartLab. It’s not just about Beck’s bank account, however. When Rocket Lab began its bull run midway through last year, Sharesies said around 20,000 Kiwis owned shares in the firm through its fractional ownership platform. This morning, co-founder Leighton Roberts said the number has hit 32,000. The average buy price in the volatile stock is US$12.76, Roberts says. Sharesies also recently added Rocket Lab to the list of US stocks eligible for its self-select KiwiSaver scheme, which sees customers choose a base fund, with the option to add various individual stocks or exchange-traded funds. “Several hundred” self-select customers had already added Rocket Lab to their KiwiSaver mix, Roberts told the Herald. Rocket Lab’s share price is now running ahead of analysts’ valuations. According to a Wall Street Journal summary, there are 10 analysts with a “buy” rating on Rocket Lab, with one “overweight” and four giving the stock a “hold”. None of the 15 analysts covering the stock have an “underweight” or “sell” rating. The average 12-month target price is US$32.18 (with a low of US$20.00 and a high of US$45.00). Two interrelated factors are behind the stock’s recent surge. One is SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s fallout with Donald Trump - which has seen the US President withdraw the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to be the new head of Nasa (the US space agency being one of the biggest customers of both SpaceX and Rocket Lab). Trump has also threatened to cancel SpaceX’s Government contracts. At the same time, Rocket Lab is building up to the first test launch of its much larger, crew-capable rocket, the Neutron - which will put it toe to toe with SpaceX for the first time. Rocket Lab has started to sign up the first Neutron customers to its US$1b-plus order book, which was opened after the US election in late 2024. Key clients, including various defence agencies, want competition. Things looked darker as Musk emerged as Trump’s right-hand man, at the same time as SpaceX was pushing for billions more in Federal funding. Now, the stars are more aligned to Beck’s firm. While Neutron will only launch from the US, the giant new rocket forms only half of Rocket Lab’s growth story. The firm is also banking on further growth in its space systems business, including satellite components being manufactured at its expanded Auckland facility. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX - buoyed at the time by Musk’s then-close relationship with Elon Musk - had a US$350b private equity valuation. Beck’s company is the only other private player to stage regular launches, but Musk’s firm is still far ahead. SpaceX, which also owns the Starlink satellite network, staged 138 launches in 2024 to Rocket Lab’s 16. Jeff Bezos’ New Origin - currently best-known for its near-space tourist jaunts - is also gearing up for a medium-lift push. Things have also turned out better than originally anticipated for US solar and wind farm operator Longroad Energy, 37% owned by NZX-listed Infratil. Jarden analysts said the final form of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” was less bad for the clean energy sector than Infratil had anticipated. Arie Dekker and Grant Swanepoel maintained their buy rating and hiked Infratil’s 12-month target price from $10.77 to $14.31 (shares were recently trading at $10.96 (other recent developments have included a 1% fall in CDC’s independent valuation and chief executive Jason Boyes buying $1.25m worth of stock). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provided US$369 billion ($621b) to spur green infrastructure and decarbonisation, was a Biden centrepiece. Trump campaigned on a promise to gut the legislation, which he called “the green scam”, and withhold US$104b in IRA funds yet to be allocated. In its last annual report, written before Trump’s election, Infratil took a punt on political commentary. “More than 80% of the investment in large-scale clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing pledged since the passage of the IRA and the Chips and Science Act will go to Republican congressional districts. Even if Republicans controlled the Federal government, many in the party may view reversing the IRA as too politically risky.” That turned out to be largely prescient. The original “Big Beautiful Bill” gave energy firms 60 days after its passing to begin new projects, thus securing IRA tax credits. Now, after watering down in the Senate, the final “Big Beautiful Bill” gives Longroad and its peers 12 months to start a new project. It’s a complex set-up but Jarden’s read is that Longroad and its peers will be able to “safe harbour” or claim full IRA tax credits until “well beyond 2027″. For Boston-based Longroad - Infratil’s third-largest asset after CDC and One NZ, with a $2.1b fair value - those new projects will include a contract with Meta, signed in December, to supply the Facebook owner with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity to support its data centre operations. It’s a similar story for Allbirds, with its Trump impact bad, but a lot less bad than it initially seemed. In May, Allbirds - the producer of sustainable footwear and activewear made from New Zealand merino wool, co-founded by ex-All White Tim Brown - reported another big loss and another big fall in revenue. But it forecast a return to revenue growth in the final quarter of this year, subject to no more external shocks - and Vietnam, home to nearly all of its manufacturing, succeeding in keeping tariffs on its exports to the US at a 10% “pause” level, rather than the 46% initially slapped on the country on Trump’s “Liberation Day”. A US-Vietnam preliminary trade deal announced overnight set a 20% tariff for Vietnam imports (compared to a pre-Trump average of 10%). Allbirds had braced for the worst, announcing a new US$75m revolving credit facility on June 30. The firm had no immediate statement but its need to draw on the new credit line seems less pressing now than anticipated. Its shares, which dived to US$4.39 after “Liberation Day” have staged a sharp recovery over recent weeks and were recently trading at US$10.54.

Title: Can Nvidia Stock Hit $200 By The End Of 2025?

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Any dip in Nvidia stock is most likely a buying opportunity. This article isn’t about Nvidia’s parabolic rise amid the AI boom. It won’t dwell on the well-known fact that Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 90% of AI data centers worldwide or that tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta remain deeply invested in its silicon innovations. It’s not even about CUDA, Nvidia’s giant competitive moat that is still relevant today. Nor will we focus on how the stock struggled earlier this year, as investors kept raising the bar, until even spectacular results weren’t good enough. And yet, Nvidia has not only reclaimed its top spot, it is trading at record highs. The trillion-dollar question now is: Can Nvidia stock reach $200 by year-end? Or is that a stretch even for a strong compounder like the AI bellwether? On June 25, 2025, Nvidia surged over 4%, closing at a record $154.31, reclaiming its spot as the most valuable publicly traded company (~$3.77 trillion market cap), surpassing Microsoft and Apple. The stock is even higher now, and the last closing price is $159.34, marking a stellar comeback, from Nvidia’s April 4th closing low of $94.30. Nvidia stock erased more than 40% of its value between February and April of this year, not because of any failing on its part. Concerns over moderating AI spending, and unpredictable tariff policies triggered the decline. This is not Nvidia’s first rodeo either. Prior to that, DeepSeek revelations in late January created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day. The market was simply recalibrating its perception of perfection. While DeepSeek showed promise, it is nowhere in the leagues of an established AI leader like Nvidia. So, the sell-off was unjustified in my opinion. The Nvidia stock bounced back within a month. Last year too, Nvidia shares fell nearly 23% from mid-July through early August, closing August 7th trade at $98.88. The sell-off was triggered by fears that Nvidia’s big tech customers may trim their AI spending budgets. However, Nvidia stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at nearly $130. Every time a quality stock drops, the internet floods with "Should you buy the dip?" takes. My view is simple: Study the cause. If the sell-off happened for reasons that can be fixed – go ahead and buy. But if it stems from deeper, structural weaknesses, then walk away. It’s not like there’s only one good stock out there. Nvidia’s deeply integrated AI ecosystem gives it a wide berth over competition, and its innovation remains unsurpassed. Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. That said, investor perception is everything when it comes to stock pricing. The recent rally has given reason to hope that the market may be finally waking up to the true value of this stock following a period of inflated expectations and sharp corrections.The fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to keep the buying pressure active and drive NVDA to at least $180 by the end of this year. Of course, I could be wrong. China is a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened dramatically from 95% before 2022, to 50% currently, after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. To comply with the U.S. export curbs, Nvidia has been selling H20 to China. H20 is a watered-down version of its H100 chips with significantly lower computing power. However, in April, the U.S. government tightened restrictions again, reclassifying even the scaled-down H20 as requiring an export license. The decision effectively halted shipments and dealt Nvidia a serious financial blow. CEO Jensen Huang put it bluntly: “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.” Calling the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market “effectively closed to the U.S. industry,” Huang also warned that if U.S. export restrictions continue, more Chinese customers will turn to Huawei's chips. I highlighted this risk in a previous article that flagged both the threat of an H20 ban and Huawei’s preparation for competitive positioning, citing Jefferies and WSJ reports. Nvidia recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue prior to April 9, before the new export restrictions kicked in. The financial fallout from the ban was significant. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in unsold H20 inventory for the first quarter, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of what would have been H20-generated revenue. Gross margin fell to 61%, versus the 71.3% it would have reported without the China-related charges. In an interview with the Stratechery podcast in May, Huang also revealed the company had to walk away from an additional $15 billion of sales. The topline guidance of $45 billion for the July quarter, would have been higher by $8 billion, but for the new export restrictions. So, why is there still hope for a China rebound for Nvidia? Nvidia is pivoting swiftly. A Reuters report citing sources familiar to the matter said Nvidia is planning to build a GPU or graphics processing unit for China based on its latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors that will be priced at $6,500-8,000, well below the H20’s price range of $10,000-$12,000. The lower price could reflect the new export limits on GPU memory bandwidth – a metric crucial for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Also, recent developments suggest a thaw in the U.S.’s formerly hardline stance against China, signaling a broader shift in tone This gives rise to a key question: In this more conciliatory phase, is there any possibility that the U.S. could revisit its chip export restrictions to China as well? The New York Times reported on June 27th that China confirmed details of a trade framework with the Trump administration. “China will review and approve applications for the export of controlled items,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, and “the United States will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures it has taken against China.” While specifics remain vague, the framework hints at a meaningful de-escalation. The most compelling driver behind this shift? Not a change of heart, just China’s dominance in rare earth elements – critical for semiconductors, robotics and aerospace applications. This accord between the U.S. and China, includes the latter’s commitment to deliver rare earth, in exchange for the U.S. lifting its export curbs on ethane, chip software and jet engines. As trade talks evolve, Beijing is not above deploying its rare earth “Trump card” to reopen access to restricted U.S. AI chip technologies. If the U.S. should revise or relax chip export policies or greenlight a new line of compliant processors, Nvidia could regain access to the highly lucrative market. Such a development would materially bolster the case for Nvidia hitting $200 by year’s end. However, even without China, Nvidia remains on solid footing, thanks to its ability to innovate relentlessly. Nvidia’s growth story is deeply structural, spanning beyond GPUs to hyperscaler ramp-ups, AI factories, sovereign AI, Networking, gaming, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. Nvidia isn’t just firing on all cylinders – it is building entirely new growth engines. Blackwell’s Blockbuster Ramp: In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia’s data center revenue surged 73% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $39 billion, with compute revenue accounting for $34.2 billion, up 76% y-o-y. At the heart of this explosive growth lies Blackwell, the fastest-ramping architecture in Nvidia’s history. AI Factories and Sovereign AI: As nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack, Sovereign AI is a solid growth engine for the AI bellwether. Nvidia has sovereign AI deals in place with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. AI factory build-outs are driving significant revenue for Nvidia with deployments at AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek and Telenor. The count of Nvidia-powered AI factories doubled y-o-y to roughly 100 in the first quarter, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. Nvidia’s new Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics switches will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs. These switches offer 3.5x greater power efficiency, 10x higher network resiliency and accelerate customer time-to-market by 1.3x. Other revenue drivers: This brings us to networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia with first-quarter networking revenue reaching nearly $5 billion, up 56% y-o-y and 64% sequentially. Networking growth was driven by NVLink, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. Also helping networking growth is the continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions. Spectrum X – which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI – is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue with deployments across Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Meta, Google Cloud and xAI. For AI-powered cybersecurity – Checkpoint, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA’s AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows. CrowdStrike, for instance, has achieved 2x faster detection triage with 50% fewer compute resources. Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record $3.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of the Blackwell architecture. Professional Visualization revenue, which includes Nvidia Omniverse, rose 19% from a year ago to $509 million, thanks to broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation. Automotive and Robotics revenue rose 72% to $567 million from a year ago, driven by sales of Nvidia’s self-driving platforms. Most recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company’s next biggest growth opportunity after AI, noting that self-driving cars are likely to be the first major commercial application of this technology. Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as expensive as it is touted to be. Some valuation metrics suggest room for upside: Interestingly, those discount levels align closely with the roughly 25-30% upside Nvidia would need to reach $200. That leaves the question less about if Nvidia can reach $200 and more about when investors will be ready to price that in. So, what are analysts saying about the Nvidia stock? Nvidia currently has a “Strong Buy” rating with a 12-month price target of $174 per share. Loop Capital lifted its price target for Nvidia to $250 from $175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. The rating firm’s client note said, "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.” Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating with a $200 target, citing robust fundamentals and strong growth expectations through 2025 and especially in 2026. A few Bumps on Nvidia's road to $200 include: Bottom line In my opinion, Nvidia stock is likely to reach at least $180 by year-end, supported by a re-rating in its forward PEG to around 1.47, if market sentiment continues to remain constructive. Key catalysts will be earnings announcements for the rest of the year, but it all boils down to market perception. Nvidia can continue to generate stellar results, and if that fails to align with already-high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could pause or pull back. That said, for the long-term, Nvidia is a structural compounder with deeply embedded growth levers and robust AI tailwinds. Any dip in the stock is most likely a buying opportunity. If there is any change in China export policy, the Nvidia stock could achieve its $180 target even sooner and be well on its way to $200 by year-end.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is upping the ante in the AI business, triggering a bidding war for talent and he’s willing to poach from competitors. Why? Well, like most of us, Mark is in hot pursuit of Godlike super intelligence. pic.twitter.com/0MqEqiiKpK — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Perfectly rational man in a perfectly rational society that has truly mastered rational resource allocation. pic.twitter.com/H58LvHoh7S — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Ed Zitron summed up Zuckerberg’s recent moves and his overall strategy: Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, my previous subject in this King Idiots of AI mini-series squealed like a stuck pig: pic.twitter.com/LXfthZ4STJ — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 I really should quote a little from the NY Times piece I referenced above: In April, Meta released two new versions of Llama, asserting that the models performed as well as or better than comparable ones from OpenAI and Google. To prove its claim, Meta cited its own testing benchmarks. On Instagram, Mr. Zuckerberg championed the releases in a video selfie. But some independent researchers quickly deduced that Meta’s benchmarks were designed to make one of its models look more advanced than it was. They became incensed. Mr. Zuckerberg later learned that his A.I. team had wanted the models to appear to perform well, even though they were not doing as well as hoped, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Zuckerberg was not briefed on the customized tests and was upset, two people said. His solution was to throw more bodies at the problem. Meta’s A.I. division swelled to more than 1,000 people this year, up from a few hundred two years earlier. The rapid growth led to infighting and management squabbles. And with Mr. Zuckerberg’s round-the-clock, hard-charging management style — his attention on a project is often compared to the “Eye of Sauron” internally, a reference to the “Lord of the Rings” villain — some engineers burned out and left. Executives hunkered down to brainstorm next steps, including potentially ratcheting back investment in Llama. In fairness to Meta, the NYT failed to mention that Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that it’s “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” And if you can’t trust the fine folks at Meta, who can you trust? But I don’t want to dismiss Zuckerberg too cavalierly. I’m a serial sucker taking things at face value, investing based on business fundamentals and underlying product value, and betting on professional wrestling. He’s a stone playa who read the true nature of this society at a very early age, from The Harvard Crimson, 2003: The creator of the short-lived but popular Harvard version of the Am I Hot or Not? website said he will not have to leave school after being called before the Administrative Board yesterday afternoon. Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 said he was accused of breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com, about two weeks ago. The charges were based on a complaint from the computer services department over his unauthorized use of on-line facebook photographs, he said. Zuckerberg said he will not be forced to withdraw or leave school for any amount of time, but declined to elaborate on whether the board took some lesser action. …“I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson earlier this month. After taking it down, Zuckerberg decided that criticism of the site was too strong to re-post it. “Issues about violating people’s privacy don’t seem to be surmountable,” he wrote at that point. “I’m not willing to risk insulting anyone.” The site was created entirely by Zuckerberg over the last week in October, after a friend gave him the idea. The website used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person. Students were ranked within the general Harvard community and individual Houses according to attractiveness. Zuckerberg hacked into House websites to gather the photos, and then wrote the codes to compute rankings after every vote. The programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg’s primary interest in creating it, he said. After creating the website, Zuckerberg forwarded the link to a few friends for advice. But the link then was sent out on several campus group list-serves, and traffic skyrocketed. In the course of one day, the number of visitors quadrupled—by 10 p.m., the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times. The part I love about the story above is the way Zuckerberg is the only source quoted. Those Harvard educated journalists are allowed to be awful from the get. She also didn’t report the blog post he put up the night he launched the site: “I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. By the time of his 2018 congressional testimony Zuck had gotten some press training: Zuckerberg, 33, paused and smirked. “No, congressman. FaceMash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,” he said. “You put up two pictures of two women and decided which one was the better, more attractive of the two, is that right?” Long asked. Zuckerberg responded, with an emphasis on his youth at the time: “That is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was a sophomore in college.” Ok, so he’s always been ruthless, shrewd and openly anti-social but I’m not sure he’s really that smart. Social media had been pioneered by MySpace, Friendster and several other companies long before Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea for Facebook from classmates. Facebook primarily rose to the top because of three factors: Since launching Facebook, his biggest wins have come from buying budding competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp more than from any internally created ideas. Never forget, this is the same guy who spent $47 billion in five years on “the Metaverse.” He clearly cannot tell a good idea from a bad one. He’s explained his recent AI spending spree to investors (who have no ability to depose him) in April: “The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do.” At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs. What Zuckerberg didn’t say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. “Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he’s not going to be stopped,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC’s “Money Movers.” Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they’re building.” I had to include the hypersonic quote from D.A. that CNBC featured. I’m sure it made great TV. It wouldn’t be American corporate media if it didn’t feature interchangeable hustlers competing to spout the most ridiculous nonsense in the most simplistic terms. They’re all like a TV sportscaster talking to drunks at noon on a Sunday except with no contract and an urgent need to be invited back right away. Also making me doubt Zuckerberg’s wisdom was his recent, much publicized decision to hire the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s CEO Dana White to be a board member for a reported seven figure stock and cash compensation package. Although there was some logic behind that decision. From The MMA Draw, a publication aimed at investors in the fight sports industry: This well-planned and well-executed attention-getter kicked off Meta’s 2025 with a bang. That’s right, Meta, a company with a $1.59 TRILLION market cap has brought America’s best-known fight promoter (and wife-beater) on their board of directors. The collective “WTF?!?” spawned headlines and social media posts all over the Internet. Based on this round-up of headlines from Google News, the mainstream media already has a theory and it has to do with a certain newly re-elected President celebrating a big anniversary on January 6th. pic.twitter.com/zQb8SgdvWq — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 It’s also, according to The MMA Draw, part of Zuckerberg personally rebranding himself for the Trump era: Reason #2: Zuck Is Getting Based 2024 saw Mark Zuckerberg embark on what Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called “a wider strategic overhaul of the tech mogul’s public image.” She also explained why Zuckerberg might be doing this: Meta is embroiled in an anti-monopoly lawsuit and is being sued by dozens of states alleging that Facebook and Instagram are exploiting children to boost profits. Far better, don’t you think, that we all talk about how handsome a bearded Zuck would be rather than dwell on Meta’s less attractive business practices? Honestly, it’s been a pretty incredible rebranding campaign for Zuckerberg, scoring wins by showing off his wakeboarding, flag-waving, and beer-drinking mastery. Anyone who remembers Zuckerberg’s pathetic attempt to launch himself as a potential political candidate in 2017 should be impressed by how dramatically he’s improved his PR game. He’s even gotten favorable notice from the Twitter fashion guy. Zuck’s (seemingly genuine) fondness for training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a big part of this rebranding and a great excuse to pal around with Dana White. Zuckerberg been talking up his love for BJJ since at least this 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Mark Zuckerberg on what he loves about BJJ: (It’s) a thing that is both super engaging physically but also intellectually and where you can’t afford to focus on something else. I think (it’s) the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second you’re gonna end up on the bottom. So I’ve just found that is just really important for me in terms of what I do. Being able to maintain my energy level, maintain my focus… then after an hour or two of working out or rolling or wrestling with friends, now I’m ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. Zuckerberg has also medaled in a BJJ tournament and at one point even had Dana White calling up the Roman Colosseum looking for the right venue to host a bout between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Naturally with 2020’s Zuckerberg, even the cage fight was vaporware. Caveat: The Market, aka the most effective price discovery system ever invented disagrees. pic.twitter.com/eGqayBw4If — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. The dual share structure grants him dictatorial powers at Meta, meaning the guy has Imprimatur to do pretty much what he wants, including torching $47bn on what amounted to little more than a personal obsession with the metaverse, memory-holing that episode, and then lining up hundreds of billions more in his continuing quest for a defining “second act” that will secure his place amongst the pantheon of great innovators (as opposed to being known as the guy who stole the idea for facebook from a friend and has since built his empire on strangling emerging competitors in the crib). He’s as desperate for this second act as Trump is for a Nobel Peace Price. His strategy clearly rests on aggregating the critical inputs for AI supremacy ie data (expect Meta’s family of apps to be harvested for every last bit of training data, user privacy be damned), algorithms (Deepseek’s algorithmic breakthroughs shocked SV titans, including MZ, to their core, hence his poaching spree to build bench strength and an AI intellectual aristocracy within Meta to push forward the frontier of algorithmic discovery, which by the way, given Meta’s history, will likely mean just copying whatever the real frontier players are doing) and compute (data centre build out is the sport of kings and given his profligate pursuit of metaverse supremacy, the man can outspend an army of drunken sailors everyday and twice on Sunday). We sure do live in interesting times. https://youtu.be/_v3KiaAjpY8?feature=shared I would recommend this video in full as it does flesh out the whole notion of how one reinvents themselves (or as this video calls it – becoming a new guy) as part of the broadrler topic. It does address Zuck in particular around 42:37. Zuckerberg and the other techbros are looking several steps ahead, but they’re not great at watching their feet. Hey we saw the movie version, Aaron Sorkin on top of every PMC trend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_network It’s not exactly warm and friendly toward Zuck but does seem enamored of Larry Summers. As for Zuckerberg’s trial and error business model that’s so very much a Silicon Valley thing is it not? Musk blows up a giant rocket and just shrugs. break things Contrast with Zuck against say, Bill Gates who quite famously took others ideas or seriously underpaid in hindsight, either is applicable. Good connections and voila, now IBM has a supplier in Microsoft for their software OS on this new idea called the PC…Mark just took the same steps but got to the wealthy billionaire level much quicker. So much to add about my personal experience but I enjoy many of the films directed or helmed by Fincher. Even the occasional dud or a film he disavowed, Alien 3 being a key example. Speaking of the Facebook/Zuck movie, it was recently rated as the 10th best movie of the 21st century by both fans and critics. I mean, I liked the movie OK, but 10th best of the (quarter) century? Not even close, and I don’t watch that many movies. https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/best-movies-21st-century-new-york-times-films-111414429.html I was listening to a podcast about AI and investing. Regardless of what you think about it, it is getting lots of attention from investors that don’t want to be left out. Meaning if you are not investing in it you look like a fool and they will take their money elsewhere. Never mind what China keeps doing with low cost AI. Whether he’s interested or not, he kinda has to go along with the narrative > Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad #NitPick: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Unearned, Magic Money Made Up Via Market Malfeasance After Bad It’s all Unicorn Rainbow Poop, designed via finacial chicanery to become high powered money. All of it, inflated value made real via stock “money”. That’s why he can pelt it around like tennis balls at a summer carnival trying to win prizes. Ugh. It’s family-blogging tragic when you think about it from the perspective of the public good being laid waste to by the US uni-party. And another “inception” subtext to all this is our collective sanitization of the term “billionaire”, and the notion of “a billion dollars”. And absolutely obscene amount of money that could fuel a thousand lifetimes, sadly made acceptable for one person to have in a single lifetime. #GuillotineWatch lost the last of 3 baby geese. and i stepped on a wire or something in the flooded road(tetanus vaxxed)…so my feets are both wrinkled and one is sorta sore. no other casualties. i am alone with the animals on this place. we’re all good. 23″. since thursday afternoon. 7-7-2025 so heres how it happened for me. july 3rd, afternoon, check weather, as usual. Looks like heavy rain and some flooding…so I decide, after evening chores…critters put up, etc…to sit out at the wilderness bar, drinking beer(started w a margarita(likker first!)) and rolled 4 little joints(lack of proper zigzags), and determined to watch the storm…as is my wont…..my fone is filled with vids of these often dramatic events…usually brief. This event didnt turn out to be brief,lol. When im out here, I have my laptop for music and for occupying myself with the web. And also for weather. First place I go when I get up(4am) is NWS and Wundermap, to see whats happening…and then I do this regularly, all day. So I had all my weather shit in one window…so i’m watching the storms IRL, and on the near real time radar. And a brief, relatively minor event, turned into a catastrophe….storms just sat there, dumping rain by the tankerfull…all over from here to kerrville. (turns out I got the most rain from this event…24” on my place, since thursday afternoon…more than kerr cnty..but I dont live on a river, nor have canyons). So I watched it rain…hard. Threw a tarp over the laptop and retreated(quite drunk and high, mind you) to the spots that generally stay dry. And it just kept on raining, superhard. Im from houston, and ive spent a lot of time in a vw van all over the gulf coast, and ive never seen a monsoon, before, save in films. Thats what this was like…bangladesh. So im out here, 5 sheets to the wind(by now, im sipping tequila…because why the hell not?) watching this incredible monsoon hammer down and I remember thinking, “ well, this aint what they predicted”. So I watched and watched…and soon, I heard a sound that I know well…rushing water…like over a rapids at a river. But way out here. It was the road and my almost always dry gully…which is not connected(for 40 years) to any current drainage system in this watershed. I had a pond…but filled with rushing water, calf-high…and so did the road,,,,and it stayed that way for…well…well into the next day(saturday), and I couldnt get to the highway until sunday. Im 20+ miles from the Llano river, maybe 12 from the San Saba. We do flood, due to the hills…but rarely anything like this. But we dont have canyons…and we have more silt…often deep, between the hills, instead of the limestone caliche that they have down there(about 50 miles as crow flies from me, to my southwest) Its now monday evening, july 7th…and it only stopped raining about 4 hours ago. Ive had some breaks…such to pick squash and zukes and a whole lotta green beans to can…and ive been to the highway, to look at the dirt road…torn up, but passable once the water ran off. That was saturday midday, I think,lol. Maybe sunday///it all runs together. \ive had intervals where I could go out and do farmer things…but then it rains again. I was out in the worst of it…thursday night, all day friday….half of that time drunk as a skunk,,,with a headlight, crocs and naked(why get yer clothes wet?) and checking on the critters….and just surveying what was going on. I am currently alone on this place…mom’s been at galveston for a week now, with my brother and his brood. This is NOT how I wanted to spend my vacation from her,lol. I’ve got a leaky house…due to being bad at roofing,lol…so my house is wet and moldy. Take a week of fans and dry weather to even begin. But I aint in kerrville, or comfort, or any of a thousand little wide spots in the road(and real cities, too) who have had it much, much worse than I. I feel for those folks…and recognise immediately many of the places in all the vids out there. I have lived out here in the texas hill country for 30 and a half years, now. I know this place, this area, this region. In that time, ive seen catastrophic floods…more often than not, along the guadalupe. But ive never seen anything as catastrophic as this. Pray, or send $, or sacrifice a chicken or whatever. A hurricane came to the middle of texas. So glad to hear from you and that beyond some very annoying property damage, you came through OK! We missed your comments. It reminded me of childhood when a tooth came out and before the adult tooth erupted you keep noticing the gap. The mouth is functional but incomplete….. that’s probably a stupid analogy but just woke up. Here in middle England we are supposedly about to enter phase 2 of our summer record breaking heatwave. This time round my dad has been a total star and I have portable A/C unit now fully set up with appropriate window covering for exhaust fan set up. Hardly very environmentally friendly but after attending a meetup group of locals and seeing where the mood of this country is taking us, I don’t feel very inclined to do my bit anymore for the next generation. UK entering FAFO phase. glad you are for the most part ok Was hoping you and your’n were ok… and glad to hear it’s so… Glad you survived, what a storm! What a tale to tell… Glad everything is jake~ Glad to hear that you made it though the storm OK. Lots of people were asking after you the past coupla days and were worried about you. Guess that you have a boat load of repairs and work to do now that the storm has abated. You wonder if this will be the last such storm that you will see or if there will be more such storms down the track. #Amen Does the silt retain water that soaks through it? Could this event lead to local groundwater recharge? If so, that could be a future benefit from all this rain right where you are at. It could hold you over somewhat through the long drought to come sooner or later. Has any thought been given ( should any thought be given) to deepening the pond so it can store more water between the occasional super-rains? yes. the deep silt(sandy loam, its called) directly recharges the hickory sand aquifer beneath me. this is why i modified the levies and such in both pastures to divert floods into them, where it can soak in(also feed the deep subsoil, that sits just above a layer of black/gray clay, around 6 foot down.(i dug cores by hand long ago…yes i am a glutton for punishment, as well as a nut for such info) the native prairie grasses(and things like wilman love i planted long ago to stabilise the then sand) have deep, deep roots that…along with the tree roots…poke through that clay strata and allow water to percolate down. down around Kerrville, Fredricksburg, Comfort, etc(all along the Balcones Fault), they have caliche…a limestone and clay sort of dirt…that becomes concrete when theres a drought….that was the situation on july 3rd. that sort of formation is called Karst…and recharge occurs through caves and fractures created over long term by the rain being just acidic enough to eat through the limestone bedrock. so totally different than here. my area is older,as far as the long ago Llano Uplift is concerned….the Karst we have remaining is up on the hill tops, and has to a great extent worn away, leaving the old granite plutons…like Katemcy Rocks, or Enchanted Rock. Theres one of those under every limestone hill you find in the entire Llano Uplift. and the limestone on our hills is old and brittle…unsuited for building, etc. here, between the hills, are deep valleys, filled with silt/sandy loam…on my place, the granite bedrock is around 100-120′ deep. thats where our wells tap in. my neighbor, not 400 yards thataway, has granite not 20′ deep, and has to do rainwater. i ended up with just over 23″, as of this time yesterday. and a large part of that water that flowed on my place, stayed here(pastures are still covered in 4″ of water), and went down. this is why swales and contour plowing are such a big deal, allows the rain to hang around and soak in, leaving yer topsoil in place, rather than carrying it off to the Gulf. biggest impact for me is my house…due to my poor roofing skills,lol. ive been running fans and hauling out the remains of the mess the boys left me when they ran off into their lives, fixin to remove furniture(free and old), etc…and just GI the whole house, so i can spread pinesol on the whole floors, and finally paint them, sometime in august. mold is what im racing against. 1200 sq ft house, so a big job…and i already had too much work and not enough body. thank y’all for askin after me. So glad you’re OK Amfortas… and also glad you’re so handy and will be able to recover. Take good care. Glad you’re OK. Stay safe!
