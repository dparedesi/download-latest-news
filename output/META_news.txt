Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts upgraded their price target for AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) from $108 to $175 in a note Friday, citing optimistic trends in mobile gaming ad spending revealed in their latest survey. The survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground. In their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth. While the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles. "We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks," stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. Moreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025. "APP's user quality and ability to scale spend" were underscored as key advantages. The analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks. Despite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025. "Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years," the note added. With this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.

URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/klaviyo-stock-target-lifted-overweight-on-growth-prospects-93CH-3671056
Time Published: 2024-10-18T13:17:45Z

On Friday, Piper Sandler, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on shares of Klaviyo Inc (NYSE:NYSE:KVYO), raising the price target to $45.00 from the previous $34.00. The firm sustained its Overweight rating on the company's stock. The revision reflects a positive view of the company's growth trajectory, as Klaviyo's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is expected to surpass $1 billion, with an anticipated growth rate of over 28% year-over-year at the end of the year. Klaviyo's platform, which provides marketing tools that leverage data to enhance revenue streams through various channels like SMS, e-mail, and mobile push, is currently used by more than 151,000 retail brands. Notable clients include Vuori, Unilever (LON:ULVR), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). The analyst noted that new features and integrations with platforms such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Canva, TikTok, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) could significantly impact sales during the upcoming Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) season. The company's international prospects are also looking up, with planned expansions in language support. Presently supporting English and French, Klaviyo aims to include German, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Portuguese to cater to a broader global customer base. This move is expected to bolster the company's international expansion efforts in the following year. Piper Sandler expressed increased confidence in Klaviyo's ability to maintain a growth rate of over 25% and achieve a 10% or higher operating margin model. The updated price target of $45 is indicative of this optimism and the potential that the financial services firm sees in the company's strategic initiatives and market position. In other recent news, Klaviyo's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives have attracted attention. Klaviyo's revenue exceeded forecasts by $10 million, and operating profits rose by 65% year over year. Several analyst firms, including Baird and Benchmark, have reacted positively to these developments. Baird raised its price target for Klaviyo shares in anticipation of a strong third-quarter earnings report. Benchmark initiated coverage of Klaviyo's shares with a Buy rating, emphasizing the company's strategic integration of various marketing technologies. Moreover, KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded Klaviyo's stock to Overweight due to the company's strong growth trajectory. Barclays and TD Cowen also displayed confidence in Klaviyo's growth prospects, upgrading the stock rating to overweight and maintaining a Buy rating, respectively. In addition to its financial performance, Klaviyo has announced a partnership with TikTok to integrate its customer segmentation tools with the social media platform. This move is expected to enhance ad targeting and improve relationships with potential buyers. These are just some of the recent developments that have kept Klaviyo in the spotlight. Klaviyo's strong market position and growth potential, as highlighted by Piper Sandler's upgraded price target, are further supported by real-time data from InvestingPro. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 38.38% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and a 35.01% quarterly growth in Q2 2024. This aligns with the analyst's expectations of continued strong growth. InvestingPro Tips reveal that Klaviyo holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation to support its expansion plans. Additionally, nine analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company's near-term performance. The stock's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, with a strong 49.38% return over the last three months and a substantial 63.93% return over the past six months. This momentum has pushed the stock to trade near its 52-week high, with the current price at 98.06% of that peak. While these metrics paint a positive picture, investors should note that Klaviyo is currently trading at a high revenue valuation multiple and is not yet profitable over the last twelve months. However, analysts predict the company will become profitable this year, which could be a significant catalyst for the stock. For readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Klaviyo, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): ‘How Can You Have A Bull Birthday Party Without Inviting Meta?’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-meta-platforms-inc-114815248.html
Time Published: 2024-10-18T11:48:15Z

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list. On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. “The whole first year of this bull’s life was an anomaly. That’s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,” Cramer explained. He emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, “Every night I say there’s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it’s been right in front of you.” Cramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying: “The bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I’d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.” Cramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. “We had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.” He did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become “Fed watchers,” suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained: “When the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.” Cramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added: “Sure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.” Cramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. “Forget the macro, people. It’s not that meaningful when the Fed’s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,” he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that’s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Cramer mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in his list of stocks with the biggest gains. He emphasized Mark Zuckerberg's assertion that future ad campaigns will focus on Instagram and Reels and said: “Honestly, how can you have a bull birthday party without inviting Meta, without inviting Mark Zuckerberg? I would never think of it. His last conference call told you a tale that made it sound like all ad campaigns will soon start on Instagram and reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No. He has the AI to design the most effective targeted ads and you don't need to hire an advertising agency. Much better return on investment.” It is a leading technology company that focuses on creating products designed to facilitate connections and sharing among users through a variety of devices, including mobile phones, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The financial performance of Meta (NASDAQ:META) has been remarkable over the years, largely driven by the ongoing shift toward digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is expected to expand from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. With nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its platforms, the company generates significant advertising revenue. In its most recent quarterly report, Meta (NASDAQ:META) recorded an impressive $38.3 billion in ad revenue and a 22% increase in overall revenue compared to the previous year. The growth is particularly noteworthy given the scale of the company, which points to a strong demand for its advertising capabilities. Overall META ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Google’s search and ads chief is out
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/googles-search-and-ads-chief-is-out/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:40:12Z
Full Content:
Good morning. I was delighted to learn recently that Winamp, the free audio player of choice for a certain demographic (cough) of Windows users at the turn of the millennium, soldiers on to this day. Apparently “tens of millions” of users still fire it up on a regular basis, according to its Belgian owner—hopefully still with skins that look like an aftermarket head unit from a ‘96 Mitsubishi Eclipse. The name of Winamp’s owner, by the way? Llama Group. Which really whips…ah, nevermind. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. It’s big news, even for big tech: Prabhakar Raghavan, the most senior Google executive overseeing search and advertising, is leaving his gig. He spent four years leading the company’s core business. Raghavan isn’t leaving Google; he’ll become its chief technologist. “He’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence,” CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo. Why the change? Likely because Google’s cash cow is under assault. (And parent company Alphabet, for all its divisions, is still largely driven by that cash cow.) Artificial intelligence assistants threaten to replace search as the leading destination for information and antitrust regulators have taken the company’s primary moneymaker to task. Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan (and immediately occupy the “who will succeed Sundar” seat), with two caveats: The team overseeing Google’s Gemini generative assistant will move out of Raghavan’s former org and into Google DeepMind, and the team overseeing Google Assistant will join the group that handles the Android mobile operating system. Watch this space. —AN No one said the AI wars wouldn’t get heated. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff took to social media yesterday to put rival Microsoft on blast for its “disappointing” AI-powered assistant, Copilot. “It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy,” he wrote. “Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess.” (Salesforce, naturally, has been promoting its own AI-powered agent called Einstein. Ahem.) It’s not the first time Benioff has taken a swing at Copilot. He called the tool “the new Clippy,” in a dig at Microsoft’s memorable 1990s feature, in a television interview a month ago. Why the war footing? Because Salesforce needs to win mindshare against its more entrenched peers. Microsoft is able to win customers simply by deploying Copilot across its Office business suite as well as developer favorite GitHub; same deal for Google and Gemini. Salesforce may be tops in customer relationship management software—its ticker is CRM for a reason—but its peers are far bigger. Just remember, Marc: Coffee is for closers. —AN If 2023 was Meta’s “Year of Efficiency” then how come it’s still going on in late 2024? According to The Verge, the company is laying off staffers as it reorganizes teams in its WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs units. Meta says the aim is “to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.” So, nothing to do with Meta’s eye-watering capital expenditure in the AI race, then. But it’s not just Meta. Intel, which is struggling because of multiple reasons including the AI chip race, let go more than 2,000 employees in the U.S. this week. And Nokia, the telecommunications equipment maker, just announced over 2,000 job cuts in China, where life becomes ever harder for Western businesses. It’s not clear how many Meta employees are affected by the latest cuts there, but the figure’s unlikely to be in the same ballpark. In 2018, Zuora was on top of the world. The business software company had just gone public on the New York Stock Exchange. Founder and CEO Tien Tzuo had published a philosophical book called Subscribed. Seemingly everything was moving to a subscription-based business model—music to the ears of a company built to launch and manage such things. It’s been tough sledding in the years since. Revenue growth has proven steady but unspectacular. Rounds of layoffs have been demoralizing, even if they’ve kept the company’s profits in line. And the company’s stock has been hovering below $10 a share, making it a prime acquisition target. The winning suitors? None other than private equity firm Silver Lake and Singaporean wealth fund GIC. The pair announced Thursday that they will pick up Zuora for what amounts to $1.7 billion, a 6.2% premium, when the deal closes in early 2025. In theory, going private will allow Zuora to reverse its recent slowdown and better compete with billing rivals SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce. At least that’s what its new owners, uh, subscribe to. —AN It’s a win for the hearing impaired everywhere. The Federal Communications Commission approved new regulations on Thursday that require phonemakers to make their devices compatible with hearing aids, and vice versa. The rule includes recently approved over-the-counter hearing aids, which includes Apple’s “clinical grade” AirPods Pro 2. The FCC didn’t stop there. The federal agency approved a regulation that requires all new mobile handsets sold in the U.S. to allow users to raise the volume without introducing distortion. It also rolled out mandates that phone labels at point of sale include hearing aid compatibility. After a transition period, “Americans with hearing loss will no longer be limited…in the mobile handset marketplace,” the FCC said. To which we say: Heard. —AN —Stripe sniffs around a crypto stablecoin acquisition. The purported price? One billion dollars. —Netflix ad-tier subscribers jump 35%. It beat estimates—barely—in its latest quarter. —Automattic CEO tells staff: Loose lips sink ships. Nearly 160 take a buyout as the company wades through deepening legal drama. —FBI arrests suspect in SEC social media hack. The stunt drove up Bitcoin’s price by $1,000. —Permira takes Squarespace private for $7.2b. It also sold Tock, a foodie favorite, to American Express. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Jennifer Newstead, Chief Legal Officer of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently sold 905 shares of the company's Class A Common Stock, amounting to a total transaction value of $533,922. The shares were sold at a price of $589.97 each. Following this transaction, Newstead holds 33,292 shares directly. The sale was conducted under a pre-arranged trading plan established on November 30, 2023. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen several financial firms, including TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities, raise their price targets on the company's shares, underlining an optimistic outlook for the firm's revenue growth. TD Cowen, in particular, expects Meta's revenue to grow by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter, attributing this anticipated rise to enhanced user engagement and better monetization of video content. The company has also been making strategic adjustments affecting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. In addition, Mizuho Securities has highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising and the significant potential in Meta's messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. However, Meta has also been ordered to face lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. These recent developments underscore the dynamic and evolving landscape in which Meta is operating. While Jennifer Newstead's recent stock sale might raise eyebrows, it's crucial to view this transaction within the broader context of Meta Platforms' financial performance and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a substantial market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, underscoring its status as a tech giant. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 24.28% increase over the last twelve months, reaching $149.78 billion. Meta's financial health appears strong, as evidenced by two key InvestingPro Tips. First, the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a solid financial foundation. Second, Meta demonstrates "impressive gross profit margins," which stood at 81.49% for the last twelve months. These factors suggest that despite executive stock sales, the company's underlying business fundamentals remain sound. It's worth noting that Meta's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a one-year price total return of 78.6%. This aligns with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "high return over the last year." For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into Meta's financial outlook and market position.

It’s go time! With just 26 days between Black Friday and Christmas, the shopping season is short, fast, and bursting with opportunities. But here’s the catch—your product feed is the key to seizing every sale. If it’s not running at peak performance, you’re leaving money on the table. Good news? There’s still time to turbocharge your feed, lock in those offers, and make this season a record-breaker. Let’s get started! Shoppers are hunting for deals, but can they find you? If your product feed isn’t speaking their language, you’re practically invisible. It’s time to optimize with real customer search terms, embedding trending phrases like “best holiday deals” or specifics like “top tech gifts under £50” right into your product titles. Your feed should be like a treasure map guiding shoppers straight to what they want! Shoppers need to find exactly what they want quickly—whether it’s the perfect tech gift or a last-minute stocking filler. 🔥Action: Use search data to plug trending terms into your feed. Your titles shouldn’t just appear—they should shout, “I’m exactly what you’re looking for!” Your feed needs to grab attention fast. While search terms get you in the game, keyword optimization is what ensures you dominate the search results. The right keywords, strategically placed, ensure your products not only show up but win the click. Shoppers are comparison shopping, and if your feed isn’t optimized, you’re missing out on those valuable clicks. 🔥Action: Get those hot keywords working for you. Think of them as the fuel that powers your engine, driving traffic to your listings. This holiday season waits for no one. If your products aren’t live in the feed early, you’ll be playing catch-up. Early approval will mean you’re ready to fuel the holiday sales sleigh. Getting your products and promotions into the feed right now minimizes delays and gives you a head start on revenue. Shoppers need accurate stock info—nothing is worse than clicking on a deal only to find it’s out of stock. 🔥 Action: Feed your products into the system ASAP! Don’t leave those holiday sales hanging. Be the first to get your promotions approved and watch the revenue roll in. Shoppers move fast, and your product feed needs to keep up. Real-time updates on stock, pricing, and promotions are the name of the game. Don’t let outdated info be the Grinch that steals your sales—an out-of-date feed is a silent sales killer. Inconsistent product information across platforms or out-of-date stock can destroy trust and kill sales. 🔥Action: Keep the data flowing! Make sure every price drop, promotion, and stock change are updated in real-time to stay competitive. Your product feed doesn’t just live on Google Shopping—it powers your ads across Meta, Pinterest, and beyond. Customers get frustrated when information doesn’t match between platforms, leading to abandoned carts. To win across platforms, you need cross-channel consistency. Whether they see your ad on Meta’s Dynamic Product Ads (DPA) or a Google Shopping listing, they expect accurate, up-to-date info every time. 🔥Action: Synchronize your feed across every platform. When your product info is consistent, shoppers trust you, and trust = revenue! Price-sensitive customers are hunting for deals and will compare prices before purchasing. With tighter budgets, every pound needs to work harder. That’s where Custom Labels and Key Size Rules come into play. This combined strategy helps you push bestsellers or high-margin products, whilst ensuing ad spend is focused on in stock products. 🔥Action: Don’t waste budget on low-stock items that won’t make the cut. Laser-focus your ad spend on products that matter. Use Custom Labels and Key Size Rules to make sure you’re pushing high-demand, high-margin items. Shoppers are more budget-conscious than ever, so your pricing has to be spot-on. They’re not just looking for deals—they expect transparency, and they’re ready to pounce on promotions and discounts as soon as they see them. Promotions and real-time discounts can be the difference between a “pass” and a purchase. If your feed isn’t reflecting the latest deals, you could be missing out. 🔥Action: Stay on top of pricing and promotions. Feed those updates into your listings immediately to catch deal-seeking buyers before they move on to the next best offer. As the holiday rush wraps up, it’s time to think about the next peak season. If you don’t have a feed management partner, you’re leaving growth on the table. A great partner ensures everything is optimized for long-term success, helping you hit every sales milestone with confidence. 🔥Action: If feed management feels like a challenge, consider working with experts who can align your strategy and ensure your feed is always working to its full potential. With the holiday shopping window already in full swing, it’s time to act! Everyday matters, and with the right feed optimization—whether it’s embedding search terms, fine-tuning keywords, or ensuring consistency across platforms—you’ll capture every sale from Black Friday to January.

Title: How CIOs Can Maximize ROI On Enterprise AI Platforms
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2024/10/17/how-cios-can-maximize-roi-on-enterprise-ai-platforms/

Plus: AI Policy Records Of Trump And Harris, Apple And Nvidia See Their Values Increase, Companies To Improve AI Get Investments, AMD And Intel Join Forces On x86 Collaboration Even though neither of the candidates on major presidential tickets are talking much about AI, it’s a huge area of concern for tech leaders. Nearly three in four tech leaders said the election will have a major impact on whether the U.S. tech sector will be able to stay ahead of global competitors, according to a poll published this week by EY US. Specifically, they said, it will impact cybersecurity and data protection, AI and machine learning, and user data and content oversight. There are very few issues that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are even remotely close to agreeing on, so this result from the poll isn’t a surprise. But it’s worth taking a look at what may happen in terms of tech policy if either candidate is elected. As a part of President Joe Biden’s administration, Harris supported the executive order he signed last year to place guardrails on the use and development of AI. The executive order mandates guidelines and standards for government use of AI, requires government oversight of AI models that could pose a risk to national security, and essentially sets the stage to ensure privacy, equity and civil rights are protected through the use of AI technology. Harris spoke about the order days after it was signed at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London, saying it is possible to ensure ordinary people are protected from AI misuse—like explicit deepfake images of them being shared, or insurance claims being denied because of faulty AI algorithms—and not stifle broader innovation. When Biden signed the executive order last year, several tech CEOs were immediately on board and had been working with the federal government to develop AI regulations. Trump said last December he plans to cancel Biden’s executive order if elected, and that he’d also “ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on day one.” There hasn’t been much else published about what Trump would do instead, though a rundown by law firm Winston + Strawn indicates he has said that AI’s power to distort can be “scary,” and the threat AI could pose to security requires immediate attention. When Trump was president in 2019, he signed an executive order for the federal government to direct more funding to AI R&D and work toward building governance standards. Tech executive and self proclaimed “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk has been close to the Trump campaign, and Musk has used his social platform X to share his view that the First Amendment can protect campaign-related AI deepfakes and reproductions of copyrighted images. Trump has not endorsed Musk’s views, but he could be influenced by them. But no matter who wins the election, 87% of tech leaders told EY they plan to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year, with most saying they want to reallocate existing resources toward AI. So even if the election has a huge impact on larger policy, businesses will stay on the journey to implement the technology to make their work more efficient and useful. Even for a technology like AI, which many are committed to investing in, companies need to examine the ROI for systems they want to adopt. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how to determine this and get the greatest value out of AI investments. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nominations for Forbes’ CIO Next List are now open. If you know any CIOs who are making an outsized impact on their company or business, please let us know about them here by November 8. Apple introduced its new iPad Mini this week. Apple’s stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, with the tech company briefly being worth $3.61 trillion. The likely catalyst was the announcement of a new iPad Mini model, which is the first update to that model since 2021. The new iPad Mini, which is available for pre-orders now and goes on sale next week, has a powerful A17 processor that will work with the company’s Apple Intelligence features when it launches later this month, writes Forbes senior contributor David Phelan. It also has 128GB of storage in its basic configuration, which is twice that of earlier models. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said lead times for the iPhone 16, released last month, are “encouraging,” and the 56 million iPhones shipped last month was 10% more than expected, writes Forbes’ Derek Saul. Apple’s share price moderated a bit on Wednesday, but it will be both rolling out Apple Intelligence and reporting earnings at the end of the month, so more big changes can be expected. Nvidia’s stock has also been rallying for much of October, and is nipping at Apple’s heels as the current second most valuable company by market cap. Nvidia’s stock surge, fueled by optimism and encouraging words about demand from CEO Jensen Huang, briefly moderated on Tuesday. Dutch firm ASML, which makes equipment used to manufacture high-end AI chips, mistakenly reported earnings a day early and warned of “more gradual growth” to come, with 2025 revenue projections well below analysts’ expectations. ASML’s share price fell 17.5% on Tuesday, bringing down stock for Nvidia and other AI chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Broadcom. But the rally picked back up again Thursday morning, when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported blockbuster earnings and increased its revenue guidance. TSMC’s stock went up more than 12%, boosting its market cap above $1 trillion, and taking chip stocks including Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Intel with it. Decagon cofounders Jesse Zhang (left) and Ashwin Sreenivas. Two startups focused on improving AI platforms raised large Series B rounds this week. Decagon, a platform that builds AI customer service agents, raised $65 million in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from tech investor Elad Gil and VC firms Accel and Bond Capital, writes Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava. Decagon, whose agents are used by companies including Notion, Duolingo, Rippling, Bilt and Substack, is now valued at $650 million, with $100 million in total funding to date. The company plans to use the funds to grow its team, go after new types of customers and add a voice feature. Galileo, a startup that evaluates AI models to ensure they aren’t hallucinating or giving out proprietary data when prompted, announced a $45 million funding round, writes Forbes’ Richard Nieva. The round was led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation by Premji Invest, venture arms of Citibank and the data storage company Databricks and Hugging Face founder Clem Delangue. The three-year-old company, which offers four products to help companies train and evaluate their AI systems, says it has raised a total of $68 million to date. getty As technology changes, competitors are becoming allies. Intel and AMD announced the creation of an x86 ecosystem advisory group this week, dedicated to bringing tech industry leaders together to come up with consistent and compatible implementations for a variety of applications and platforms using x86 architecture. Forbes senior contributor Patrick Moorhead talked to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and AMD CEO Lisa Su about the rival companies—they still will be competitors, Su and Gelsinger told Moorhead—coming together now to give x86 processors the same kind of alignment found in the Arm processor ecosystem. Su told Moorhead that customers have likely been wanting this kind of arrangement for decades to make it easier on their software stack, and working with Intel on the standards is “a major benefit for our customers and for the ecosystem.” The two CEOs said the industry cooperation will help speed innovation and build market opportunities for x86 processors going forward. Most of Big Tech is represented in the group, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Broadcom, Dell, HP, HPE, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat, Tim Sweeney of Epic Games and Linus Torvalds of the Linux Foundation. ContractPodAi President and CTO Anurag Malik. Whenever a company wants to add new tech, even the most bullish will question its ROI. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how companies can get the most out of their investments in AI technology. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do most companies go about trying to figure out the ROI of generative AI? Malik: We are all running a business. Most companies buying a product are doing it for return on investment, with or without AI. I think the onus lies on the product provider to show that value. Value can come in many ways. It could be time saved, people being redirected to something more efficient, cutting down on outside spend. We think of AI as something that’s not going to take jobs away, but it’s going to make you much more efficient. You’ll be able to do much more of what you used to do before with limited resources, especially repeatable tasks, mundane tasks, which is very easy for AI to pick up. One thing we do is show productivity dashboards within the product, which shows time saved, number of tasks finished in whatever amount of time. We let our buyers input how much time it takes them today. Then we do a comparison: This is how long it’s taking you now, and you can put in a dollar value to the labor and then get ROI. One of the shortfalls is people tend to map existing processes to a technology, which is very different from how they were do[ing] things manually before. Helping them bridge that and re-imagining how they would use the technology to do things different[ly] and be much more productive is something the provider should do because the buyer is new to our technology and it’s on us to guide them. It’s more of a consultative way of selling AI and educating the customers as we go along. When a company is looking to adopt AI, or any sort of tech system that will definitely change the way they do things, should they be thinking ROI first, or should they be thinking about long-term capabilities? Being long-sided on this is way more valuable. In fact, when we onboard customers, we tell them, “Hey, we all walk and run.” As cliche as it sounds, you can’t go from zero to 100 miles an hour in two seconds. This is not a Tesla. This is a new system. There’s people involved who have to learn to use it. So let’s get the low-hanging fruits. You may not see it’s better than what you do today. You may not see humongous ROI, but if you get people on board and make them get used to the product, the road down is going to look much more productive for you. Absolutely, that long-term vision is very necessary. Software providers have to educate their customers to see that, to give them that vision. Because remember, everybody who comes to buy technology is trying to solve a pain point today. They’re not trying to see what’s going to happen in three years down the line. Yes, they’re invested in it, but if you educate them well enough that, hey, you're not only going to solve this pain point today, but if you take a step back, you can see the vision of how you can really transform how you’re doing things. What are some of the things that get in the way of companies realizing the ROI potential that they have with AI? Adoption. The distance to change is the biggest thing I’ve seen. Especially global companies: different regions, different teams. For it to go from one region to another is the biggest challenge. One thing I’ve seen is if you get the first one right and make a good story of it, educate teams wherever in the world they are, it works very well. The first success story is very important. It doesn’t matter how well your software works. If people are not going to use it, it’s as good as crap. Adoption and change management—making people understand [they need] to change the way they do things—is very important. Even more important than the actual technology itself. Amazon entered into agreements with Dominion Energy, Energy Northwest and startup X-energy to fund development and deployment of small modular reactors—small and advanced nuclear reactors—to create the power needed for AI datacenters. $500 million: Amount invested in X-energy for these reactors, anchoed by Amazon 960: Megawatts of power to be created by the four SMRs Amazon is helping Energy Northwest develop. This is enough to power the equivalent of 770,000 homes ‘Nuclear is a great option for how we scale the world’s energy needs’: Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told Forbes Executives are faced with an avalanche of tasks that can be difficult to prioritize.

At Meta Connect in September, one of the newest products that caught my eye was a limited-edition pair of Ray-Ban glasses -- with a transparent frame, sapphire transition lenses, and a fairly accessible $429 price tag. Since I've already had great experiences with the Meta Quest 3 and Viture Pro XR glasses, I decided it was time to try the highly praised smart glasses by Meta. Fortunately, I was able to buy a pair right as stock ran out. Only 7,500 units were made available worldwide, and mine is number 4,255, marked on the inside of the right frame and on the charging case. ZDNET's Kerry Wan reviewed the standard Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, and after months of use, he still enjoys their functionality. As announced at Meta Connect, existing Meta glasses will also receive software updates, including natural language processing, the ability to remember and recall key information, live translations, and more. Also: I've tested a lot of tech in the past 6 months - the Meta Ray-Bans were the biggest surprise While deciding whether to make the purchase, I intended to use the glasses to capture video that's difficult to record accurately with a camera or smartphone. This includes testing watches, fitness gear, and e-bikes, as well as creating vertical short-form videos for YouTube and Instagram, with both hands free to interact with devices. I've used action cameras for some of this content before, but I wanted to see if a first-person perspective would result in better footage. Reviewed by ZDNET, the smart glasses can record videos, play Bluetooth audio, and perform useful AI tasks. I also spend time fly fishing, where both hands are occupied, and I want to capture video and still images of these experiences to share with family and friends who don't want to wade through cold rivers and catch small trout. My large, energetic cat demands daily playtime with wand toys, and now I can easily record his incredible acrobatics and funny antics on the go. It's been over two weeks since my Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Limited Edition glasses arrived, and they've exceeded my expectations. In addition to capturing great video while running with new watches, testing e-bikes, fishing, and playing with my cat, I've recorded a few fights on the ice at a local minor league hockey game, playful snow leopard kittens at the zoo, and my daily commute as the fall leaves turn under a glowing sunset. You can now capture up to three minutes of video by setting that as the default length, and the audio quality during recording has been much better than I expected. Also: New Meta Ray-Ban AI features roll out, making the smart glasses even more tempting Beyond video and still capture, I now prefer using the glasses for calls and podcasts over my AirPods Pro while walking around downtown Seattle. Like the bone conduction headphones I use for running, the Ray-Ban glasses leave my ears open for better awareness of my surroundings, and the sound quality is good for podcasts and music. However, in heavy traffic, the sound can be too quiet, so a future version with bone conduction technology would be ideal. I also appreciate the various messaging options, especially being able to have messages read aloud and easily reply to friends and family. Keeping my phone in my pocket while commuting and wearing the Meta glasses feels like an optimal way to get around. I'm enjoying spending less time looking at screens and more time engaging with the world around me. The transition lenses are a game changer as well. They allow me to wear the glasses both indoors, where I listen to music, make hands-free inquiries with Meta AI, and handle calls and messaging, and outdoors, where I would normally switch to sunglasses. However, I wish the lenses would get a bit darker in full sunlight. Also: In a surprise twist, Meta is suddenly crushing Apple in the innovation battle - Prism The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses have improved my running performance by displaying key health stats, and it would be fantastic to see similar functionality in a future version of the Meta glasses. Even being able to ask Meta for running stats would help me keep my eyes on the road and stay focused on my goals. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Limited Edition model of the Meta Ray-Bans, which is designed to give me a glimpse into the underlying technology. And I'm even more excited about the added utility that future updates will bring.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Nuclear energy is currently attracting exorbitant interest to meet the soaring demand from data centers throughout the continental US as the nation prepares to tap the century-defining potential that AI offers. Now, Craig-Hallum has upgraded the stock price outlook of NuScale, citing its regulatory head start and "a meaningful pipeline and customer list, including in AI/data center applications." Connect the Dots A. Google announcement a few days back.B. Microsoft with 3 mile island.C. Ellison? Oracle with 3 SMRs.D. Apple and META are next! — Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) October 16, 2024 The so-called Mag 7 companies have been aggressively pivoting towards nuclear energy in recent months to meet their soaring energy demands from AI-related workloads. By now, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon have all announced their plans to tap nuclear energy via either the conventional route or the so-called SMRs, which are small-scale, modular reactors, with an as yet unproven track record. Moreover, it appears increasingly likely that Apple and Meta might also announce their nuclear-focused deals soon. also known as the "Next AI Trade", or "Power Up America", laid out to subs in April. This is the best performing basket of 2024, outperforming even the Broad AI tradehttps://t.co/3WxL99fSed https://t.co/ovOOjMtaAl pic.twitter.com/ngeAtKsR6C — zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 16, 2024 In fact, so fierce is this nuclear-focused tailwind at the moment that it has been dubbed the "next AI trade." According to HSBC, data centers can account for 9 percent of the total electricity consumption in the US by 2030. Logically, nuclear energy provides the only sustainable, zero-carbon option to meet this oncoming demand. NUSCALE POWER $SMR price-target raised to $21 (from $16) at Craig-Hallum, saying a nuclear power "renaissance" is underway, and we are at the beginning of a "multi-decade megatrend": "A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 17, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. Craig-Hallum has now raised NuScale's stock price target to $21 per share, citing a secular tailwind from a nuclear power "renaissance" that is likely to evolve into a "multi-decade megatrend. The investment bank notes: "As part of this shift, small modular nuclear reactors have a real place in multiple applications, especially in support of the urgent need for zero-emissions baseload power for AI/data centers." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, SMRs pair high energy densities with a reliable, zero-carbon power output, making them ideal for data centers. Like all fission reactors, SMRs use a controlled nuclear chain reaction to produce steam that then drives turbines. Increasingly, companies such as Oklo are adopting liquid metals as coolants in their reactors. Most SMRs, however, require low-enriched uranium (HALEU) as the primary fuel, which is in short supply at the moment, given the sanctions on Russia. Do note that NuScale experienced a considerable setback recently when the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) terminated the company's only SMR project, which was also the first of its kind in the US, citing cost overruns. However, the company continues to develop projects in South Korea and Romania. Coming back, Craig-Hallum states in its investment note that is out today: "Activity over the last few months has been building and reached a fever pitch over the last few days with high-profile nuclear announcements (including SMRs) by Google and Amazon." It goes on to note: "While not involved specifically in either deal, we see NuScale as ideally positioned for an acceleration of nuclear/SMR adoption with a 5+ year regulatory head start and a meaningful pipeline and customer list including in AI/data center applications."

On Thursday, Mizuho Securities sustained its positive stance on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), lifting its price target to $650 from the previous $600 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the firm's checks on advertising spending reveal performance surpassing the consensus and reaching the higher end of the company's guidance, which anticipates a 20% year-over-year growth. The analyst at Mizuho highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising. Despite the expectation that capital expenditures (capex) might rise following the second-quarter guidance of a 37% year-over-year increase, it was noted that Meta has operational expenditure (opex) flexibility that could balance the heightened depreciation costs. In justification of the new price target, Mizuho increased its target multiple for Meta's fiscal year 2026 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA) to 13 times, up from 12 times. This adjustment reflects the high end of the stock's historical range. The analyst expressed confidence in Meta's ability to outperform expectations, suggesting that it could surpass forecasts and raise future guidance, citing significant potential in its messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. The analyst's remarks also touched on the current market sentiment, describing Meta's stock as a "crowded trade into the print." This suggests that many investors may be anticipating positive results. Nonetheless, the analyst's outlook implies that Meta stands out among major tech companies for its potential to exceed expectations and offer promising developments in technology. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has initiated strategic adjustments impacting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams. The company has been streamlining teams to align with long-term goals and location strategy, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. Meta has also been facing legal challenges, with a federal judge ordering the company to confront lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. Meanwhile, several financial firms have offered positive outlooks on Meta's future. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. Stifel raised its price target for Meta to $663, citing strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Roth/MKM also raised the stock's price target to $620, reflecting optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects. Finally, Meta has made strides in combating disinformation, dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting users in Moldova ahead of the country's presidential election and EU membership referendum. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms. Meta Platforms Inc.'s strong financial position and market performance align well with Mizuho Securities' bullish outlook. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the tech sector. The company's impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months supports Mizuho's expectation of continued strong performance. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and has "liquid assets exceed short term obligations." These factors contribute to Meta's financial flexibility, which could be crucial as the company navigates potential increases in capital expenditures, as mentioned in the Mizuho analysis. Furthermore, Meta's "impressive gross profit margins" of 81.49% underscore its operational efficiency, potentially allowing for the opex flexibility that Mizuho suggests could offset higher depreciation costs. The company's strong profitability is further evidenced by its high return on assets of 23.54%. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for Meta Platforms Inc., providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Techs led US stocks higher on Thursday as TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook eased worries about AI chip demand, with the next batch of earnings on deck. Strong retail sales data also helped lift the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flatline to hold near record highs after the major averages rebounded to close with gains. Contract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom. TSMC's US-listed shares climbed 8%, poised to cross a $1 trillion market valuation if the gains hold in the regular session. Its forecast helped spur a rally chip stocks including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia. On the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November. After a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter. After the bell, Netflix becomes the first "Magnificent Seven" megacap to report, with Wall Street on watch for price-hike news to potentially lift the stock.

The data released Thursday morning gives fuel to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a strong September jobs report. Investors were watching the data for clues on what the Federal Reserve's interest rate move will be at the next FOMC meeting in November. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) surged 9.6% in premarket trading, putting the stock in position for an all-time high after its third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Pixabay/ Public Domain Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%. Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year. By the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector. This is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers. Record profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025. After other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.” Overall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

"I've made so many mistakes in my investment career — one of them was I sold all my Nvidia probably somewhere between $800 and $950," Druckenmiller said in an interview on Bloomberg. "I own none and I owned none the last 400 points." Druckenmiller's comments do not reflect Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect in June. The stock closed Wednesday at $135.72. On a split-adjusted basis, his sales would have taken place at between $80 and $95. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, selling its graphics processing units, or GPUs, to top cloud companies and the biggest developers of large language models. The stock soared 239% last year and is up another 174% in 2024, closing at a fresh record on Monday. Earlier this year, Druckenmiller revealed on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he cut his Duquesne Family Office's position in Nvidia in late March, saying "we've had a hell of a run." Taking the split into account, Duquesne owned about 6.18 million shares at the start of the year, 1.76 million at the end of the first quarter and 214,000 when the second quarter closed. In the third quarter of last year, Nvidia was his top holding. At the time, he owned 8.75 million shares worth around $400 million. If he held onto that entire stake, it would currently be worth about $1.19 billion. Duquesne has not released its third-quarter holdings yet. "It tripled in a year, and I thought the valuation was rich," Druckenmiller told Bloomberg. "Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down, we'd get involved again. But right now, I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale." Nvidia is expected to release quarterly results in November, but most of its top customers, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, will report financials later this month. Druckenmiller told CNBC in May that Nvidia was "a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term." He added that he was introduced to Nvidia in 2022, when "I didn't even know how to spell it."

Title: What Are The Magnificent Seven Stocks?

Time Published: 2024-10-16T19:37:25Z

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services. Apple's product line includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch and various services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become a significant player in the cloud computing market, competing directly with Amazon Web Services. Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms. The company's flagship products include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. In recent years, Meta has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality technologies, signaling its ambition to lead the development of the "metaverse."

Nvidia, founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a technology company best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and professional markets. In recent years, Nvidia has become a significant player in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

Title: Chip Stocks Fall While Energy For AI Moves Into Spotlight

Shares of Nvidia fell 5% as global chipmakers lost $420 billion in market cap on Tuesday. (Photo via ... [+] Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Key Takeaways Stocks fell on Tuesday led by a $420 billion drop in the global chip stocks. The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%. Meantime the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%; however, small cap stocks eked out a small gain, rising just under 0.2%. The big story on Tuesday was a warning from chipmaker ASML of a slower than expected recovery in some areas of the chip sector. That stock dropped 16% while the sector fell 5% overall. Other notable chip stocks that saw sharp declines included Advanced Micro Devices, down 5%. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices each fell 3.4%, and Nvidia dropped 5%. While chip makers fell, other stocks in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem started garnering attention. Specifically, suppliers of nuclear energy rallied on the day. With substantial energy demands to power AI, companies are turning toward nuclear energy as a low-cost source. Google announced on Tuesday morning that they signed a deal with Kairos Power, a maker of small-scale nuclear reactors. While Kairos isn't publicly traded, other stocks in the sector also rallied, including Oklo Inc. and Centrus Energy. Some other stocks in the news today include Boeing. The company announced it will raise $10 billion by selling new shares of stock to plug an existing cash crunch. That stock is trading slightly lower in premarket. Meantime, Starbucks could percolate today following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley with a price target of $115. On Tuesday, Starbucks closed at $95.04. Speaking of Morgan Stanley, that company posted earnings this morning that beat across the board. Net new assets came in at $63.9 billion, suggesting the company is taking market share. In premarket trading, shares of Morgan Stanley are indicated higher by 3%. We've already heard from other banking stocks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. All three stocks were lower on Tuesday with net interest income being cited as a challenge for those three companies. There aren't a lot of household name companies reporting earnings today; however, after the close tomorrow, we'll hear from Netflix. I'll be listening for two things on their conference call. First, does the company plan to raise prices. There are several analysts calling for that. Second, does the company have any further plans to move into live sports programming. Next month the company will host the Mike Tyson fight and I'm very curious what kind of numbers that event does and whether or not it serves as a springboard into sports. For the year, shares of Netflix are up 45%. Finally, every now and again I like to share what our customers at tastytrade are doing. Some of the companies where we're seeing bullish activity include Visa, Meta and Amazon. Meantime, we're seeing more bearish activity in Starbucks, Walmart and Intel. I think the bullish activity is likely a sign that our customers are optimistic about the upcoming holiday season, as well as optimism over continued strength in Meta. As for the bearish activity, I believe with Walmart it is attributable to shoppers trading up. I've spoken about people trading down when money gets tight, moving from retailers like Target to Walmart. I think right now, we're seeing just the opposite as the economy is humming along. With respect to Intel, I think customers may see this company as having fallen too far to recover. Finally, the sentiment in Starbucks could be related to the company's recent struggles prior to naming a new CEO. For today, it is VIX expiration and anytime you get a VIX expiration, you can see some choppy trading. I'm also watching bonds. After having suffered nine consecutive down days, bonds may have bottomed out and interest rates may have topped out. I'm also watching some of these nuclear energy companies to see if they can continue building momentum.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

Title: Meta Platforms target holds amid AI spending forecast

Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) with a steady price target of $670.00. The firm's analysis suggests that Meta and its major AI industry competitors are likely to continue their aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. The projection follows recent reports on OpenAI's internal projections, which anticipate a quadrupling of total compute costs to approximately $24 billion by the fiscal year 2026, including $15 billion in training and $9 billion on inference costs. According to the analyst, the consensus capital expenditure (Capex) estimates for Meta, sourced from Visible Alpha, are $47 billion for the fiscal year 2025 and $49 billion for 2026, up from $38 billion in 2024. These figures might not fully account for the costs associated with staying competitive in state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and Meta's AI inference needs, including the construction of new data centers (DCs). The firm also anticipates that consensus estimates for depreciation and amortization (D&A) might see upward revisions from the current projections of $19 billion for 2025 and $23 billion for 2026. The analysis suggests that Meta could aim to significantly expand its compute capacity to over 2.5 million GPUs within the next 2-3 years, a substantial increase from its current capacity of over 600,000 GPUs. The forecasted Capex spend for 2025 and 2026 is likely to include more than 2 million GPUs, amounting to over $40 billion. When combined with other server assets and data center additions, Meta's cumulative Capex for these years could surpass $100 billion, which is a considerable increase compared to current expectations. This investment is seen as a response to the competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving AI technology landscape. Meta Platforms Inc. is set to confront state lawsuits alleging that the company's social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. The federal judge rejected Meta's attempt to dismiss the claims, allowing the case to proceed. In financial developments, Stifel raised its price target for Meta to $663, maintaining a 'Buy' rating on the stock. Roth/MKM and Truist Securities have also raised their price targets for Meta, showing optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects. Meanwhile, Meta has taken significant strides in combating disinformation by dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting users in Moldova ahead of the country's presidential election and EU membership referendum. Meta Platforms Inc.'s aggressive investment strategy in AI infrastructure aligns with its strong financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a market capitalization of $1.48 trillion and has demonstrated impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This robust growth supports the company's ability to fund substantial capital expenditures in AI technology. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and has "liquid assets exceed short term obligations." These factors provide Meta with the financial flexibility to pursue large-scale investments in AI infrastructure without compromising its financial stability. Moreover, Meta's "impressive gross profit margins" of 81.49% and high operating income margin of 41.21% suggest that the company has the financial resources to sustain significant investments in AI while maintaining profitability. This financial resilience is crucial as Meta aims to expand its compute capacity and stay competitive in the AI arms race. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of Meta's financial position and growth prospects, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips, providing valuable insights into the company's market performance and potential.

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on FIAT (105.76%), CONY (101.35%), ULTY (100.99%), YMAX (51.97%), YMAG (62.33%) and Others

October 16, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs (except YMAX,YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 15, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of such date, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH,GDXY and FIAT. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Companies that have not adapted are lagging behind, while those with the foresight to join the trend are experiencing exponential growth. Nvidia is among the latter, having made an early entry into a rapidly expanding segment. Now, Nvidia is about to claim once again the title of the most valuable company in the world. This is not the first time that Nvidia has achieved such a milestone. The company had already managed to surpass big names in the industry, such as Apple and Microsoft. However, this victory was fleeting, as both Apple and Microsoft eventually overtook it once more. Now, a recent surge in Nvidia shares to an all-time high of $138.07 could soon turn the tables. Following the recent rise in Nvidia shares, the company also surpasses another milestone: reaching a market capitalization of around $3.4 trillion. This also makes it one of only three companies to have surpassed this valuation. Currently, only Apple surpasses it with a market cap of $3.55 trillion. The AI boom began with the availability of the ChatGPT preview version. The chatbot’s impressive “reasoning” capabilities led the entire industry to turn its attention to artificial intelligence. Well, Nvidia was there from the start, as the service ran on the company’s hardware. Since then, all major companies that have wanted to catch up in the segment have turned to the company’s AI chips. The list includes Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. Nvidia quickly positioned itself as the leading supplier of AI hardware. As a result, the company’s stock shows an incredible growth of 2,800.6% over the past five years. Furthermore, 2024 brought a year-over-year growth of the stock price by 186.6%. The growth trend is not expected to stop, as companies demand increasingly powerful and efficient AI hardware. Currently, Nvidia is working on the next generation of AI chips, known as “Blackwell.” The brand publicly stated that the current lawsuit by Blackwell is “insane,” so they expect to receive billions of dollars in revenue by the end of this year alone.

Title: Alphabet VP Amie Thuener sells $473,929 in company stock
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/alphabet-vp-amie-thuener-sells-473929-in-company-stock-93CH-3664792
Time Published: 2024-10-15T21:34:58Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently disclosed that Amie Thuener O'Toole, the company's Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, sold shares of the company's Class C Capital Stock. According to the SEC filing, Thuener sold a total of 2,834 shares at a price of $167.23 per share, amounting to a total transaction value of $473,929. Following this sale, Thuener holds 26,349 shares of Class C Capital Stock. The transactions were executed under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for selling stocks, thereby helping to avoid any potential accusations of insider trading. This plan was adopted by Thuener on May 31, 2024. In addition to Class C Capital Stock, Thuener also holds 8,940 shares of Class A Common Stock and 13,806 shares of Class C Google Stock Units, with vesting schedules detailed in the filing. In other recent news, Google, an Alphabet Inc. company, has been actively involved in significant legal and business developments. Google has sought to delay the enforcement of a court order mandating changes to its Play Store operations, following an antitrust lawsuit by Epic Games. The company believes the injunction could introduce substantial safety, security, and privacy risks into the Android ecosystem. Google has also struck a deal with Kairos Power to procure electricity from small modular reactors (SMRs), marking a significant step towards fulfilling the increasing energy demands of Google's artificial intelligence operations. This deal is set to bring Kairos' inaugural SMR online by 2030. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is preparing to reveal its much-anticipated robotaxi at a Hollywood event. The company plans to create a fleet of self-driving taxis, available to passengers via an app. Tesla owners could also earn income by enlisting their vehicles in the service. The company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software is expected to play a key role in the robotaxi service. In another development, tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have proposed an alternative power payment plan for data centers in Ohio. This proposal comes in response to utility company AEP Ohio's plan for pre-payments and financial assurances to cover significant energy usage by data centers and cryptocurrency miners. The tech companies' counter-proposal aims to establish a fair framework for power payment that accommodates the growing energy needs of data centers while addressing utility companies' concerns. To provide additional context to Amie Thuener O'Toole's recent stock sale, it's worth examining Alphabet's current financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a substantial market capitalization of $2.04 trillion, underscoring its position as one of the world's most valuable companies. The company's P/E ratio stands at 23.64, which, when considered alongside an InvestingPro Tip noting that Alphabet is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth," suggests the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This could provide insight into why insiders might choose to retain significant holdings despite periodic sales. Alphabet's financial health appears robust, with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet." This strong liquidity position is further supported by the fact that Alphabet's "liquid assets exceed short term obligations," indicating financial stability that may reassure investors in light of insider transactions. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $328.28 billion, with a notable revenue growth of 13.38% over the same period. This growth trajectory aligns with Alphabet's status as a "prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry," as noted in an additional InvestingPro Tip. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers over 10 additional tips for Alphabet, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Fresh off of a record closing high, Nvidia stock slid Tuesday as part of a semiconductor chip stock slump with an unusual impetus: A less-than-stellar earnings release from a Dutch company which accidentally came out earlier than expected. Nvidia stock struggled Tuesday. Nvidia shares fell 4.5% in Tuesday trading, wiping out some $155 billion in market capitalization for the California firm, more than AT&T’s $154 billion total market value. Nvidia stock had its steepest daily loss since Sept. 3’s 10% dip, which marked the largest erosion of one company’s market cap in a single day in history at $279 billion. Shares of several other firms involved in designing and manufacturing the semiconductor technology powering the generative AI explosion also tumbled, with Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Broadcom stocks sliding at least 3.5%. The stateside chip stock dip came after Dutch firm ASML, which makes much of the equipment used to make the high-tech AI chips and works closely with Nvidia, reported earnings a day earlier than expected due to what the company attributed to a “technical error.” The unanticipated release included a warning of “more gradual” growth for ASML, which said it expects 2025 revenues to come in between $32.7 billion to $38.1 billion, well below consensus analyst forecasts of $39.1. New York-listed American depository receipts of ASML stock lost 17.5% during Tuesday trading, the worst loss since March 2020 and the second-worst day of the last decade for the stock. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains the second-largest company in the world, trailing only the $3.5 trillion iPhone maker Apple, which hit its highest ever share price Tuesday morning. After finishing 2023 as the S&P 500 index’s best-performing stock with a blistering 239% gain, Nvidia is again the biggest winner so far in 2024, gaining 167%. The surge comes as Nvidia reports exponential earnings growth thanks to “insane” demand for its graphics processing units, the semiconductor technology which powers generative AI applications at companies like Meta and Tesla. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO since he cofounded the company in 1993, is the world’s 11th-richest person thanks to his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, according to Forbes’ estimates. Huang’s net worth fell $5 billion due to Tuesday’s dip. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Apple Stock Rises To All-Time High—And Record $3.6 Trillion Market Cap

The world’s largest company got even bigger Tuesday, as Apple set a new record share price as the Silicon Valley titan enjoys an extended bump from the release of the artificial intelligence-forward iPhone 16. Pedestrians pass an Apple store in Shanghai over the weekend. Shares of Apple rose as much as 2.7%, setting a new intraday record of $237.49. It’s the first time in exactly three months Apple stock hit an all-time high. Though the stock pared gains slightly to 1.7% by 11 a.m. EDT, trading at $235.33 per share, it’s still on track to break the July 16 record close of $234.82. Apple’s market capitalization rose to as high as $3.61 trillion, the highest valuation ever recorded by a public company, breaking its own July record. There was no singular major catalyst driving up Apple’s share price, and it certainly wasn’t a product of a broader big tech rally, as shares of fellow trillion-dollar West Coast firms Nvidia (-4.4%), Microsoft (-0.4%), Alphabet (up 0.1%), Amazon (-1.3%) and Meta (-1.3%) largely struggled. It was likely a continuation of continued optimism from analyst supply checks on the iPhone 16 released last month to Wall Street concerns about global demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said iPhone lead times, a proxy for the smartphone demand, are “encouraging” and the 56 million iPhones shipped last month was about 10% higher than expected, indicating about $2.5 billion in marginal quarterly revenue upside. Apple also announced Tuesday its first new iPad Mini tablet since 2021, a model emphasizing AI applications. A pair of major events will come later this month: The Oct. 28 launch of Apple Intelligence, the iPhone operating software focused on AI, and quarterly earnings after market close Oct. 31. Analysts expect the AI push from Apple will boost its financial performance, with analysts predicting record third-calendar-quarter revenues of $94 billion and net income of $24 billion.

Title: Nvidia Stock Rise May Boost Its Value Past Apple’s To $3.9 Trillion

WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 27: NVIDIA founder, President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about the ... [+] future of artificial intelligence and its effect on energy consumption and production at the Bipartisan Policy Center on September 27, 2024 in Washington, DC. Huang said that machine learning uses a large amount of energy but that artificial intelligence will save energy in the long run due to it's efficient computing abilities. Founded in California in 1993, NVIDIA is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Nvidia could soon pass Apple as the world’s most valuable company. While Nvidia — which grew 122% in the second quarter — has been the leading economic beneficiary of demand for generative AI since 2023, Apple — whose top line increased 4.9% in Q2 — still scrambles for AI relevance. It may not be long before Nvidia’s superior innovation skills — which I described in my book, Brain Rush — could help propel the AI chip designer’s stock market capitalization ahead of Apple’s market cap. Nvidia appears poised to surpass Apple’s market cap as soon as next month. How so? Were Nvidia and Apple shares to keep rising at their respective 187% and 25% rates so far this year, the AI chip designer’s stock market capitalization would surpass Apple’s current $3.52 trillion next month — reaching $3.92 trillion, according to my estimates. Nvidia stock could keep rising. Were the stock to sustain its 187% growth for the next year (to Apple’s 25%), I estimate the AI chip designer could be worth $9.7 trillion by next October — more than twice Apple’s $4.4 trillion. Here are the forces that could propel Nvidia’s rise: To be sure, Nvidia does face headwinds. Its revenue growth rate — while high — is decelerating from 122% in Q2 to 8o% this quarter, according to my September Forbes post; companies are struggling to make AI payoff, noted the Boston Globe; and conflict in Taiwan could make it challenging for Nvidia’s manufacturing partner to produce chips. However, analysts are increasingly optimistic about Nvidia’s future potential. If you already own Nvidia stock, hold on. If not, there could be plenty of upside ahead. Nvidia got my attention in May 2023 after forecasting shockingly fast revenue growth during the company’s second-quarter report. Since then, Nvidia’s market capitalization has way more than doubled — adding about $2.4 trillion in the past 17 months. Cloud service providers’ demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units — driven by their desire to build and deploy AI chatbots — spurred me to write Brain Rush. While Nvidia’s revenue has “more than doubled in each of the past five quarters — and at least tripled in three of those periods,” according to CNBC, analysts expect the company’s expansion to slow to about 82% — and yield $32.9 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in October, according to London Stock Exchange Group. Nvidia has continued to push the edge of the GPU envelope — most recently launching the Blackwell chip. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are among the companies purchasing Nvidia’s GPUs “in massive quantities to build large clusters of computers for AI,” according to CNBC. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently described demand for Blackwell — the company’s next-generation AI GPU — as “insane” and the company “expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter,” noted CFO Colette Kress, in a report by TheStreet. The market for chips to build and operate AI chatbots is accelerating. Earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices estimated the market for these AI accelerators was growing even faster than the company estimated last year. AMD guesses the market could reach $500 billion by 2028. That’s a 25% increase from the company’s prior forecast — and it represents 62% compound annual growth from 2023 when the market was valued at $45 billion, noted TheStreet. Nvidia controls a huge portion of that market. Analysts at Mizuho estimate Nvidia has a whopping 95% share of the market, CNBC reported. Why is Nvidia leading? “Nvidia benefits from its superior chip performance, strong scaling capabilities, and large installed base, which supports enterprises with multicloud strategies,” noted Citigroup analyst Atif Malik, according to TheStreet. As customers invest more capital in systems to build AI models, Nvidia’s share of that capital is rising. Recent events have made large companies more sanguine about investing in generative AI. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities and Alphabet is also working on such a model. Moreover, Microsoft is expected to boost capital expenditures by about 33% to $58 billion, according to Bloomberg. Moreover, Nvidia’s recent optimism about Blackwell has relieved concerns for some investors. “There had been questions about the impact production delays could have, so these updates are reassuring,” Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Martin Currie Investment Management, told Bloomberg. Indeed Blackwell orders are solid. Orders for the new chips “are booked out 12 months or so,” with “every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility,” noted Morgan Stanley analysts who met with management, according to Bloomberg. Reasoning-based AI could be a large new product category for Nvidia. “When you consider how compute-intensive it is, this could be a huge new product category,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, Bloomberg noted. Therefore, Nvidia could capture more of cloud services providers’ capital expenditures. By selling both its legacy Hopper GPUs and its new Blackwell platform, Nvidia’s share of that spending could rise. How so? Malik estimates Nvidia GPUs will grow 118% in 2024 and 84% in 2025 — giving the company 31% of all capital spending from U.S. cloud providers in 2024 and about a 35% share in 2025, TheStreet wrote. Demand for AI chips could continue as rivals fear being left behind. Companies building AI chatbots face “a Prisoner's Dilemma — each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are devastating,” TD Cowen analysts wrote in an October 13 report, reported Reuters. Nvidia’s success is a result of innovation excellence. The company earns higher margins than rivals because its chips work better, it has the best engineers, its R&D produces a plethora of innovations, and its software for chip developers is unrivaled, according to my September Forbes post. Deploying those innovation skills, Nvidia will continue to upgrade its AI accelerators annually. In 2025, the company plans to announce its Blackwell Ultra chip and to introduce Rubin, a next-generation platform, in 2026, CNBC reported. What could go wrong for Nvidia? With such high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could plunge if the company does not beat revenue targets for the third quarter and raise guidance when it reports quarterly earnings next month. Global conflict in Taiwan could make it difficult for TSMC, Nvidia’s manufacturing partner, to produce chips as Yahoo! Finance noted. Such concerns did not stop one analyst from raising his price target for Nvidia to $150. On October 14, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari raised his price target for Nvidia by $15 arguing Nvidia would “likely benefit from the increasing complexity of AI workloads,” according to TheStreet.

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high, challenges Apple as world's most valuable company

What just happened? There have been plenty of warnings recently that Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last 22 months is about to come to an abrupt end, but we're still not seeing any signs of it happening. Team Green's share price has just hit an all-time high as it looks set to once again take the title of world's most valuable company. Nvidia's share price has been climbing since January 2023, back when it was $14.86. The company provides an estimated 80% or more of the advanced GPU hardware used for training and running AI models, such as the A100 and H100 series. With the generative AI revolution in full swing, Nvidia stock is now at an all-time high of $138.07, an 829% increase over the last year and a half. The price rise means that Nvidia's market capitalization has now hit $3.39 trillion. That puts it in second place on the list of largest companies by market cap, above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion and just below leader Apple's $3.52 trillion. Nvidia will almost certainly unseat Apple as the world's most valuable company if the current trend continues. It wouldn't be the first time that Jensen Huang's firm has been in this position. In June, the company briefly overtook Apple and Microsoft at the top of the rich list. Courtesy of companiesmarketcap.com It was reported last week that overwhelming demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs had led to a 12-month backlog. Companies such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google have purchased every Blackwell GPU, which includes the B200 GPU and GB200 Grace super chip, that Nvidia and its manufacturing partner TSMC can produce for the next four quarters. To help meet Blackwell demand, Nvidia is partnering with Foxconn to significantly boost availability. The Taiwanese manufacturer said it is constructing the largest GB200 production facility in the world in Guadalajara, Mexico. Nvidia will be relieved to see its stock price reach a record high, considering there were warnings that the AI bubble had burst last month. A report on the state of the manufacturing sector and claims (which it later denied) that Nvidia had received a subpoena from the Department of Justice as part of an antitrust probe wiped $279 billion off the company's market cap, the largest one-day drop in US history. But it didn't take long for the firm to recover. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Plus: Fintech App Trap: Enraged Customers Struggle To Cancel Their Subscriptions Good morning, Private equity is betting big on an unexpected place: Big Sky, Montana. In addition to the exclusive Yellowstone Club, which Forbes featured recently, Boston real estate investment firm CrossHarbor Capital made two acquisitions in 2013, eventually turning Big Sky Resort into one of the largest ski resorts in the country, with some 5,800 skiable acres. Altogether, CrossHarbor has spent at least $4 billion over the past 15 years, in a town with only 3,300 full-time residents. Big Sky saw rapid growth during Covid due to Montana’s relatively lenient restrictions and easy access to the outdoors, though it’s slowing down. Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images The S&P 500 notched another record Monday on the second anniversary of the bull market, and is just 2.3% shy of hitting 6,000. It’s a remarkable 68% gain from its low point in October 2022, as corporate earnings growth proved resilient despite high rates and inflation moderated from a four-decade high. Shares of Nvidia increased by more than 2% Monday, ending at a record close and encroaching on Apple’s standing as the world’s most valuable company. The company’s market valuation is now around $3.4 trillion, trailing Apple’s $3.5 trillion, as the chip giant’s shares are up 19% so far in October. Devin Nunes Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of former President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, spiked more than 18% Monday, adding more than $500 million to Trump’s net worth. Trump, who owns 57% of Trump Media shares, was worth $5.5 billion as of late Monday, according to Forbes’ Real Time Billionaires tracker. MORE: Even after its recent surge, Trump Media’s stock has been a disaster for many investors, but it’s enriched its CEO and former Congressman Devin Nunes. Since leaving the House of Representatives to take over Trump Media in January 2022, Forbes estimates that Nunes has raked in roughly more than $2 million in salary, $600,000 in cash bonuses, plus shares worth another $3.2 million. In total, Forbes estimates that Nunes has made about 13 times as much money running Trump’s tottering social media company than he would have if he had stayed in Congress. Getty Images Fertility startups have seen their ads about in-vitro fertilization and egg freezing blocked or restricted across TikTok, Google and Meta, according to leaders of multiple reproductive health companies. On the one hand, these giant platforms have valid reasons for their strict advertising rules, often stemming from the need to meet complex legal requirements of regulations in healthcare and medicine, as well as user safety and privacy laws. But some companies and brands in the space see these decisions as censorship—in a post-Roe v. Wade era, even topics like fertility care have become politicized. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working with Carahsoft, a billionaire-owned government contractor that helps tech companies provide their software to the Pentagon, giving it a path to defense contracts. But the government contractor was recently accused of price-fixing on Department of Defense contracts. A majority of economists believe Vice President Kamala Harris’ proposed economic policies would lead to lower inflation than those of former President Donald Trump, according to a new survey published by the Wall Street Journal, though voters are far more split on who would best handle inflation. Perhaps the most notable and potentially inflationary policies from Trump are his proposed tariffs of 60% on Chinese goods and 10% on other imports, while Harris’ economic proposals include $6,000 child tax credits and $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. Both presidential candidates have rolled out a variety of tax proposals in the leadup to the election: Harris’ proposals include expanding the child tax credit, providing tax credits for first-time home buyers and developers building affordable housing, and increasing taxes on corporations. Meanwhile, Trump recently said he would end double taxation on Americans living abroad and allow interest on car loans to be tax deductible. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes; Photo by Rawf8Getty Images TOPLINE TomoCredit, a six-year-old San Francisco startup backed by investors including Morgan Stanley and Mastercard, promises to boost consumers’ credit scores by, among other things, helping them report additional on-time payments to the credit bureaus. But along with other startups, it’s also the target of hundreds of online complaints. Tomo CEO Kristy Kim says the company has about 100,000 paying subscribers. And over the past year, consumers have filed 557 complaints to the Better Business Bureau about the startup. To put that level of customer dissatisfaction in perspective, PNC Bank, the sixth largest bank in America with more than 10 million customers, received 599 Better Business Bureau complaints over the same year. Most of the complaints against Tomo filed in August and September cited problems with canceling the service. To be fair, the hard-to-cancel problem isn’t unique to fintechs. In March 2023, the FTC proposed a broad “click to cancel” rule requiring it be as easy for a consumer to cancel a subscription service as it is to sign up for it. The commission received 1,163 public comments and has yet to issue a final rule. But it’s worth noting that many fintech startups have promoted their mission as serving consumers who are left behind (or mistreated) by traditional financial firms. That makes the cancellation issue particularly troubling. WHY IT MATTERS The fintech industry’s reputation has taken a hit this year with a spike in regulatory enforcement actions and the failure of banking-as-a-service provider Synapse exposing the chinks in fintech “banks’” FDIC insurance claims. The subscription cancellation problem at multiple startups could become yet another black eye. MORE Is Your Money Really Safe In An ‘FDIC-Insured’ Fintech Account?

Title: How Eli Lilly Outpaces Nvidia—Here Is One Chart

Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images Move over, AI. The real bubble brewing isn’t in artificial intelligence—it’s in weight loss. Wall Street has been hyperventilating over Nvidia and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But another titan has started to inflate. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s talk about Eli Lilly. There’s something curious about the chart below. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI revolution, has seen its share price skyrocket. But Eli Lilly’s stock has been on an even wilder ride. It’s not just its share price that’s eye-popping. Eli Lilly’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings, has also ballooned up into uncharted territory. What’s fueling the meteoric rise? Obesity. The Effects of Scientific Thinking on Startup Success If data is the new oil and AI is the new energy, then losing weight is the final moonshot. Eli Lilly has been in the limelight among investors thanks to its obesity drug, Mounjaro. But here’s the problem: Eli Lilly isn’t the only game in town. Enter Novo Nordisk and its heavyweight contender, Ozempic. Eli Lilly doesn’t own the obesity market. Not the way Google dominates the search market. Or Microsoft dominates enterprise software. Obesity drugs are a duopoly at best. There’s Eli and there’s Novo. Just like Pepsi vs. Coca-Cola. Despite this, investors seem to have made up their one-track mind. Eli Lilly’s P/E ratio is more than double that of Novo Nordisk. Meanwhile, other pharmaceutical heavyweights like Roche, J&J, and AstraZeneca are trading at industry-average P/E ratios of around 30. What’s going on? Let’s channel the wisdom of Peter Lynch. He’s the legendary fund manager who penned One Up on Wall Street. He told us how much he had avoided hot stocks. The higher something climbs, the harder it will fall, he believed. In Lynch’s world, a high P/E ratio isn’t inherently bad. But it does mean all the high growth prospects have already been priced into the current share price. And for Eli Lilly to trade at double that of Novo Nordisk, it means investors are expecting Lilly to grow twice as fast in the coming years in a boxing ring situation against Novo. And Lilly would grow three times faster than the industry average as a drugmaker. Why are investors and analysts so smitten? I think it’s the collective escalation of commitment—a fancy way of saying that once Wall Street falls in love with a stock, it tends to double down. Analysts who have previously issued “buy” recommendations may be reluctant to backpedal. Institutional investors who have bought in, if they were to unload, would have a lot of explaining to do. And if three national magazines have fawned over the CEO, no one is going to stick their neck out singing another tune until something clearly is not working. Maybe one more sinister boost came from the FDA. It recently issued guidelines forbidding pharmacies from compounding “me-too” products that mimic the branded obesity drugs. During the shortages, pharmacies were allowed to manufacture alternatives with the same active ingredient, essentially allowing them to infringe on patents temporarily. Then last week, the FDA abruptly declared that the shortages of obesity drugs are over. So no more copycat stuff. Even though, of course, there are still lingering supply chain issues. Patients reportedly cannot access the needed drugs. The branded version is far more expensive, so those who had been able to afford the medication, now may no longer. I can’t tell for sure, but the FDA surely appears to be cozying up to Big Pharma. It looks as if it’s out to protect incumbents before they’ve even sorted out their operational hiccups. I don’t know if the government is looking out for consumer interest in broadening access or saving the corporate bottom line. Bad optics, that’s all I’ll say. For long-term success, Eli Lilly—or any company, for that matter—needs to perform in the short term while transforming for the long haul. That means sorting out current supply chain issues, meeting market demand, and investing aggressively in the next technological platform. Remember Angry Birds? Kids and adults were all playing until suddenly they weren’t. Being a one-hit wonder is a risky business model. Every novelty wears out eventually. Obesity drugs might be the hot ticket now, but patents will expire, competitors can catch up, and markets always move on. One of the hardest but most crucial strategies for a company riding high is to temper market expectations. It might seem counterintuitive—why would you want to downplay your success? Because you want to create room to exceed those expectations, which is far better than the alternative. Overdeliver, underpromise. Expectation management 101. Mark Zuckerberg provided a masterclass in this. When Apple changed iPhone privacy settings, Facebook’s ad revenue slowed. Instead of sugarcoating the situation, Zuckerberg came clean. In fact, he screamed and shouted about how bad the situation would be. He tempered Wall Street’s expectations. That gave time for Zuckerberg to build better predictive algorithms. Fast-forward a few years, and Meta is back on track. And he has even had the spare money to invest in the Metaverse, then the beautiful Ray-Ban goggles, and now Gen AI video software for Facebook users. Same thing for Netflix and Spotify. They were both once go-go stocks that went down and made a second comeback with a more realistic P/E. The second time, they came back with strong earnings and stronger revenue. Not just an inflated P/E. All bubbles eventually burst. The question isn’t if, but when. At the end of the day, sustainable growth beats a fleeting high every time. You can also sleep better at night. And as history has shown us, the bigger the bubble grows, the louder it bursts. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: OpenAI’s revolving door risk factor

Good morning. Looks like Night at the Museum is becoming a tad more realistic. Cambridge University’s Museum of Zoology is using AI to let dead animals, like a cockroach and a fin whale skeleton, tell their own stories. “Part of the experiment is to see whether, by giving these animals their own voices, people think differently about them,” assistant director Jack Ashby told the Guardian. Maybe, but that AI-infused dodo faces some tough conversations about the fate of its species.—David Meyer Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. OpenAI took a big hit when its longtime chief technology officer, Mira Murati, abruptly left earlier this month. Now the buzzy AI company is facing another Murati-related crisis: She’s reportedly trying to poach current OpenAI employees for her next gig. What that gig involves is unclear, according to tech news site The Information, which cites two anonymous sources. Murati hasn’t told the potential hires whether the job would be at an existing company or a planned startup. Mysterious, right? The intrigue comes as OpenAI’s research division undergoes a leadership shakeup that has prompted several researchers to request transfers to other teams. Adding to the upheaval is the fact that another researcher recently left the company. Meanwhile, OpenAI is also trying to fend off an exodus of employees to a startup created by OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, who announced his exit in May. Of course, OpenAI isn’t always on the losing end of the recruitment wars. On Monday, Microsoft said Sebastien Bubeck, its vice president of generative AI research, was leaving to join, yes, OpenAI, in which Microsoft is a major investor. —Kali Hays Do you find $3,500 an excessive price for Apple’s Vision augmented-reality tech? According to Bloomberg, Apple is preparing a $2,000 little sibling to the Vision Pro—and as you might guess, they’re cutting a few corners. The biggest omission would be that of the “EyeSight” feature, which shows (not very convincing) representations of the user’s eyes on the headset’s exterior. The materials would apparently be cheaper and the processor “inferior," Bloomberg reports. The Vision Pro hasn’t been a massive commercial success, and Apple needs to show it’s a worthy competitor as Meta makes inroads into the lower-priced portion of the headset market with its Ray-Ban smart glasses. And now that Meta has given a preview of its next-generation Orion smart glasses, with augmented reality lenses, Apple can't afford to sit still. The cheaper (though still expensive) Apple Vision headset could apparently go on sale next year. —DM SpaceX has made history yet again. On Sunday, Elon Musk’s space outfit launched one of its giant Starships for the fifth time—and then caught the returning rocket booster. The Super Heavy booster came back down to the Mechazilla launch tower from which it came, with Mechazilla’s robotic arms capturing the hovering Super Heavy in a “chopstick” maneuver. “Even in this day and age, what we just saw—that looked like magic,” said SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot. Or just darn good science. This has huge implications for rocket reusability, and they got it right on the first try. That’s genuinely impressive. —DM Adobe is joining the wave of companies pushing into AI video. Kind of. On Monday, it introduced its Firefly video model across several new tools, as a test. One tool is called Generative Extend, which lets users add up to two seconds to their existing videos or make small adjustments to them. Video makers can use it to add more footage of someone walking or to fix the tilt of their head, for example—all without having to reshoot the scenes. The tool is available through Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe also debuted tools for creating up to five seconds of video by entering text prompts and also for turning still images into video. These two tools, available as a test through Adobe’s Firefly app, compete with products from Runway and with OpenAI’s Sora, which has been showcased publicly, but isn’t yet available. Clearly, users won’t be able to make full-length movies, or even short-form ones, with Adobe’s new AI video tools. But it’s a start.—Sharon Goldman Just when you thought tech IPOs were dead, along comes Horizon Robotics. The company, which is expected to make its public market debut this week, seems purpose-built for the moment. AI bona fides: check! Triple-digit revenue growth: check! Big name backers: check! But don’t look to the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange for this listing. Horizon Robotics is a Chinese company and it’s listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. According to Bloomberg, Chinese tech giants Baidu and Alibaba have already committed to buying shares in the offering, which is expected to raise $800 million and value Horizon at $6 billion. China and the U.S. may be locked in a cold war over AI chips and technology, but when it comes to IPOs, it's advantage Beijing. — Alexei Oreskovic —Google likes nuclear too. Following in the footsteps of Amazon and Microsoft, the search giant announced a plan to get nuclear power for its datacenters. —U.S. weighs capping exports of AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to some countries. Rationing to avoid China diversions. —Inside Amazon’s massive robot rollout—a grand labor experiment with so much at stake.

Title: The rise — and fall? — of the New Progressive Economics

The US presidential campaign is in its final weeks and we’re dedicated to helping you understand the stakes. In this election cycle, it’s more important than ever to provide context beyond the headlines. But in-depth reporting is costly, so to continue this vital work, we have an ambitious goal to add 5,000 new members. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Progressives conquered economic policy under Biden. Would they lose it under Harris? by Andrew Prokop When Kamala Harris gave her campaign’s biggest economic speech yet in Pittsburgh last month, she tried to keep everyone in her party happy. She did not succeed. Attempting to strike a balance between progressive and pro-business themes, Harris said she’d hold corporations accountable if they didn’t play by the rules — but opined that “most companies are working hard to do the right thing.” She referenced the activist presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but in calling for “experimentation” rather than sweeping transformational change. Rather than being “constrained by ideology,” Harris said, she’d seek “practical solutions to problems” and “applying metrics to our analysis.” The speech had little populist fire to be found, and, coming amidst extensive courting of Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors by Harris’s team, it set off alarm bells among some on the left. “My God,” the progressive economist Hal Singer wrote on X afterward. “We lost Kamala.” The “we” is an alliance of advocates that has, over the past 10 years, come together in a surprisingly successful project to reshape the Democratic Party’s economic agenda. Some wanted to take on Big Tech and Big Business. Others wanted the government to revive US manufacturing, while ditching free trade and getting tougher on China. And others wanted big new spending on social policy. But these advocates joined to fight a common enemy: neoliberalism. They sought to discredit the pro-free market and government-skeptical assumptions — and some of the specific people — that they argue drove economic policy in the Clinton and Obama years. The status quo, they believed, had hurt the American people and backfired on Democrats electorally. In both the inside game of Democratic Party politics and the outside “war of ideas,” these post-neoliberals triumphed during the Trump and early Biden years — converting many party elites to their cause, securing key appointments, and shaping what became known to some as the New Progressive Economics. The reformers went from irrelevant underdogs to well-organized, well-funded practitioners of hardball power politics shaping national policy. “This was an astonishing success, a seizure of some of the commanding heights of policymaking,” the historian Quinn Slobodian wrote in 2022. Harris’s ascent has thrown all this into question. Some are urging Harris to undo some of Biden’s changes and steer the party closer to where it was in the Obama years — for instance, by being less hostile to big business and big tech. These critics point to Biden’s unpopularity, arguing that the new agenda has been tried and failed. So far, Harris’s team has tried to keep both the reformers and their critics happy, sending signals to each camp suggesting she’s with them. But for now, winning is her top priority. “I don’t think she has an economic philosophy, and I don’t think she wants to have one until she wins the election,” one advocate in close contact with the campaign told me. (This article is based on conversations with policy experts, advocates, and former government officials, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely.) But Harris and her party will have to choose a path forward if she wins. And understanding the present crossroads requires reckoning with why Democrats adopted this agenda in the first place. Did the New Progressive Economics rise due to fundamental political shifts — or was it something of a fluke in a historical moment that has now passed? And, on both the politics and the substance: Did it succeed, or did it fail? The transformation of the Democratic Party began during Barack Obama’s second term, when some progressive thinkers and activists’ disappointment and frustration with his administration boiled over. The country had recovered from the Great Recession, but slowly. Banks were now somewhat more regulated, but Obama hadn’t fundamentally transformed the finance sector or punished bankers with prosecutions. Progressive critics believed this was because Obama’s top appointees, like Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, were too sympathetic to finance and too beholden to the old economic establishment’s thinking. The critics argued that there were far deeper problems with the US economy that required far more sweeping change. But what change, exactly? Inspired in part by Occupy Wall Street and its “We are the 99 percent” slogan, “inequality” became a new funding priority of progressive donors and foundations. “There was an understanding starting to form that the economy wasn’t delivering,” Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, told me. Much of the rethinking was happening in Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s orbit. Warren, a Harvard law professor and consumer law expert, had come to Washington in late 2008 to help Congress oversee the bank bailouts; she soon won national fame with her tough questioning of both bankers and Obama officials like Geithner. Warren’s pet idea for a new consumer protection agency made it into law, and Obama gave her a temporary gig setting that agency up. But when she asked Obama if he’d give her the job permanently, he declined, arguing — likely correctly — that she couldn’t be confirmed by the Senate. “I was disappointed, but not surprised,” Warren later wrote. The natural solution was to run for Senate herself; she won her Massachusetts seat in 2012. Yet, nearly two years into her term, and after dismal 2014 midterm results for Democrats, Warren was frustrated — Obama’s team, she thought, still seemed beholden to the old ways. So she started to pick fights. She sank Obama’s nomination of Antonio Weiss, an investment banker, for a Treasury Department position, and gave a fiery speech blasting a financial regulation rollback in Congress’s year-end spending bill. Warren believed “personnel is policy,” and that Obama was simply appointing and listening to too many of the wrong people. Warren also began to look beyond Wall Street in her desire to find what ailed the American economy. She embraced a theory, pushed by a small group of writers and advocates like Barry Lynn, Lina Khan, Matt Stoller, and David Dayen, that the problem wasn’t just finance but also Big Tech and big corporations generally. Traditional antitrust policy had been that the government should intervene when corporate concentration raised prices for consumers. But these advocates wanted to rethink and expand the concept of antitrust — to make it about challenging the concentration of corporate power, even when the companies in question (like Amazon) offered low prices to consumers. This was the start of the new antitrust movement. Warren’s outspokenness caught Hillary Clinton’s attention. Wary of a primary challenge from the left, she arranged a sit-down with Warren, in which the Massachusetts senator made clear what she really cared about: She didn’t want Wall Street’s preferred appointees, and she had her own list of people she liked better. Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong campaign amped up the populist pressure on Clinton. Yet instead of endorsing Sanders, who few believed could win, Warren remained neutral during the primaries, preserving her chance to play an inside game with Clinton afterward. Talks between Warren’s and Clinton’s camps continued up to Election Day. The Roosevelt Institute established itself as a progressive competitor to Democrats’ favorite think tank, the Center for American Progress, and sent along Warren-friendly names: binders full of progressives. Warren had made herself someone that Democratic leaders couldn’t ignore. “In early 2014, nobody cared at all what our side thought because there was no credible threat and no pain inflicted,” a former Warren aide told me. “By 2016, they did care — because there was a credible threat and there was pain inflicted.” A Clinton transition official backed up this assessment, telling Politico, “It was kind of a pain in the ass to be thinking about her all the time.” Still, though she and her allies had won a seat at the table, they weren’t at the head of the table just yet. Trump’s 2016 victory came as a seismic shock to Democrats. Party elites were so stunned by Clinton’s defeat that they began to question their fundamental assumptions about how politics worked. The establishment was grappling for answers; some of them looked in the mirror and wondered: Was this our fault? A well-funded effort to convince them that it was indeed their fault soon materialized. Influential progressives who wanted to challenge the party’s consensus saw opportunity. Larry Kramer, the head of the Hewlett Foundation, launched a heavily-funded effort to discredit neoliberalism as an “intellectual paradigm.” The Ford Foundation, having already reoriented its giving around inequality in 2015, joined in. The Omidyar Network (funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) began its own push to “reimagine capitalism.” So during the Trump years, money flowed into think tanks and advocacy groups old and new, in a project inspired by conservative donors’ decades-long project of building a right-wing counter-establishment. In his book The Middle Out, journalist Mike Tomasky dubbed this an “increasingly at least semi-vast left-wing conspiracy” — a “network of people and groups” that “helped change the economic conversation in dramatic ways.” Close ties developed among many of these thinkers and experts, many of whom had nonprofit posts but hoped to enter government or influence appointments later on. Hewlett and Omidyar grants also funded new centers at universities and projects at certain media outlets (including this one — the Omidyar Network funded two Vox reporting projects in 2019 and 2020, though they had no editorial oversight over these projects). A key figure in this grant-making effort was Jennifer Harris, who headed the Hewlett Foundation’s grantmaking on economic issues. Harris had come to progressive economics from an unusual direction: through foreign policy. She was a national security hawk who, while working at the State Department, came to believe that the US’s longtime approach to trade deals had been disastrously captured by big corporations — that it had hollowed out important domestic industries and posed serious strategic risks in a new era of great power competition with China. Harris concluded that flawed and outdated neoliberal thinking was failing the country on many fronts. “Paradigms like neoliberalism function at a society level,” she told me. “Their power derives precisely from how many of their premises are taken for granted, and for how much consensus they enjoy, across the ideological spectrum.” The world, she continued, was at a “dangerous” juncture, due to “the return of great power competition and the urgency of climate change.” With Hewlett’s grant-making, Harris wanted to help shape a new intellectual paradigm to more effectively grapple with these new challenges. She funded many left critiques of neoliberalism, as well as a few from the right. Between 2017 and 2024, the Hewlett Foundation spent tens of millions of dollars to develop alternatives to neoliberalism. Grantees included: Progressive think tanks: Hewlett funded policy work at the Roosevelt Institute ($5.8 million), Washington Center on Equitable Growth ($6.1 million), Economic Policy Institute ($1.4 million), Demos ($1.1 million), and the Center for Economic and Policy Research ($615,000). The new antitrust movement: Grants went to Open Markets ($750,000), the American Economic Liberties Project ($450,000), and the Economic Security Project’s Anti-Monopoly Fund ($1.3 million). Groups on the right: Hewlett funded the policy group American Compass ($2.9 million) and the journal American Affairs ($1.2 million), which challenged the right’s free-market thinking. Media: Hewlett funded coverage of and reporting projects about new economic thinking at the Atlantic ($1.3 million), Boston Review ($1.9 million), and the American Prospect ($665,000), though it did not have editorial oversight over such coverage. Academia: Hewlett funded new research initiatives or centers on the economy at Harvard ($7.5 million), Yale ($4 million), Johns Hopkins ($15 million), Howard ($10 million), UC Berkeley ($9.8 million), and MIT ($7.5 million). But what, exactly, would the new agenda entail? For one, many progressives embraced Warren and her allies’ antitrust push. So did Democratic leaders, who were seeking populist policies as their party was turning against Big Tech. After the leading new antitrust movement activists had been controversially ousted from the New America Foundation think tank, they formed new advocacy groups that won Hewlett and Omidyar funding. Onetime blogger Matt Stoller became particularly influential on this topic — through his book Goliath, an email newsletter, and his pugnacious Twitter presence, he hammered home the message that Big Tech and big business were at the heart of the country’s woes. Warren, who has praised Stoller as “a brilliant thinker and writer,” released a plan to break up Big Tech companies in 2019, near the start of her own presidential campaign. But beyond aligning with the Warrenites, Jen Harris also began to help shape another pillar of Democrats’ agenda: a new industrial policy, in which the government would intervene in the economy by financially supporting key industries — with strings attached. Good free-market neoliberals had historically disdained this idea, believing government attempts to meddle in the economy would have bad results. But industrial policy appealed to several important Democratic constituencies. Labor wanted more US union jobs. Climate change activists wanted money for the clean energy sector. National security hawks wanted to challenge China. Political operatives thought it might play well in the Rust Belt. Much of the business community might be happy about it too — after all, it involved giving US companies money. Democratic policy wunderkind Jake Sullivan liked what Jen Harris — and Elizabeth Warren — had to say. In line for a top policy job under Hillary Clinton, Sullivan had been one of those undergoing a dark night of the soul since 2016. He had considered a top lobbying job at Google, but instead chose to work at nonprofits rethinking the policy agenda. And by June 2018, he sounded excited about what he was seeing. “There’s something profound happening in American politics right now,” Sullivan wrote in Democracy. He asserted the country was at a “turning point,” disillusioned by free-market excesses and open to bold new policies. “Democrats should not blush too much, or pay too much heed, when political commentators arch their eyebrows about the party moving left,” he continued. “The center of gravity itself is moving, and this is a good thing.” The left did not technically win the 2020 Democratic primary, as Joe Biden — the most old school of the major contenders — emerged triumphant over Sanders and Warren. But Biden embraced the new agenda anyway. He had long been close to labor and skeptical of pointy-headed economists from elite universities. (“He’s so old,” Felicia Wong of the Roosevelt Institute later said, “that it turns out he’s actually pre-neoliberal.”) Now, amid the deepening pandemic crisis, the idea of an “FDR-size presidency” sounded appealing. Key aides around him, like Ron Klain and Bruce Reed, agreed that bold progressive thinking was needed, and Sullivan became the campaign’s top policy adviser. Wong was named to the transition team. Other progressives wanted to hold Biden’s feet to the fire from the outside once he won. Warren’s chief of staff Dan Geldon departed her office, starting a firm pushing opposition research about potential appointees he deemed unreliable. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project frequently disparaged potential nominees as corporate hacks and sellouts. Such attacks often showed up in the American Prospect and the Intercept, two publications solidly aligned with the new agenda. Hewlett or Omidyar money helped fund the links in this chain — the semi-vast left-wing conspiracy was at work. (Its participants argued they were fighting against far greater corporate money and influence.) The good-cop, bad-cop approach succeeded. Champions of the new progressive economics such as Jen Harris and many Warren allies scored key White House and regulatory posts. Biden’s Cabinet secretaries were more traditional Democrats, but when they tried to staff their agencies, their picks were often overruled by the White House in favor of alternatives preferred by the Warrenites. The new antitrust movement scored particularly big, though it took some hardball. Biden got Lina Khan confirmed by the Senate as an FTC commissioner and only afterward revealed he’d make her the commission’s chair; Republicans (and some Democrats) were shocked that the 32-year-old calling for a total rethink of antitrust policy would be in charge. Reformers also wanted attorney Jonathan Kanter, a longtime critic of Google, for the top Department of Justice antitrust job. Attorney General Merrick Garland initially seemed disinclined to follow their counsel — but when word leaked out that Garland was considering other contenders, articles slamming them appeared in the Prospect and the Intercept. Kanter got the gig. Quickly, Biden’s administration took on a different character from Obama’s. ”Economists and financiers are simply far less influential,” Ezra Klein reported. The nonprofit world and labor leaders rose in influence. So did elite progressive lawyers: the Biden administration was chock-full of Yale Law grads, including Sullivan, Khan, and Jen Harris. (Twenty-five of Harris’s Hewlett grantees got Biden administration jobs, according to Tomasky’s book The Middle Out.) Progressives’ appointment success took on particular importance because Biden took a hands-off approach to economic policy. It was “very, very rare,” a former administration official told me, for a decision memo outlining different courses of action supported by different economic aides to be sent to the president. Biden would offer his feedback on policy plans during briefings; but staff would typically send “joint recommendation memos” that he’d then sign. In practice, that gave staff great freedom to shape policy, so long as they could agree with each other. When the Hewlett Foundation hosted a conference on the future of neoliberalism, several Biden administration officials attended. So did the American Prospect’s Bob Kuttner, a longtime, often-lonely critic of the economic policy establishment. Afterward, Kuttner marveled: “I never thought I’d live to see a time when my allies were in charge of the government.” With Democrats in control of Congress for the first time in a decade, the party wanted to make the most of their governing majority — and that meant going big. They started off with a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill for pandemic recovery. Economists like Larry Summers complained that this was far too big — that its size seemed to go far beyond what economic analysis suggested was necessary, and that it could worsen inflation. Democrats in Congress and the administration dismissed these warnings, not wanting to repeat Obama’s mistake of spending too little. The rest of the Democrats’ big bold legislative agenda ran into the constraints of a 50-50 Senate. Republicans helped pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, but for other progressive priorities, Democrats had to tailor their plans to the restrictions of the budget reconciliation process (which bypasses the filibuster). Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) then nixed the sweeping social spending in the Build Back Better plan. But in the summer of 2022, Manchin did approve massive new clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. Republicans also signed onto the CHIPS Act, a bill to award billions in grants to bolster a US semiconductor manufacturing industry. The bill was meant to address national security risks about the current Taiwan-centered supply chain, which was vulnerable to a future conflict with China. This was part of a broader Biden administration hardline toward Beijing that included tariffs and dramatic limits on semiconductor exports. The IRA and CHIPS Act meant the industrial policy agenda championed by Jen Harris had made it into law, and she helped steer its implementation in the administration. Meanwhile, Khan and Kanter swung into action on antitrust, suing Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Google, among other companies. Both became key to what the administration dubbed “Bidenomics” (and the New York Times would later dub Harris “The queen bee of Bidenomics”). But now that the new agenda was actually being implemented, its critics began to speak up — while its inherent tensions became more evident. Khan’s FTC tenure was cheered by progressives but controversial among agency staff and deeply loathed by business. She was criticized for bringing cases that seemed doomed in court — winning such cases would depend on persuading judges of new legal thinking, a project of years or decades. Khan and Kanter’s main impact was deterrence: fear of expensive investigations helped chill mergers and acquisitions. Democratic policy now appeared to be that big business shouldn’t get bigger. Meanwhile, the new industrial policy was sending billions in tax credits and grants to big US companies, which was a bit incongruous. Indeed, Warren and her allies increasingly looked askance at the CHIPS Act grants being made by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who they viewed as far too eager to send money out the door with insufficient oversight. Progressives wanted to attach stringent labor, environmental, and social justice standards to such payouts. Others argued that demanding too much — the tendency Ezra Klein dubbed “everything-bagel liberalism” — could hamper the new industries from being built. (So far, spending on factory construction has doubled, but we are still years away from seeing whether these businesses will succeed.) The nitty-gritty of implementation also made clear that no one approach could make every constituency happy. Climate hawks complained about the administration’s tariffs on Chinese clean energy companies. Auto workers making gasoline-powered cars objected to a push toward electric vehicles. National security doves worried Biden’s China policy was too provocative. Unions’ interest in creating high-paying US jobs naturally clashed with corporate incentives to lower manufacturing costs. And did the administration really want to bolster US companies to help them compete globally — or did it want to take those companies down a peg? Yet in the public mind, the new economic agenda was largely overshadowed by a problem the reformers had not anticipated: the highest inflation in four decades. It was the neoliberals who had warned about this, while the progressives were caught flat-footed, as was the Biden administration. “People don’t like inflation and we got a lot of it,” economist Adam Ozimek told me. This was a global phenomenon and not primarily caused by Biden’s policies, but the administration was slow to adjust and made it somewhat worse. “The stimulus was way too large, it came out all at once, and they proceeded to follow it with a variety of spending packages,” Ozimek said. He added that the economy is now in a good place after hefty interest rate hikes, but that we took a “chaotic path” getting there. In the end, Biden’s economic policy ended up historically unpopular. That’s left a chasm between progressives who tout Biden’s presidency as one of the most productive and consequential in recent history, and a public deeply unsatisfied with his record. Perhaps the anti-Biden sentiment was more about his age, foreign crises, and inflation that mostly wasn’t his fault — but it’s hard to blame it on neoliberalism. Shortly after Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, a factional contest for influence kicked off when billionaire Reid Hoffman — who had donated millions to elect Harris — publicly declared that she should replace Lina Khan at the FTC. Progressives responded with outrage, rallying to Khan’s defense and demanding Harris pledge to keep her in place. Harris has not yet taken a position on Khan’s future. Many believe Harris will be friendlier to business, and especially to Silicon Valley, than Biden was. These fears tend to center around Harris’s brother-in-law, Tony West, who is Uber’s chief legal officer and has become an important Harris campaign adviser. West has been cultivating Wall Street and Silicon Valley support for the campaign, sending the message that Harris would be an ally to the business community. More broadly, some center-left commentators argue the time has come for a rethink of Democrats’ rethink. Jonathan Chait proposed that Harris should revert to something more like the policy and politics of the Obama years (since Obama was a more popular and electorally successful president than Biden), while Matt Yglesias argued that the backlash against neoliberalism has “mostly served in practice as a way to tell people that it’s okay to do sloppy economic analysis.” Warren’s allies, meanwhile, were somewhat wrongfooted by Harris’s ascent, as they had not built much of a relationship with her. An incident last year where Warren sounded unsure on whether Harris should stay on the ticket as Biden’s running mate reportedly led to some tension between their respective camps. Still, some early signs suggested Harris might continue the Biden-Warren approach. In August, her campaign announced that their economic advisory team would include Biden’s former National Economic Council director Brian Deese, and Bharat Ramamurti, a one-time Warren aide who had been Deese’s deputy. The reformers were initially encouraged when, in mid-August, Harris proposed a “federal ban on corporate price gouging” to combat high grocery costs. “I was really surprised and pleased that she pointed at big food corporations as a causal factor in higher food prices,” Matt Stoller told me shortly afterward. But centrist pundits criticized the idea, Republicans accused Harris of proposing socialistic price controls, and the campaign soon put out word that the policy would have limited impact. Later that month, Harris’s advisers said she supported a proposal to tax unrealized capital gains (stock that had appreciated but not yet been sold) for people worth more than $100 million. It was a way to raise revenue and hit the wealthy; in a CNBC appearance, Ramamurti defended the idea from skeptical anchors. But investors were furious. Soon afterward, billionaire investor Mark Cuban, a prominent supporter of Harris in close contact with the campaign, insisted that she wouldn’t actually go through with the idea, because it would “kill the stock market.” As the campaign has gone on, Harris’s economic line has appeared to some to grow more cautious. Her policy plan promises a lot of new and expanded tax credits, and would raise taxes on corporations and the very wealthy, but says relatively little about expanding the welfare state. She offered an olive branch to cryptocurrency companies — in contrast to top Biden appointees and Warren, who wanted to crack down on the industry. Harris has talked about cracking down on corporate “bad actors,” but emphasized that those are the exception. When I followed up with Stoller in late September after Harris’s Pittsburgh speech, his mood was one of deep pessimism. “I think she’s gonna do what rich people — billionaires — want,” he told me. The campaign’s economic proposals, Stoller said, were “a mishmash of nonsense.” The progressives who had joined the campaign’s economic team, he now believed, didn’t “have any real influence” and were only included to throw a bone to critics on the left. “I think this is the Tony West show,” he said. “And if she wants to make it clear that it’s not, she needs to say so.” If Harris won and returned to neoliberal thinking, Stoller argued, the consequences would be “a failed presidency,” “intraparty war” and perhaps even “losing a war with China.” (After we spoke, Stoller called me back to say he was speaking for himself and not his employer, and that his views on Harris’s campaign changed day-to-day.) Others were more optimistic, or at least agnostic. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project told me while he was “concerned” about Harris’s rhetoric and apparent friendliness to the cryptocurrency industry, he was cautiously optimistic that Harris would keep Khan and Kanter in place. “There isn’t really a meaningful policy apparatus and the transition is extremely barebones and noncommittal,” Hauser said. “So it’s hard to know what is real versus what will turn out to be smoke signals that are entirely irrelevant.” The antitrust agenda, reformers worry, could be dropped or seriously weakened. But for industrial policy, the question is less whether it will continue than what it will look like. Reformers fear it will become a corporate subsidy program in which the priorities of labor and other progressive interests take a backseat — that is, that it could start looking a lot more neoliberal. Meanwhile, the world has changed from the Trump years. On a range of issues, the leftward movement of Democratic politicians and voters appears to have abated. Personnel changes and strategy shifts have occurred at the foundations and think tanks that pushed the new progressive economics. New topics, like AI, have risen to the top of the agenda, and need to be hashed out. For instance: should the US boost domestic AI development as part of security competition with China, or is any big AI company so dangerous that it should be regulated within an inch of its life? The post-neoliberals’ level of influence in these debates will hinge on whether they’ve become an inextricable part of the Democratic coalition — or whether their rise under Biden was born of unusual circumstances that no longer exist. A critic of the reformers mused to me that their rise to power may have been largely due to “a lack of supervision” in the Biden White House: “And maybe once the president returns, the whole thing starts to implode.” You’ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Title: It’s the Most Hated Airline in America. You’ll Miss It When It’s Gone.

Time Published: 2024-10-15T09:35:00Z

Not long ago, I found myself in a position every American air traveler is taught to dread: I was about to board a Spirit Airlines flight. Spirit Flight 492 was scheduled to take me from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, not far from the carrier’s headquarters, to Columbus, Ohio, where I was living at the time. My wife and I were flying home from a wedding in South Florida, and Spirit was the easy choice and the cheapest choice. It was also the choice that allowed me to avoid Miami International Airport, one of the few on-ground places I hate more than being in the air. As a perpetually anxious flyer, I dreaded getting on any plane that could make my nerves even worse. Would the horror stories prove true? Would I be able to move in my seat? Would I have to take out my credit card for water? If there were a problem with the flight, would I be trapped in Florida forever? These were not entirely out-of-pocket questions. To understand Spirit Airlines is to understand what it is to be hated—truly despised—by most people. One recent Axios–Harris Poll survey asked Americans about the brand reputations of 100 well-known companies. Spirit ranked 98th out of 100 companies—worse than Meta and TikTok, Fox Corporation, and Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution that failed last year. The only businesses that scored worse? Elon Musk’s X and the Trump Organization. Woof. Spirit’s brand is synonymous with cheapness—in price but also in quality. Its planes are cramped, uncomfortable, and all too often delayed. The airline sets cheap rates but ambushes customers with pesky little fees for every single facet of the flying experience, a nickel-and-diming scheme that bends not even for that glass of water. It’s flying “unbundled”: Start with the worst experience imaginable, then pay up for whatever shreds of dignity you need to feel human. This was actually the reason I decided to board the Spirit flight. Despite my nerves, I was excited to see what all the hate was about. My curiosity had been piqued earlier this year, after Spirit got a hearty endorsement from an unlikely source: a federal judge. On Jan. 14, William Young, a Ronald Reagan–appointed federal district judge in Boston, sided with the U.S. Department of Justice and blocked JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit, a deal that would have allowed two discount airlines that fell on hard times in the COVID pandemic to merge and leverage more power against the so-called Big Four: American, Delta, Southwest, and United. In his opinion, waxing poetic about the beleaguered Spirit, Young wrote that the merger was incompatible with federal antitrust laws, which are aimed at protecting the American consumer from harmful corporate combinations—especially when they raise prices. A combined JetBlue and Spirit would have created the fifth-largest airline in the country, controlling 10 percent of the domestic market. It wasn’t to be. “Spirit is a small airline. But there are those who love it,” Young wrote, explaining why he had sided with the DOJ. “To those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one’s for you. Why? Because the Clayton Act, a 109-year-old statute requires this result—a statute that continues to deliver for the American people,” he added, referring to the longtime antitrust law. Let’s raise a glass to the cheapskate of the sky, the judge seemed to say—the everyman of the flying world, the great equalizer of the skies. Ever since the merger failed, Spirit’s stock has tanked, and its market value has slipped from $6 billion in 2015 to comparative pennies today. Speculation of a collapse has been rampant, and news that Spirit would delay the purchase of more planes and would be cutting certain routes followed. Then, earlier this month, “people familiar with the matter” told the Wall Street Journal that the airline is indeed in negotiations ahead of a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. So wait: If Spirit’s passengers are miserable—and if onlookers at neighboring gates are smirking stupidly, safe in the knowledge that they don’t have the misfortune of flying that dreaded airline, as I swear I experienced in Florida—what makes it so good for people? Why should those Delta flyers with shit-eating grins be grateful for pathetic little Spirit? As I boarded the plane that day, I wanted to know if Young had been onto something. As it turned out, almost every expert on air travel I spoke to agreed: If Spirit does perish, you will miss it. You just don’t know how much it’s already done for you. Spirit was founded in 1964 as a Michigan-based trucking company. It didn’t get into air travel until 1980, when it began operating domestic flights as Charter One Airlines. In the 1990s, it rebranded as Spirit Airlines and relocated from the Detroit suburbs to sunny Miramar, Florida, between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. It wasn’t until 2007 that Spirit became what’s called an “ultra-low-cost carrier,” a business model first pioneered by the Irish airline Ryanair in the ’90s. (This is a step down from a low-cost carrier, such as Southwest Airlines or JetBlue.) Though their models vary somewhat, ULCCs typically offer fully “unbundled” fares. What you see when you buy a ticket online is merely a base fare, and everything else comes at a price. Literally everything else: not only now-familiar extra costs like bag fees, but also any snack or sip of water on board, a fee for seats if you want a guaranteed seat next to a travel partner, and even an additional charge for printing a ticket at the airport. Such airlines’ devious definition of ancillary services kept expanding, and so did the revenue they earned from them, often catching less seasoned travelers off guard. Gerald Cook, an adjunct professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, is a former commercial pilot and flight operations manager who flew for Spirit from 1999 to 2010. He said that before Spirit began unbundling its fees, it was struggling and fairly directionless. “It was hard to say what the business model was,” Cook told me. When Ben Baldanza became the CEO in 2005, he transformed Spirit into a ULCC and, within a few years, made it the most profitable airline in the United States. (Baldanza left Spirit in 2016 and is now a board member at JetBlue.) “It was successful enough that we changed to an all-Airbus fleet. We had a new fleet of airplanes,” Cook said. “The downside under Baldanza was he concentrated so much on aircraft utilization that the reliability and on-time performance was poor.” (Aircraft utilization refers to how many hours a plane flies per day.) Baldanza was proud of the cheapo transformation, calling his airline the “dollar store of the sky.” Seeing Spirit’s success, Frontier Airlines, a regional carrier sold by Republic Airways in 2013, followed its lead and became a ULCC too. Spirit went public in 2011 and expanded rapidly in the years after. Baldanza resigned in 2016, with a $1 million golden parachute and a lifetime of free Spirit flights, and the company has fallen consistently each year for a decade, leading to its current predicament. Cook thinks it grew too fast, taking on too much debt, which left it vulnerable to the pandemic. The company was forced to take out billions in debt during the height of the crisis, from which it has struggled to recover. Cue the merger talks. Frontier itself attempted to buy Spirit for $2.9 billion in a stock-and-cash deal in February 2022, but shareholders rejected the merger mere months later. JetBlue swooped in for Spirit with a $3.8 billion deal, which shareholders OK’d in October 2022. That led to an antitrust battle with the suit from the Justice Department, which culminated in Judge Young’s decision quashing the merger earlier this January. What did Young see in Spirit that the average American air traveler doesn’t? Unlike many of the legacy airlines that carve out specific areas of coverage, Spirit does something incredibly important: It truly competes with every other airline. And that brings down prices for every airline passenger—whether you deign to fly Spirit or not. William McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, was a vocal critic of the merger deal. He told me that ULCCs like Spirit are the only real competition for the big carriers—the one thing that actually reduces their prices. In his opinion, Young hailed the so-called Spirit effect: “Spirit has found that, typically, once Spirit enters a route, passenger demand increases and the average fare on that route decreases.” McGee told me that there are “two Americas”: cities with Spirit, and cities without it. Research has found that Spirit’s entry into a marketplace lowers fares in nearly every case. For example, a 2016 study documented a Houston–to–Kansas City route that was serviced only by United Airlines. Tickets on average went for $300—until 2014, when Spirit also began to service the route. Spirit offered fares closer to $90, and United was forced to bring the average fare down to $180, according to the study. This effect was seen again and again in routes across the country. “If the JetBlue merger had gone through, I can guarantee you that the following Monday morning, fares would be much higher on American and United—because American and United have this mosquito bothering them,” McGee said. “That’s how the big guys look at them. They’ll do everything they can to squash them.” It’s hard to directly analyze how the airlines compete because they’re often after different kinds of customers, said Kevin Williams, a professor of economics at Yale University. “To many people, JetBlue and Spirit have pretty different operations,” he said. “They have very different products. They’re presumably going after very different customers.” Still, by going full cheapo, the legacy carriers are able to compete more directly for cost-conscious flyers. You can see the effects of Spirit’s competition when you travel with a legacy carrier. If you’ve flown Basic Economy on American, Delta, or United—that lowest option where you cannot select your seat, you board last, and even if you have loyalty membership you’re not eligible for upgrades—you can thank Spirit. But Basic Economy is still often a higher price point than Spirit’s base fare, even with a few add-ons. In that way, Spirit offers access to a customer segment that, without those cheaper-than-cheap flights, might drive instead of fly, or might not take a trip at all. “Spirit is basically the only choice for lower-income Americans on routes,” McGee said. “For a lot of people, it’s a question of whether or not you’re gonna see your grandparents, or the grandparents are gonna see their grandkids. If Spirit’s not there, then they’re not going.” Even for the people who do shell out for the more expensive flight rather than Spirit, the benefit is still there. If you’re traveling on a route Spirit also services, you can bet you saved money from the mere fact that it was an option. In Fort Lauderdale, I boarded a good-as-new Airbus A320neo wrapped in Spirit’s signature black-and-yellow design, and I must report: It was totally fine. That is the experience of the vast majority of people who fly Spirit. It is fine—excellent safety, capable air crews, planes that are clean and well maintained, if not exactly comfortable. Indeed, on board, the jet-black seats were thinly padded and deeply uncomfortable, but otherwise the major new annoyance of the flying experience involved taking out my credit card to pay for a snack. By now, many consumers are aware that’ll happen on Spirit. But some, especially less experienced flyers, have no idea. And they certainly don’t know what’ll happen if their plans change. Then you’ll have to find out just how seriously Spirit takes its “nonrefundable” fares. If you search Spirit online, you can see the results: The Better Business Bureau and Consumer Affairs pages for the airline are littered with reviews claiming “terrible,” “unprofessional,” and “fraudulent” practices. A common refrain: Never again. Furious customers have even turned to Yelp, typically where you go to gripe about a soggy taco or brusque waiter, to lash out at the airline, which currently sits at 1.4 stars out of 5. The accusations are myriad, but many boil down to the same complaint: They had a problem, and when they contacted customer service, Spirit told them exactly where they could shove it. By 2013, Spirit’s reputation had gotten to the point where it inspired a classic Onion headline: “FAA Report: Spirit Airlines Is the Fucking Worst.” To Spirit, this is a feature, not a bug. The airline declined to make any executives available for interviews for this article, but in the past, top executives at the company have been almost gleeful in enforcing its rules at any cost. There was the time when a customer complained that a flight delay to Atlanta (fare: $78) had caused him to miss a concert and demanded damages. Baldanza mistakenly—or not—replied all to a customer service thread: “We owe him nothing as far as I’m concerned. Let him tell the world how bad we are. He’s never flown us before anyway and will be back when we save him a penny.” Then there was the time, as recounted in the Wall Street Journal, that a 76-year-old Vietnam veteran found out he had terminal cancer and was told not to fly. Too bad, Spirit told the dying veteran: “Nonrefundable’s nonrefundable, and that’s it.” Only after a national campaign on Facebook and television coverage did Spirit budge, but even then, only kind of: The airline never issued a refund, but Baldanza paid the man back out of his own pocket, and Spirit made an undisclosed donation to a veterans group. The current Spirit CEO, longtime executive Ted Christie, has been more magnanimous in public—he acknowledged the chaos mass cancellations caused in 2019, for example—but Spirit’s foundational unwillingness to give in to customers who feel wronged has not noticeably shifted. The reason why—and the reason to be sympathetic, even if you have been personally screwed by Spirit—is that Spirit and its ilk believe themselves to be the only airlines genuinely trying to shake up the flying market and make it better for everyone, customers and investors alike. On this point, Christie has been far more outspoken. After the merger with JetBlue was blocked, he declared on an earnings call, “The Big Four are the beneficiaries of this new normal. American consumers are the long-term losers.” He said the American airline industry “seems ever more like a rigged game.” Judge Young, in his opinion, seemed to agree with Spirit in, er, spirit—the ultra-low-cost carrier has been a boon for competition in an industry the Atlantic earlier this year called “dangerously consolidated.” But the decision in effect has threatened its existence. So while the pugnaciousness of Spirit can feel anti-customer, there’s also something pious in the bad blood it’s willing to endure. As the bankruptcy looms, we may soon find out what a world without Spirit—or a much different Spirit—looks like. Plenty of customers who have been wronged over the years will probably cheer the news when it comes. At least until they have to book their flights home for Thanksgiving next year and see the prices. In the end, my biggest mistake was that I spent too much money on Spirit. The one-way flight for two cost me $343.64. I paid for a so-called Just For You bundle, which included a checked bag, shortcut boarding, and the ability to pick my seat. That was another $120. I paid an additional $34 to upgrade my seats to ones in an exit aisle with extra legroom. And since we had a long weekend of wedding travel that took us from Ohio to Maryland to Florida, we had a lot of bags—some checked, some carry-on. Bringing those along cost $116. Oh, and then there was $52.54 in taxes. Once on board, I had work to do. I coughed up $15.99 for Wi-Fi—much more than most airlines charge—and $9.98 for Pringles and a can of ginger ale. My total cost: $692.15, or $346.08 per person. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do Spirit. Fly Spirit when you have minimal bags, have minimal needs, and just need to get somewhere as cheaply as possible. If you fly and expect all of the amenities of a legacy airline, you’ll be able to rebundle the total cost—and more. In my case, this was a comparable price to flying with a legacy carrier, and it didn’t require me to wait many, many hours or voyage to Miami, which would have added costs and stress. So I’m rooting for Spirit. I hope a bankruptcy doesn’t mean the end of those yellow-and-black planes next to haughty Delta and United jets. I hope any restructuring maintains the bad-mannered airline poking the others in the eye. In fact, I’m planning another trip on Spirit soon—and I’m going to do it right next time. I’m going to fly with little, ask for nothing, sit in my crappy little seat, and admire the miracle of modern commercial flight. And if I need a ginger ale, or something stronger, to settle my nerves, I’m going to appreciate that this airline of less-than-stellar repute has made flying cheaper for me for years. I can afford to throw them a buck or two for a bag of pretzels. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2024 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high, poised to surpass Apple in market valuation
URL: https://www.techmonitor.ai/silicon/nvidia-shares-hit-record-high-poised-to-surpass-apple-in-market-valuation/

Shares of Nvidia reached a record high on Monday, positioning the Santa Clara-based chipmaker close to surpassing Apple as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s stock rose by 2.4%, closing at $138.07, as investors continued to back strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) processors. The graphics processing units (GPUs) maker briefly held the title of the world’s most valuable company in June, before being overtaken by Microsoft. For several months, the market valuations of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have remained competitive, with their values closely aligned. Nvidia’s recent gains brought its market value to $3.39 trillion, just trailing Apple’s $3.52 trillion, while Microsoft’s stands at $3.12 trillion, reported Reuters. Nvidia has been a significant beneficiary of the ongoing competition among leading technology companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon to establish dominance in the growing AI technology sector. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that the major players in AI face an environment where each is driven to invest due to the risks of being left behind. TD Cowen, in a report on Sunday, reiterated its price target of $165 for Nvidia, highlighting the company’s strong demand for its AI processors and naming it their “Top Pick.” The firm also addressed Nvidia’s recent confirmation in August regarding delays in ramping up production of its upcoming Blackwell chips until the fourth quarter. Nvidia indicated that existing processors were still in high demand. The rise in Nvidia’s shares coincided with gains for Apple and Microsoft, which saw increases of 2% and 0.7% respectively, contributing to the S&P 500 index (.SPX) reaching a record high close, up 0.8% on Monday. Together, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft account for around 20% of the S&P 500’s weighting, substantially impacting the index’s performance. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which manufactures Nvidia’s processors, is set to release its earnings on Thursday, with analysts predicting a 40% increase in quarterly profit, driven by growing demand. Spending on AI data centres is expected to boost Nvidia’s annual revenue to nearly $126bn, according to LSEG data. Although Nvidia’s strong performance has lifted the S&P 500 to new highs, concerns remain among investors about the possibility that optimism around AI could fade if spending on the technology shows signs of slowing. In contrast to the high valuation achieved in recent days, Nvidia faced a significant setback in September as its stock decline erased $279bn in market value amid concerns about AI investments. The sharp drop was triggered by a disappointing quarterly outlook that missed investor expectations, raising worries about slower-than-expected returns on AI investments. At that time, Nvidia experienced a historic single-day loss as shares fell 9.5%, leading to a $279bn reduction in market capitalisation, marking the largest one-day decline for any US company and surpassing Meta Platforms’ $232bn loss in February 2022. For Q2 FY25, Nvidia reported a GAAP net income of $16.6bn, a 168% year-on-year increase, with total revenue reaching $30bn, up 122% from the previous year. For Q3 FY25, Nvidia forecasted revenue of approximately $32.5bn, with a potential variance of plus or minus 2%. Give your business an edge with our leading Tech Monitor

Title: Is Microsoft Stock Heading To A $4 Trillion Valuation? Taking Cues From Buyback And Dividend Hike Plans

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) After a jubilant runup to all-time highs, Microsoft (MSFT) shares are taking a pause subsequent to a protracted period of AI optimism for big techs. The tech giant’s elevated levels of AI capital spending that have yet to translate into tangible returns appear to be causing some unease among investors. Exacerbating the concerns, growth in Microsoft’s much-hailed Azure cloud services during the recent fourth quarter was perceived as weaker than expected. The beginning of a Fed rate easing cycle is also motivating investors to look beyond the overheated valuations of mega techs. Microsoft recently announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend alongside a mammoth share buyback program of up to $60 billion. Is the Microsoft stock a buy in view of its dividend hike and stock buyback plans? Where is the Microsoft stock headed? Is a $4 trillion valuation in the cards for the MSFT stock? After touching a 52-week intra-day high of $468.35 on July 5, the stock receded and closed at a low of $394.44 on August 5 following its fourth-quarter earnings release on July 30. Although MSFT reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter, the market chose to focus on the shortfall in its Azure cloud revenues. Azure is a key area of focus for analysts, as it competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Microsoft is going head-to-head with the other two for capturing new business. The investments towards Azure AI growth, drive a significant portion of the capex spend for MSFT. So, it’s good to know that AI services contributed 8 percentage points, accounting for more than a fifth of the growth in “Azure and other cloud services” revenue during the fourth quarter. In response to an analyst’s query in the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Microsoft attributed capacity constraints for impacting Azure growth, noting that AI demand remained higher than available capacity. These capacity restrictions alongside softness in non-AI consumption in some European geographies are expected to continue into the first half of fiscal 2025. However, Azure growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025, as capital investments should increase available AI capacity to serve the growing demand.

In July, Microsoft noted that its revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% year over year during the fourth quarter. (Typically, Microsoft does not disclose the dollar value of revenue for this category.) The growth was 30% in constant currency (assuming constant exchange rates) in line with Microsoft’s guidance for 30% to 31% growth, but fell short of the 31% growth pegged by analysts. It caught the market off-guard as Azure growth numbers have never missed estimates since 2022. The lack of visibility into cloud consumption trends also poses a problem. The Azure consumption business (in which businesses only pay for the resources and services consumed), which includes AI, has historically grown faster than the per user business. However, Microsoft typically features the slower-growing per-user pieces in the Azure and other cloud services’ revenue stream, complicating the visibility into the consumption of Azure. However, in August, Microsoft updated its reporting structure to enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI for the overall business. Under the new reporting framework, the slower growing per-user revenue streams such as the Power BI data analytics tool and the Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) product suite will be excluded from the closely monitored Azure and other cloud services metric. With the relocation of these two components, the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to the consumption business. However, Microsoft will be adding revenue from its search and news advertising category into Azure and other cloud services. So, the updated Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric will include revenue from Azure and other cloud services, including cloud and AI-consumption based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings and other cloud services. Subsequent to the reclassification, Microsoft restated its investor metrics, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth and updated its first-quarter guidance. Based on the restatement, revenue from Azure and other cloud services for the fourth quarter grew 34% to 35% in constant currency (vs. 29% to 30% growth in constant currency reported in July). For the first quarter, revenue growth for the new Azure and other cloud services is expected to be 33% in constant currency (vs. prior projections for growth of 28% to 29% in constant currency in July). Based on the takeaways from the July earnings call, there appears to be no slowdown in demand for Azure consumption. The quote from Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood, “Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure.” has a nice reassuring ring to it. With the reorganization in reporting structure, the upcoming first quarter earnings print will likely offer more helpful context on how Azure is shaping up for the second quarter and future periods. Microsoft’s intelligent digital assistants called Copilot streamline workflows. Copilot can help draft emails and reports, summarize documents, provide data insights, create presentations, generate software code and automate repetitive tasks. About 60% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Copilots. Copilot is used in GitHub (which is a code-sharing platform) for providing AI assistance in software coding. More than 77,000 organizations have adopted GitHub Copilot, and the number is up 180% year over year. The use of Copilot has pushed GitHub’s annual revenue run rate to $2 billion and accounted for 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is gaining solid traction; customers grew more than 60% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of people who used Copilot daily at work doubled. The number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis and EY, which alone is expected to deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. Copilot is still in the nascent stages of growth, but already showing great promise as a future driver of recurring revenue growth for MSFT. With the rollout of additional features and functionality, Copilot is expected to deliver even greater value. The Copilot add-on for Microsoft 365 plan costs $30 per user per month, while a basic business subscription for Microsoft 365 costs $6 per user per month, a standard business subscription costs $12.50 and a premium business subscription costs $22.50.

During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft addressed the elephant in the room–the raging industry debate about the monetization of its significant investments in generative AI. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, totaled $55.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (including $11.2 billion in first-quarter 2024, $11.5 billion in second-quarter 2024, $14 billion in third-quarter 2024 and $19 billion in fourth-quarter-2024) up 75% year over year. A bulk of the capex spend is towards cloud and AI-related investments. Microsoft said that nearly 50% of its capex went towards infrastructure needs, like the land and data center buildout, while the rest was decided by “demand signals.” CPUs or GPus will be bought only based on these demand signals. Azure AI growth, and recurring customers for Microsoft 365 Copilot are some of the demand signals that decide the trajectory of more than 50% of Microsoft’s capital spending toward cloud and AI-related investments. While responding to an analyst’s question, Microsoft said it could see consistent revenue growth even without this sort of elevated capital expense because of the variable nature of the capex. In what could be viewed as an elaboration on the demand signals, Microsoft said it witnessed record commitments to its Microsoft Cloud platform in the fourth quarter and commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations rising 17% (and 19% in constant currency) year over year, thanks to growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Microsoft has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year with the average spend per customer continuing to grow. Microsoft said that the expansion of its data center footprint targeting investments across four continents aimed to create long-term assets globally to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. Fiscal 2025 capex is expected to be higher vs. fiscal 2024, and tied to demand signals and adoption of its AI-based services. MSFT plans to be more disciplined to keep its opex growth in the single digit for fiscal 2025 to somewhat compensate for the higher capex. Besides, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion for fiscal 2024, resulting in an attractive free cash flow (FCF) generation of approximately $74 billion, even after the escalated spending. Strong FCF generation characteristics render solid support for Microsoft’s capital spending plans. MSFT appears to have adequately addressed the concerns regarding its capex boost for fiscal 2025. It is now up to investors to take a deep, long look and decide if they are comfortable with the answers. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% during the fourth quarter, of which 58 points were attributed to Activision. The acquisition of Activision has given Microsoft a strong content pipeline and a foothold in mobile gaming, a turf where it virtually had no presence before. In gaming, Microsoft now has more than 500 million monthly active users, across devices and platforms. Microsoft’s official cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming, allows a user to play native console games in the cloud and stream it to a phone, PC, or console. The game catalog for Xbox Cloud Gaming has more than 200 titles including a number of EA Play games that make it quite appealing for users. Xbox Cloud Gaming is only available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, a service that costs $19.99 a month. For the first quarter, Xbox content and services revenue is expected to grow in the low to mid-50s percentage. Gaming could likely turn out to be a good revenue avenue, amid the projected growth in the global cloud gaming market from an estimated $5.8 billion in 2023 to $9.7 billion in 2024, thanks to the rise in mobile cloud gaming, according to Fortune Business Insights. Microsoft has made partnerships the cornerstone of its growth strategy. To understand the economic value partners realize through their collaboration with Microsoft and its technology—particularly with AI, IDC conducted a global study (commissioned by Microsoft). A key finding of this web-based global survey of 638 Microsoft partners was the “partner multiplier” metric. For every $1 of Microsoft revenue, Microsoft partners who provide services generate $8.45 and partners who develop software generate $10.93. This compelling number could spur further partner-led growth for MSFT. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft noted that it “continues to prioritize security above all else.” It has more than 1.2 million security customers. “Defender for Cloud”—MSFT’s cloud security solutions for protecting customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the past year (as of July 31, 2024). It is interesting that Nadella should reinforce MSFT’s commitment to prioritize security above all else. On July 18, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a flawed software update, crashing millions of Windows devices. Microsoft pegged this estimate to 8.5 million Windows devices representing around 1% of all Windows machines. However, many of these customers were providers of critical services, like airlines and Banks. Although the outage was caused by the CrowdStrike update, Microsoft may likely face some pushback about the perceived chinks in its operating system. Of course, other risks include Microsoft not meeting its AI objectives and the subsequent repercussions that could stem from it. Cloud revenues and operating income for the latest June quarter: New data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, shows that second-quarter enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services totaled $79 billion globally, up 22% year over year. Amazon remained the market leader during the June quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Microsoft’s lead in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is narrowing. Microsoft had a head-start advantage in the space through its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. However, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic (the creator of Claude LLMs) and Google’s introduction of its Gemini model are leveling the playing field. Although ChatGPT remains the most popular chat-bot currently, experts opine that the offerings from Anthropic and Google have demonstrated superior performance vs. ChatGPT on various benchmarks. While Amazon and Google are playing catchup with ChatGPT, MSFT is adding its own in-house data center-bound AI chips, the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator for training and running AI models, and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU, which is optimized for general purpose workloads. As of now, MSFT accounts for nearly 20% of Nvidia’s revenues, while Google and Amazon represent about 5% each. With its own AI chips, MSFT has the potential to close the much-touted cost advantage with AMZN and GOOG. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. The new buyback authorization, which represents nearly 2% of MSFT’s market cap of $3.1 trillion, has no expiration date and replaces a $60 billion buyback program announced in 2021. Shareholder return initiatives are not new for Microsoft, which returned more than $34 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in fiscal 2024. The company has repurchased shares consistently over the last two decades. However, the new buyback authorization does signal that the tech giant remains committed to robust free cash flow generation, despite its elevated AI-driven investments. Atop the battle for AI dominance, the top tech majors are also actively competing on buyback and dividend programs, which bodes well for shareholders. In May, Apple announced the biggest-ever $110 billion stock buyback authorization, following Google parent Alphabet’s $70 billion buyback authorization announcement in April. Microsoft ranks third so far this year in terms of buyback size. In February, Meta authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases, which represented 5% of its $1 trillion market cap at the time. Meta’s market cap has since grown by 50% to $1.5 trillion. Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend payout by 10% or 8 cents to $0.83 per share from the present $0.75 per share and made the announcement in mid-September along with the buyback plans. The dividend is payable to shareholders on December 12. MSFT stock goes ex-dividend– the cutoff date for new buyers of the stock to be eligible for the upcoming dividend–on November 21. At current stock prices, the new dividend has a forward yield of nearly 0.8%. Here’s a fun fact. Every year, the new quarterly dividend increase tops the year-ago dividend increase by a penny–a pattern that can be observed since November 2021. For example, the upcoming new dividend is $0.83 per share, a 8-cent increase from $0.75 per share in 2023, which is a 7-cent increase from $0.68 in 2022, and this represents a 6-cent increase from $0.62 in 2021. Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades now. This compares very favorably with the sector’s ten consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Considering that Microsoft has consistently paid and increased dividends, there isn’t much in the way of surprises that would significantly impact MSFT stock behavior—unless Microsoft were to halt or cut its dividend payments. Such a move could serve as a notable negative catalyst, though the probability of that occurring is extremely low. Currently, Microsoft distributes more than 25% of its annual earnings as dividends, which seems safe and sustainable for now. Earnings reports, company developments and competitive dynamics have a stronger sway on MSFT’s stock price. Amid the pressure to show payoffs on their huge AI capital spending, other mega techs are turning more shareholder friendly. In February, Meta joined the throngs of Apple and Microsoft, by initiating its first-ever dividend of 50 cents per share, which would be paid on a quarterly basis. After the dividend announcement on February 1, META stock closed 20% higher on February 2. Google parent Alphabet initiated a cash dividend of 20 cents per share in April and the stock gained 10% the next day. Amazon is the only major tech that does not offer a dividend yet. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the MSFT stock with an average price target of $496, which represents roughly an 18% upside from current stock price levels of around $420. MSFT stock has no Sell ratings and a few Hold ratings. Goldman Sachs (GS) maintains a Buy rating but reduced the price target on Microsoft to $500 from $515. GS expects 14% revenue growth for the first quarter, inline with the consensus, and sees EPS of $3.14, slightly above the consensus. Oppenheimer downgrades Microsoft to “Perform” From “Outperform,” citing higher-than-expected losses from Microsoft’s OpenAI investment and slower enterprise adoption of AI technology. Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to “Neutral” from “Buy,” keeping the price target unchanged at $475, citing concerns over the narrowing AI lead of Microsoft vs. rivals Google and Amazon, and MSFT’s heavy reliance on Nvidia for AI infrastructure. Jefferies is keeping its Buy rating, and price target unchanged at $550, citing the strong performance of Azure, and the promising trajectory of the M365 Copilot initiative. MSFT is 10% off its 52-week intraday high reached on July 5. After more than doubling in value over the past two years, a 10% correction in the MSFT stock is not exactly devastating. It could also be an opportunity to buy into a quality, futuristic business with the stock headed for new heights. In the near-term, there’s a very high likelihood of the Microsoft stock revisiting its highs, given an upcoming key catalyst, Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings report scheduled for release on October 30. In the longer run, AI is here to stay and is not going anywhere in a hurry. By building an evolving AI ecosystem around its products, MSFT is positioning itself as a major force within AI and cloud services. The market is in the “show me the money” mode. However, investors should remember that data centers cannot be built in a day and scaling up is a herculean task. Microsoft is definitely making progress and AI investments are already generating additional business for Microsoft, as can be seen by the strong signups for Azure AI and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Analysts expect $140 billion in incremental revenue from AI services for MSFT by 2027. Adding this to the fiscal 2024 revenue of $245 billion, Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027 based on its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 10.6x, representing 30% upside from current levels. Not to forget the long-term dividends and share buybacks that could further unlock value for investors. Microsoft stock is the top holding of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The Trust owns roughly $14.7 billion worth of Microsoft stock, representing about 30% of its $48 billion portfolio. Microsoft has been growing dividends and implementing buybacks over the last two decades. So, the recent buyback/dividend announcement is not expected to have much sway on the stock price. If the stock rallies, it could be attributed to the upcoming first-quarter earnings report slated for release on October 30. It appears that Microsoft has adequately addressed the concerns related to its capital spending in its fourth-quarter earnings call, expounding on the growing demand signals for Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilots and the variable, demand-driven nature of capex. Strong FCF generation characteristics render support to its capital spending plans. The revamp to its reporting structure will likely enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI on the overall business and ease any investor apprehensions. With growth in Xbox Content and Services revenue, gaming will likely shape up to a decent revenue stream as the global cloud gaming market gathers pace. Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027, if all goes as planned.

Atypical of technology stocks, Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades. This compares favorably with the sector’s 10 consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Microsoft has repurchased shares actively over the last two decades. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. Stock buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and offset any dilutive impact for existing shareholders from a past stock offering or stock option exercise. Buyback announcements tend to push up the stock price but not always. Have any buybacks gone wrong?Pharma giant Merck’s shares lost 15% in the month, subsequent to the unveiling of its huge $10 billion buyback program on February 22, 2000. The selloff was because investors believed that the $10 billion could have been put to better use to bolster Merck’s drug pipeline that was running dry. Microsoft pays a dividend with a forward yield of 0.8%. The yield may look small, but that is because of the strong rally in the MSFT stock over the past years. Typically, investors buy the MSFT stock for its capital appreciation potential with lesser emphasis placed on the dividend.

On Monday, Stifel, a financial services company, increased its price target on shares of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) to $663 from the previous $590. The firm has maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The revision follows positive indicators from the company's performance, including a strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter, despite rising costs per thousand impressions (CPMs), which is a standard measure in advertising to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage. The analyst from Stifel noted that advertisers are still achieving the required return on ad spend (ROAS) or better, indicating effective monetization of ads despite the inflation in CPMs. The report also highlighted the Advantage+ suite, Meta's advertising product, which is believed to be still under-penetrated in the market. Positive feedback on the product suggests potential for increased adoption and, consequently, greater budget allocation towards Meta's offerings. In response to the findings, Stifel has adjusted its third-quarter revenue estimate for Meta to reflect a 19.2% year-over-year increase, which is at the higher end of the company's guidance. This is an upward revision from the previous estimate of a 17.5% year-over-year increase. For the fourth quarter, the firm anticipates a 15.5% year-over-year revenue growth, up from the prior estimate of 12.4%. Additionally, Stifel has slightly lowered its total expense assumptions for Meta, bringing them closer to the midpoint of the company's guidance. This adjustment has led to an increase in the forecast for Meta's GAAP earnings per share (EPS) for 2024, now set at $21.37 compared to the previous $20.63. The estimate for 2025 GAAP EPS has also been raised to $25.33 from $23.51. These revisions reflect the firm's confidence in Meta's revenue growth and controlled expense management moving forward. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. saw its shares target raised by both Roth/MKM and Truist Securities, reflecting optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects, despite a cautious stance as the third quarter earnings approach. Roth/MKM raised the stock's price target to $620, while Truist Securities increased its price target to $650. Additionally, KeyBanc raised its stock price target for Meta to $655, maintaining an Overweight rating influenced by advancements in Facebook Reality Labs and artificial intelligence (AI). Meta Platforms also made significant strides in combating disinformation in Moldova, dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting Russian-speaking users in the country. This move is particularly crucial as Moldova prepares for its presidential election and a referendum on joining the European Union. In another development, Meta, along with other tech giants, proposed an alternative power payment plan for data centers in Ohio. This proposal is a response to an ongoing dispute with utility company AEP Ohio over energy usage. As the S&P 500 companies begin their earnings reporting season, investors are keenly observing the financial impact of investments in AI. Meta's investments in AI are anticipated to significantly enhance content ranking and recommendation systems, reflecting positive expectations for the company's upcoming third-quarter earnings. Meta Platforms Inc.'s strong performance, as highlighted by Stifel's analysis, is further supported by real-time data from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.5 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the tech industry. Meta's revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months aligns with Stifel's optimistic revenue projections for the upcoming quarters. InvestingPro Tips reveal that Meta has a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating strong financial health and operational efficiency. This score supports Stifel's positive outlook on the company's performance and expense management. Additionally, Meta's impressive gross profit margins, currently at 81.49%, underscore its ability to maintain profitability even as it navigates rising CPMs in the advertising market. The company's P/E ratio of 29.44 and PEG ratio of 0.23 suggest that Meta may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects, which aligns with Stifel's decision to raise the price target. Investors seeking more comprehensive analysis can access 13 additional InvestingPro Tips for Meta, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market performance.

Title: Trump Media’s Stock Surges as Investors Grow More Bullish on His Chances of Winning U.S. Presidential Election

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of the social media company affiliated with Donald Trump have more than doubled in the last three weeks. Investors in Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social social media network, have rallied behind the stock as online betting sites have increased their odds that Trump will win the 2024 U.S. presidential election. On Monday (Oct. 14), TMTG’s stock price closed up 18.5%, to $29.95 per share. That comes after the stock closed at $12.15 per share on Sept. 23 in the wake of the expiration of a six-month lockup period during which TMTG insiders were not allowed to sell their stock. Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention” of selling his shares. Related Stories VIP+ Latest Music Licensing Deals Underscore Social Media Giants’ Frenemy Status SAG-AFTRA Steps Up Advocacy Efforts for Disabled Performers With 'Time to Get Real' Video Series TMTG, which has posted net losses to date, has not released any notable financial news in the past three weeks that would have spurred the jump in the stock price. Instead, according to analysts, the rise of TMTG’s share price reflects a higher expectation among investors that Trump will defeat VP Kamala Harris in next month’s election, thereby improving the outlook for Truth Social, which is Trump’s preferred social platform. Popular on Variety Trump took the lead over Harris in betting odds for the U.S. presidential election for the first time since their Sept. 10 debate, USA Today reported Monday. Per the report, among the gambling site USA Today regularly surveys, Trump’s largest lead is at BetOnline where the line is Trump -140 compared with Harris at +120. (U.S. bookmakers cannot legally take such bets, according to the report.) “People realize that if Trump gets elected, this stock has the potential to do something,” Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN, adding: “And if he doesn’t get elected, it probably goes to zero.” TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $6 billion, more than doubling since its Sept. 23 lows. The company’s market cap saw an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $3.4 billion. For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but Truth Social remains his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company said in its prospectus. TMTG has not disclosed how many people use Truth Social. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” it said in an updated prospectus filed Sept. 5.

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/14/mag-7-become-drag-7-taking-down-qqq--create-opening-for-q-killers/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T17:28:20Z
Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

Title: One week with the Meta Quest 3S: Five biggest takeways

Time Published: 2024-10-14T13:00:16Z

No offers found It may be the most important VR device of all time. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3S has been a wonderful escape from the clunkiness of life brought about by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene for me. Being able to literally jump into another world by popping a headset on during the day has been more than just mood-changing for me, it’s been an important part of recovery time to return to normal life again. Throughout this, the most impressive thing to me is how little of a compromise this feels when compared to the $200 more expensive Meta Quest 3. While the lenses aren’t as clear, I didn’t notice any other real differences while playing. Even with that in mind, most people won’t be able to appreciate the lens difference unless they’ve already used a Quest 3 before, anyway, so it’s a bit of a moot point. While the experience is unbelievably close to the Quest 3, I don’t want to write a full review after using it for just a week. Instead, I’ve come up with five takeaways and why this should absolutely be the VR headset you buy this year, especially if you’re a Quest 2 owner who’s looking to play games like Batman Arkham Shadow. When I first put the headset on, I marveled at how similar the Meta Quest 3S’s color mixed reality vision was to that of the Meta Quest 3. It was easy to see the room around me, put my controllers on, and interact with things in the room — including petting my kitten who was roaming around. The best mixed reality games all feel and play nearly identically on the Meta Quest 3S. Turning your living room into a racket ball court in Racket Club still feels magical, and unique mixed reality-only games like Starship Home still transform your existing room into something new and special. In fact, I still had that funny feeling of something missing in the room every time I stopped playing Starship Home because the mixed reality quality was so convincing. For Meta Quest 2 owners upgrading to a Meta Quest 3S, color mixed reality will be the biggest, most immediate difference. Mixed reality simply doesn’t exist on a Quest 2. Calling the ultra low-res black & white passthrough vision “mixed reality” is simply inaccurate, and it’s this that will bring that immediate “wow” factor to your purchase. I’ve already been able to play some Quest 3-exclusive games on the Meta Quest 3S that I’m not allowed to talk about yet, but let me tell you that the graphics on these titles are going to blow you away. This is a 100% full generational upgrade from the Meta Quest 2, and it’s immediately palpable on many of the biggest upcoming Meta Quest games. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android While some existing games you might have already played got impressive visual upgrades — The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is one of the best examples of impressive updates to existing games — the new games coming out this year are the ones that’ll truly blow you away. That’s because it’s not just about the upgraded details, better textures, improved lighting, and other graphical improvements. It’s about scale. The extra RAM and 100% improved processing power over the Quest 2 mean that games made for the Quest 3 can feel bigger and more robust. Many Oculus Quest games from the 2019 and 2020 eras often felt like mobile games in a new perspective because of their graphical and environmental simplicity. Meta Quest 3 games feel straight out of the PS4 era of gaming, and that’s something to truly celebrate. From day one, I was able to use nearly every single one of the best Meta Quest 3 accessories (link) that I had on hand with the Meta Quest 3S. The lone exception is the facial interface, which is a different shape and size compared with the Quest 3. But every alternative head strap I had, every controller accessory — including fancy golf clubs and controller grips — and every battery pack or haptic feedback vest worked with the Quest 3S without any tinkering. That means Quest 3S users have access to an entire year’s worth of third-party accessory work, allowing them to choose the best accessory for the job instead of settling with overpriced options that end up disappointing. That's a massive change from every other Meta Quest product launch, which often saw only first-party accessories available for months at a time. If you’re picking up a Quest 3S, I'd recommend two accessories to get a significantly better experience. First, grab a BoboVR M3 Pro head strap replacement. Its brilliant design helps offload the Quest 3S's weight from your face, balancing it better on your head with cushy, easily removable, washable padding. It also includes a magnetically hot-swappable, rechargeable battery pack that adds hours of playtime to your experience. I'm also testing out KIWI Design's H4 and K4 head straps, both of which offer much better comfort over the stock strap while adding a big battery for additional playtime. KIWI Design prides itself on battery safety, which is something to think of since it's strapped to your head! Next, grab these inexpensive AMVR controller grips. They replace the battery cover on your Quest 3S controllers with one that has a grippy texture and a comfortable hand strap. That strap not only more evenly distributes the controller's weight but also makes it easier to throw things in VR since you can actually let go of the controller without it falling out of your hands. I personally dislike the stock facial interface for any Meta Quest headset and often prefer ones from AMVR or Kiwi Design, but neither company has one that works with the Quest 3S yet. Once I use one I like, I'll add a recommendation. We just overhauled our best Meta Quest games list, and let me tell you how difficult it was to narrow down the selection of "best games" to just a few. The Meta Quest platform sports thousands of games, and while plenty of 2024 games have been phenomenal, there are still plenty of classics worth playing. New releases like Dimensional Double Shift put a new spin on the old VR classic Job Simulator by adding in multiplayer and hand tracking, plus a new theme with tons of unique interactions. Metal: Hellsinger VR takes the console classic into VR with a head-banging good original soundtrack and gameplay that feels straight out of the best Doom games. NFL PRO ERA 2025 just upgraded its gameplay and roster to give you the fantasy football experience you've been dreaming of, and Hotel RnR Rockstar Simulator lets you step into the shoes of a rockstar who is fed up with not getting their way all the time. In just a week, you'll be able to play Batman Arkham Shadow, the first original game in the Arkham franchise in a decade. That, of course, is a game for free with the Meta Quest 3S, so you don't have to purchase the game separately. And the upcoming Meta Quest games list is stacked with other big-name releases we're sure to love. Alien: Rogue Incursion is the first made-for-VR game in the classic Ridley Scott series. Skydance's Behemoth brings Shadow of the Colossus-style gameplay to VR, and Metro Awakening is an original VR entry into the acclaimed Metro 2033 series that gamers have loved for years. The worst part of buying any new system is having to shell out a bunch of money to play games on it. That's where Meta Quest Plus comes in. It's a subscription service similar to something like Xbox Game Pass, giving you access to 22 of the best Quest games right away. Each Meta Quest headset comes with a three-month trial of the service, and it's just $7.99 per month thereafter. Here's how it works. A library of 20 games is available to play right away, giving you access to a regularly rotated, curated list of titles. You don't own these games, so be sure to play them when they're available. Beyond that, you'll get access to two games each month that you can claim permanently on your account. That's 24 games per year added to your library and accessible so long as you keep a subscription to the service. That's in addition to the regularly rotated list of 20 games, meaning you'll have plenty to play for just a few bucks a month. Meta absolutely knocked it out of the park with the Meta Quest 3S. This is the Quest 2 follow-up the VR industry needs because it comes in at the price people want. A $299 headset is probably the single most important thing to get VR into more hands and on more heads, and a product as good as the Meta Quest 3S is going to absolutely blow people’s minds this Holiday season. I don’t hesitate at all when I say this is the most important VR product ever made. It takes all the lessons Meta learned from the Quest 2 era, adds in all the improvements made with Quest 3 hardware and the software experience over the past year, and somehow melds them perfectly into a $299 package. It’s an unbelievable feat for the company to have achieved, and yet, here it is for all to enjoy. The VR boom cycle is about to be back in business after a year of slow down, and the Meta Quest 3S is leading the charge. Don't spend more! Get the Meta Quest 3S and get the best of VR gaming and mixed reality content with the same powerful processor in the Quest 3, the same controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and a massive library of content to enjoy every day.

Title: Deutsche Bank reiterates buy rating on Microsoft shares amid concerns

On Monday, Deutsche Bank maintained its Buy rating and $475.00 price target on shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm's stance comes amidst the tech giant's recent market performance, which saw its shares trading below the average of its 'Magnificent Seven' peers based on calendar year 2025 price-to-earnings ratio. The underperformance has been attributed to a shift away from large-cap software stocks and growing questions regarding the return on investment for Microsoft's significant capital expenditures. These concerns are amplified by doubts about the adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the profitability of raw artificial intelligence infrastructure, as well as increased competition faced by OpenAI, Microsoft's partner. Deutsche Bank suggests that Microsoft will encounter heightened pressure to deliver on these fronts in the second half of the fiscal year. However, a strong start in the first fiscal quarter could set a positive tone. Deutsche Bank's analyst pointed out that despite the challenges, the firm believes a solid beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year could help establish a strong base for Microsoft. The reiterated Buy rating and target price suggest confidence in Microsoft's potential to navigate through the current skepticism. The target price reflects a 35x next twelve months earnings per share, compared to the five-year average of 28x. Investors and market watchers may consider this position as a signal of Deutsche Bank's optimism about Microsoft's ability to address the issues raised and capitalize on its investments. The focus now turns to Microsoft's upcoming financial reports and market performance to see if the company can meet the expectations set by analysts and investors alike. In other recent news, Microsoft has been involved in significant developments in the tech sector. The company has partnered with Rezolve AI, aiming to revolutionize the global retail industry with advanced AI solutions. This collaboration targets optimization of retail operations and enhanced customer engagement. Microsoft also announced new AI tools in healthcare, aiming to improve care experiences and enhance collaboration among healthcare teams. In addition, Microsoft, along with other tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has proposed an alternative power payment plan for data centers in Ohio. This proposal is a response to a prior suggestion by utility company AEP Ohio, aiming to establish a more equitable framework for power payment. Microsoft's earnings have shown notable growth, with Goldman Sachs projecting a 14% revenue increase. However, Oppenheimer has downgraded Microsoft's stock due to concerns over higher-than-expected losses from its OpenAI investment. In contrast, Truist Securities has reiterated a Buy rating for Microsoft, emphasizing the company's strength in the cybersecurity sector. These are recent developments in the tech and AI sectors, with Microsoft making significant strides. To complement Deutsche Bank's analysis, recent data from InvestingPro offers additional perspective on Microsoft's financial position. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $3.09 trillion, underscoring its status as a tech behemoth. Microsoft's P/E ratio of 35.07 aligns with Deutsche Bank's valuation metrics, indicating that the stock is trading at a premium compared to historical averages. InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's strong financial health and market position. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns. This is particularly noteworthy given the concerns about capital expenditures mentioned in the article. Additionally, Microsoft is recognized as a prominent player in the software industry, which supports Deutsche Bank's optimistic outlook despite current market skepticism. The company's revenue growth of 15.67% over the last twelve months and a robust EBITDA growth of 26.68% suggest that Microsoft continues to expand its business effectively. These figures may help alleviate some concerns about the return on investment for its significant capital expenditures. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into Microsoft's financial health and market position. These additional tips could be particularly valuable in light of the challenges and opportunities outlined in Deutsche Bank's assessment.
