We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, the Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made significant moves in the market, with prominent trades involving Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) and Block Inc (NYSE:SQ). The Tesla Trade: Ark Invest’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) sold a total of 8,384 shares of the Elon Musk-led company. With Tesla’s closing price at $249.85 on Thursday, the value of this trade amounts to approximately $2.09 million. This move is in line with Ark’s recent trend of reducing its Tesla holdings. Don’t Miss: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000 Wood’s ARK Investment Management sees Tesla's driverless ride-hailing plans as a game-changer, potentially unlocking $11 trillion in revenue by leveraging lower operating costs of electric vehicles. ARK’s analysis suggests that Tesla’s robotaxi service could offer rides at a fraction of current ride-hailing and personal vehicle costs, making it a competitive alternative. The Meta Platforms Trade: Ark Invest’s Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF), ARKK, and ARKW bought a total of 34,076 shares of Meta Platforms. Given Meta’s closing price of $567.58 on Thursday, the total value of this trade is approximately $19.34 million. This purchase comes after the Mark Zuckerberg-led company’s third-quarter earnings report, where the company beat revenue and EPS estimates. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence. The Palantir Trade: Ark Invest’s ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW sold a total of 334,767 shares of Palantir Technologies. With Palantir’s closing price at $41.56 on Thursday, the value of this trade is approximately $13.9 million. This move follows a recent upgrade of L3Harris Technologies, a key collaborator with Palantir, by BofA Securities. The Block Trade Ark Invest’s decision to offload shares of Block Inc. was a notable one. The firm sold 243,549 shares of the Jack Dorsey-led company from its ARKK and ARKW. The value of this trade, based on Block’s closing price of $72.32 on the same day, amounts to approximately $17.6 million. The move came on the same day that Block CEO Dorsey announced a fresh wave of layoffs at Tidal. In a note to Tidal employees, Dorsey stated the need for the company to function “like a startup again,” necessitating a much smaller team across the organization. Interestingly, the trade also comes at a time when Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), a core focus of Block, has been hovering near previously reached all-time highs. Other Key Trades: Ark Invest’s ARKF and ARKK bought a total of shares of Roku Inc. (ROKU). Ark Invest’s ARKK bought shares of Twist Bioscience Corp (TWST). Ark Invest’s ARKK sold shares of Moderna Inc. (MRNA).

At the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, billionaire investor Warren Buffett made headlines with a bold claim about corporate taxes. Noting Berkshire Hathaway's significant federal tax contributions, Buffett suggested that if 800 other companies matched Berkshire's federal tax payments, "no other person in the United States would have had to pay a dime of federal taxes-no income taxes, no social security taxes, no estate taxes."

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) fell an additional 15% on Thursday, trading at $28 per share, following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young. Although the server company joined the S&P 500 in March 2024, this year hasn’t been smooth, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. New economic data will be released on Nov. 1. In life, there’s a common expression that also carries over into the dividend investing world: If it seems too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true. Oftentimes, dividend stocks with 6% or higher yields are yield traps. This means that the dividend income they provide to shareholders seems great, but it isn’t sustainable. Now and then, though, I stumble across high-yielding dividend stocks that aren’t yield traps. I believe that one such example is Pfizer (PFE).

Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher on Friday, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to recover some of its loss from the day before, which was its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 288 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8%. Amazon climbed 6.2% after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher. Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8% despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts’ estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market’s bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter. They helped offset a 1.2% slide for Apple, which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts’ forecasts. All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.35 points to 5,728.80. The Dow gained 288.73 to 42,052.19, and the Nasdaq composite added 144.77 to 18,239.92. In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher following some swings after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only a net 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month. That was far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September. The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. But the weaker-than-expected jobs report wiped out the slim chance traders had been seeing of the Fed holding rates steady, according to data from CME Group. The Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, as it turns more attention to keeping the job market solid instead of focusing on just driving inflation lower. The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.37%, up from 4.29% late Thursday. Economists said Friday’s jobs report contained a lot of noise and perhaps not much signal. Besides two hurricanes that left destructive paths across the United States during the month, a strike by workers at Boeing also helped depress the numbers. All those distortions make the numbers difficult to parse, “but it doesn’t change our view that the labor market should further decelerate in coming months,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with that expected slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared. A separate report on Friday said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It’s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Fed’s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe after finishing lower across much of Asia outside of Hong Kong. The price of oil, meanwhile, rose again to further trim its loss for the week. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.4%. Brent crude, the international standard, also climbed 0.4%. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Stock market today: Microsoft, Meta and the burden of expectations knock Wall Street sharply lower

Drops for Big Tech companies including Microsoft and Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms led Wall Street lower NEW YORK -- The downside of high expectations thumped Wall Street on Thursday, and Microsoft and Meta Platforms dragged U.S. stock indexes lower despite delivering strong profits for the summer. The S&P 500 sank 1.9% for its worst day in eight weeks and fell further from its record set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 378 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% for a second straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. Microsoft reported bigger profit growth for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped forecasts, but its stock nevertheless sank 6% as investors and analysts scoured for possible disappointments. Many centered on Microsoft’s estimate for upcoming growth in its Azure cloud-computing business, which fell short of some analysts’ expectations. The parent company of Facebook, meanwhile, likewise served up a better-than-expected profit report. As with Microsoft, that wasn’t enough to boost its stock. Investors focused instead on Meta Platforms’ warning that it expects a “significant acceleration” in spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing artificial intelligence. It fell 4.1%. Both Microsoft and Meta Platforms have soared in recent years amid a frenzy around AI, and they’re entrenched among Wall Street’s most influential stocks. But such stellar performances have critics saying their stock prices have simply climbed too fast, leaving them too expensive. It’s difficult to meet everyone’s expectations when they’re so high, and Microsoft and Meta were both among Thursday’s heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Amazon and Apple also helped drag the market lower, with Amazon falling 3.4% and Apple dropping 2% before they released their profit reports after trading ended for the day. They’re the latest companies in the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to do so. Earlier this month, Tesla and Alphabet kicked off the Magnificent Seven’s reports with results that investors found impressive enough to reward with higher stock prices. The lone remaining member, Nvidia, will report its results later this earnings season, and its 4.8% drop was Thursday’s heaviest weight on the market after Microsoft. Expectations are just as high for the chip company after its stock soared over 880% in the last two years. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the last six, even though it set an all-time high during the middle of it. Such a big move might have been overdue following an unusually long and placid run, according to Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. He pointed to how the S&P 500 had failed to move by 1% in a day in either direction, without accounting for rounding, for the longest stretch in nearly three years. Still, Thursday wasn’t a complete washout thanks in part to cruise ships and cigarettes. Norwegian Cruise Line Holding steamed 6.3% higher after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cruise ship operator said it was seeing strong demand from customers across its brands and itineraries, and it raised its profit forecast for the full year of 2024. Altria Group rose 7.8% for another one of the S&P 500’s bigger gains after beating analysts’ profit expectations. Chief Executive Billy Gifford credited resilience for its Marlboro brand, among other things, and announced a cost-cutting initiative. Oil-and-gas companies also rose after the price of a barrel of U.S. crude gained 0.9% to recoup some of its losses for the week and for the year so far. ConocoPhillips jumped 6.4%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 108.22 points to 5,705.45. The Dow dropped 378.08 to 41,736.46, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 512.78 to 18,095.15. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends after ignoring food and energy costs were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields swiveled up and down several times following the reports before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of last month. Yields have been rising following a string of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. Such data bolster hopes that the economy can avoid a recession, particularly now that the Fed is cutting interest rates to support the job market instead of keeping them high to quash high inflation. But the surprising resilience is also forcing traders to downgrade their expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes sank across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.5% for one of the larger losses after North Korea test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to hit the U.S. mainland in a move that was likely meant to grab America’s attention ahead of Election Day. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The Iseq was down by 0.48 per cent on Thursday. It comes as stocks in the UK fell, with investors absorbing the details of the UK budget announced on Wednesday. From a banking perspective, AIB rose 1.37 per cent to €4.89 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Bank of Ireland fell by 0.33 per cent to €8.46. Dalata Hotels rose 1.42 per cent to €4.28. Among the food stocks, Glanbia dropped 2.18 per cent to €15.25 and Kerry Group fell 1.93 per cent to €91.50. Ryanair rose marginally by 0.23 per cent to €17.59. Kingspan dropped by 0.19 per cent to €80.65. From a home builders perspective, Glenveagh rose by 1.27 per cent to €1.60. The UK’s main stock indexes fell to a near three-month low on Thursday as investors scaled back bets of rate cuts from the Bank of England (BoE) following Britain’s new big-spending budget plans, which have revived worries about inflation. The blue-chip FTSE 100 dropped 0.6 per cent, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 fell 1.5 per cent. Both the indexes touched their weakest level since August 8th and looked set for monthly losses. Rate-sensitive homebuilder stocks tumbled about 6 per cent as British short-term borrowing costs jumped. New finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget on Wednesday, saying she needed to spend heavily to repair the country’s public services. Britain’s independent budget forecaster said her plans would boost the size of the world’s sixth-largest economy in the short run but raise inflation too, prompting investors to rein in bets that the BoE will reduce rates rapidly over the next year. Traders still stuck to bets that the central bank will cut rates on November 7th by a quarter of a percentage point. British medical equipment maker Smith and Nephew tumbled 12.5 per cent, falling the most among FTSE 100 components, after it cut its annual underlying revenue growth forecast. Europe’s Stoxx 600 slumped over 1 per cent on Thursday, notching the steepest monthly decline in a year, dragged down by bleak corporate earnings and as investors await more clarity on macroeconomic conditions and the US election outcome. The pan-European main stock index closed 1.2 per cent lower, falling to its lowest level since mid-August, with the retail sector leading an overall market decline with a 4 per cent slide. The Stoxx 600 notched a monthly decline of 3.4 per cent, with the technology and real estate sectors bearing the brunt of a sell-off this month. France’s main Cac 40 index was the top monthly laggard among its regional peers. Some caution also emerged after a higher-than-expected rise in eurozone inflation in October and scope for a further pickup in coming months, bolstering the case for caution in European Central Bank monetary policy easing. This follows a 25 bps interest-rate cut this month. Wall Street tumbled on Thursday, after warnings from Microsoft and Meta Platforms about escalating AI costs curtailed enthusiasm for megacap stocks, which have driven the market rally this year. Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms dropped 4 per cent, while Microsoft fell 5.6 per cent, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also rose, past 4.3 per cent, further pressuring equities. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2 per cent in September, in line with economists’ expectation. However, the core figure was 2.7 per cent year over year, slightly higher than the 2.6 per cent forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected. After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 0.25 per cent reduction in the Fed’s November meeting. Microsoft and Meta both said their capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could impact profitability, even as investors look for quick returns on the billions already poured in.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq leads sell-off after Microsoft, Meta earnings prompt Big Tech slide

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week.

Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a fifth straight week as pre-election volatility continued to rock the bond market. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.72% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, up from 6.54% a week earlier. 15-year mortgage rates also increased to 5.99% from 5.71% a week ago. Read more here. Technology stocks led the overall market declines on Thursday. The S&P 500 Technology Sector (XLK) ETF slid 2.8% by mid-session. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning. Read more here. Stocks accelerated their losses on Thursday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped as much as 2% with technology sliding. Among the biggest laggards, Nvidia (NVDA) sank 4% while Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO) also fell 4%. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Stellantis (STLA) reported third quarter revenue and shipments that missed estimates, though the company said it's making "progress addressing operational issues." The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock. Economic data: Core PCE index, (September); Initial & Continuing jobless claims, (week ending Oct. 26); Employment cost index, (third quarter); Challenger jobs cuts, (October); Personal income & Spending, (September) Earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Conoco Phillips (COP), Estée Lauder (EL), Kellanova (K), Intel (INTC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines(NCLH), Peloton (PTON), Merck (MRK), SiriusXM (SIRI), Comcast (CMCSA); Uber (UBER) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Microsoft stock slides as investors weigh earnings Meta beats, but stock falls on heavy spending plans Peloton names former Apple exec as CEO to steer turnaround 'Shadow campaigns': Microsoft-Google legal feud heats up Merck beats Q3 expectations, but China Gardasil sales lag Tesla chipmaker STMicro trims revenue outlook for 3rd time Gold climbs to record amid US election jitters Starbucks (SBUX) shares are indicating a slightly higher open today despite more details about the dreadful quarter the company preannounced last week. And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on fears of AI spending slowdown

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility ￼
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/10/31/the-philosophy-of-volatility-5/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T16:34:45Z
Full Content:
ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy.

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet yell and talk, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of black rock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼ Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼ Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase micro strategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼ this will be a big deal￼. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 Foolish Way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero; they think that your success means my failure, that you’re a big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use micro strategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling micro strategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto.

Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent micro strategy earnings call, call Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about micro strategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance? Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼ for me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, would even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likes traditional money in capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼ so I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the vitality flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life for that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of Accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should be in guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban The use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, There should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically love you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or I am a passenger. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. So also, all those curious… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all mail, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders, Who Dr., Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the micro strategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about micro strategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, our discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown Kang now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet yell and talk, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of black rock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼ Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼ Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase micro strategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼ this will be a big deal￼. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 Foolish Way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero; they think that your success means my failure, that you’re a big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use micro strategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling micro strategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, Likes to give fellatio to Carl Marx, is a fake woke plant based hippie, spent too much time on Reddit, and pirate Bay, spent too much time quarantine Maria Ozawa pornography, maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and the watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, my own dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities at the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snow piercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spite so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But I’ve done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you producers practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet we’re stores and fails, I called this the life after stoicism, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional on feeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, But when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think we’re adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we tried to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff , we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, four weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife in about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼ anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment an anger is like drinking Poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like your Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and killed other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow Spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent micro strategy earnings call, call Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about micro strategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance? Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼ for me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, would even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money.

Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼ so I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw.

You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of Accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should be in guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban The use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, There should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically love you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or I am a passenger. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. So also, all those curious… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all mail, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders, Who Dr., Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the micro strategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about micro strategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, our discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown Kang now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet yell and talk, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of black rock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼ Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼ Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase micro strategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼ this will be a big deal￼. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 Foolish Way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero; they think that your success means my failure, that you’re a big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use micro strategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling micro strategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, Likes to give fellatio to Carl Marx, is a fake woke plant based hippie, spent too much time on Reddit, and pirate Bay, spent too much time quarantine Maria Ozawa pornography, maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and the watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, my own dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

Title: Meta Platforms stock target cut, sector perform rating on AI spend concerns
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/meta-platforms-stock-target-cut-sector-perform-rating-on-ai-spend-concerns-93CH-3694883
Time Published: 2024-10-31T14:54:56Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, Scotiabank revised its stock price target for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) to $583 from the previous target of $585, while keeping a Sector Perform rating on the stock. The adjustment follows Meta's third-quarter earnings, which met consensus expectations but did not particularly impress, given the stock's 95% rise over the trailing twelve months (TTM). The company's growing infrastructure costs due to artificial intelligence (AI) requirements and a 9% year-over-year increase in headcount were highlighted as potential concerns for future margin growth. Meta's management has indicated significant growth in infrastructure investments continuing into 2025, with substantial capital expenditures anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company's advertising revenue growth has decelerated by approximately 300 basis points compared to the second quarter, facing a tougher year-over-year comparison. Despite the average price per advertisement growing by 11% year-over-year, the number of ad impressions delivered slowed down roughly 300 basis points from the second quarter, with relatively flat comparables. The report also pointed out that Meta expects operating losses in its Reality Labs division to climb substantially year-over-year, owing to ongoing product development initiatives, including Project Orion. As the company elaborates on its product roadmap, these investments are being closely watched. In light of these factors, Scotiabank has slightly lowered its margin expectations for Meta Platforms. Consequently, the price target has been adjusted to $583, which is approximately 24 times the firm's revised fiscal year 2025 earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $24.31, down from the prior estimate of $24.36. The new target reflects the analyst's cautious stance on the company's ability to monetize its AI investments and sustain margin growth amidst increasing expenditures. In other recent news, Meta Platforms has been under the spotlight following a series of analyst ratings and price target revisions. Following the company's third-quarter results, Scotiabank trimmed its price target for the company from $585 to $583, citing concerns about rising infrastructure costs and a 9% year-over-year increase in headcount. On a more positive note, Meta reported a 19% year-over-year increase in revenue totaling $40.6 billion. Meanwhile, investment firms DA Davidson and Citi have raised their price targets for Meta to $700 and $705, respectively, while maintaining their buy ratings. These adjustments come in light of the company's successful integration of generative AI, which has reportedly led to increased user engagement and better ad conversion rates. Stifel kept its price target at $663, maintaining a positive outlook on Meta's performance. In addition to these financial developments, Meta announced a partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand Inc., aiming to leverage AI to improve immersive learning and extended reality applications in corporate settings. These recent developments underline the ongoing efforts and strategic direction of Meta Platforms in the tech industry. Meta Platforms continues to show strong financial performance despite the concerns raised in Scotiabank's analysis. According to InvestingPro data, Meta's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at $149.78 billion, with an impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the same period. This growth aligns with the company's ongoing investments in infrastructure and AI, as mentioned in the article. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and has "liquid assets exceed short term obligations," which could provide a buffer for the increased infrastructure investments and capital expenditures expected in the coming years. Moreover, the company's "impressive gross profit margins" of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 suggest that Meta has room to absorb higher costs while maintaining profitability. While Scotiabank has slightly lowered its margin expectations, it's worth noting that Meta's operating income margin for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 remains robust at 41.21%. This, coupled with the InvestingPro Tip that "9 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period," indicates that there's still confidence in Meta's financial outlook despite the challenges outlined in the article. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips for Meta Platforms, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Barclays reaffirms Overweight on Microsoft stock amid short-term supply concerns
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/barclays-reaffirms-overweight-on-microsoft-stock-amid-shortterm-supply-concerns-93CH-3694812
Time Published: 2024-10-31T14:29:31Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, Barclays reiterated its Overweight rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a steady price target of $475.00. The firm's analysis suggests that Microsoft's stock might not see immediate excitement due to short-term supply issues impacting AI capacity. These issues are expected to lead to stable Azure consumption trends in the second quarter compared to the first, which, while solid, does not act as a new catalyst for investor enthusiasm. The firm anticipates improvements in the second half of the year, but clarity on the magnitude of this re-acceleration will only be available when Microsoft releases its third-quarter fiscal year numbers in April 2025. This leaves little for investors to anticipate in the near term. Despite the promising development of Microsoft's Copilot, its performance metrics are not individually reported since it is part of the broader Office franchise, making it challenging to quantify its specific impact. Barclays points out that while Microsoft's high capital expenditure, approximately $20 billion including leases for the first quarter, is a sign of the company's investment in future growth, the market may seek more tangible results before responding positively. The firm expresses confidence in Microsoft's strategy and maintains its Overweight rating and price target, acknowledging that some investors may require visible evidence of revenue growth to share this optimism. In other recent news, tech giants Microsoft and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have announced increased investments in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, a move that has sparked concerns among investors. Microsoft's capital spending rose 5.3% to $20 billion in the first fiscal quarter, a figure that surpasses its entire annual expenditure up until fiscal 2020. Similarly, Meta signaled a "significant acceleration" in AI-related infrastructure expenses for the next year. These recent developments indicate an industry-wide push towards AI development, as noted by GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle. However, D.A. Davidson's Gil Luria expressed concern about the impact of Microsoft's investment strategy on future margins. In tandem with these developments, Microsoft reported a 16% increase in revenue to $65.6 billion for the fiscal first quarter, exceeding Wall Street projections. This has been attributed to the company's expansion in data center capacity and rising demand for AI technologies. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Cloud segment also experienced a significant revenue increase in the same quarter, indicating a robust demand for AI-enhanced computing services. Jefferies recently reaffirmed its Buy rating on Microsoft, maintaining a steady price target of $550. The firm expects Microsoft's Azure, the company's cloud computing service, to grow around 33% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Despite the industry's capacity constraints, both Microsoft and Meta emphasized the early stage of the AI cycle and highlighted the long-term potential of AI technology. Microsoft's financial metrics and market position offer additional context to Barclays' analysis. According to InvestingPro data, Microsoft boasts a substantial market capitalization of $3.22 trillion, underscoring its position as a tech giant. The company's P/E ratio of 36.65 and PEG ratio of 1.68 suggest that while the stock is trading at a premium, it may still have room for growth relative to its earnings potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's strong financial health and market position. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns. This is particularly noteworthy given Barclays' mention of high capital expenditures, as it shows Microsoft's ability to balance investment in future growth with current shareholder rewards. Moreover, Microsoft's revenue growth of 15.67% over the last twelve months aligns with Barclays' expectation of solid performance, even if it doesn't provide an immediate catalyst for investor excitement. The company's strong return over the last five years, as noted in the InvestingPro Tips, supports the long-term investment case that Barclays seems to be making with its Overweight rating. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Microsoft, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market dynamics.

Title: The Dow falls 250 points and the Nasdaq sinks 340 as Microsoft and Meta lead a tech stock selloff

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 250 points Thursday mid-morning, alongside sharp Nasdaq and S&P 500 declines, following earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT+0.98%) and Meta (META-0.08%), as both tech giants grapple with challenges in meeting the surging demand for AI. Meta stock fell about 3% in Thursday trading, while Microsoft stock dropped more than 5%. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) stock continued to fall following the resignation of Ernst & Young, the company’s auditor, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq Shares of crypto-friendly companies like Coinbase (COIN+2.01%), MicroStrategy (MSTR-6.12%), and Robinhood (HOOD+2.09%) also slipped after releasing their earnings a day earlier. In afternoon trading, the Dow was down 248 points, or 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 421 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%. Positive news on the economic front came in the form of a significant drop in U.S. initial unemployment claims to a five-month low, indicating a resilient labor market. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ending Oct. 26, surpassing economists’ expectations of 230,000 claims. And inflation continues to cool, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — showed a 2.1% year-over-year increase for September, down from 2.3% in August, according to data released Thursday. This inflation slowdown, almost all the way to the Fed’s target of 2% annual inflation, was a hopeful signal for consumers and the Fed alike as it plans to continue cutting interest rates. Investors will be watching Apple (AAPL-1.28%) and Amazon (AMZN+6.19%) earnings after the closing bell. Apple’s (AAPL-1.28%) fourth-quarter report Thursday will be the first glimpse into sales since Apple unveiled its latest slate of iPhones and new artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, at its annual event in early September — and Wall Street is expecting a strong quarter of yearly growth. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $1.60 for Apple’s fourth fiscal quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.05%). Net income is projected to reach $24.24 billion, which would represent more than 5% growth from the same period a year ago. Apple has had a strong year over all. Its shares are up about 25% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 index. Amazon is set to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, after slightly missing expectations in its last quarter. The retail and cloud giant is expected to report revenues of $157.3 billion for the quarter ended in September, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. Amazon is expected to report earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.14. In the last quarter, the company issued lower-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, setting revenue expectations between $154 and $158.5 billion — or between 8% and 11% year over year growth. In the second quarter, Amazon reported revenues of $148 billion — a 10% increase from the previous year, but still below expectations of $148.7 billion, according to FactSet. However, the company reported net income of $13.5 billion in the second quarter, which was above expectations of $11 billion. Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing division, reported $26.3 billion in revenue, which was up 19% year over year. – Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 28: Facebook debuts its new company brand, Meta, at their ... [+] headquarters on October 28, 2021 in Menlo Park, California. Meta will focus on ushering in a future of the metaverse and beyond. (Photo by Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for Facebook) There is something special about CEOs who start and run publicly traded companies. They have the creative spark, drive, and determination to keep placing bets on new growth opportunities. They also have a special mindset — dubbed Cognitive Hunger in my book, Brain Rush — that can produce the kind of expectations-beating growth that propels a company’s stock price to new highs. Sadly, investors can pay a short-term price when those bets do not pay off. This comes to mind in considering the mixed third-quarter report of Meta Platforms — whose founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made such a huge bet on what he called the metaverse — that he changed the company’s name from Facebook. His willingness to place such bets sent Meta’s stock down more than 1% in October 31 pre-market trading. While Meta exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations, investors were not persuaded by the company’s contention that “really big” opportunities justify a “significant acceleration” in spending on AI capital expenditures in 2025, as Zuckerberg told investors in an October 30 earnings call. What’s more, Meta’s user growth in the quarter fell short of expectations. Despite these concerns, here are two reasons this dip could present a buying opportunity: Analysts see the potential for Meta stock to rise over the next year. Meta’s financial performance was mixed in the latest quarter. The good news was stronger-than-expected third-quarter advertising revenue growth. The bad news was a slight shortfall in user growth — as measured by the “number of users who signed into at least one of its apps in a day” — and “significant acceleration” in 2025 infrastructure spending, according to the Associated Press. Here are the key numbers: “We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We also have strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses.” Falling short of user growth expectations puts pressure on Meta to boost revenue per users. The company told investors its AI tools are boosting advertising effectiveness. “The miss in its user metric, daily active people, is concerning, as Meta will need to squeeze more revenue out of its existing users as growth slows,” Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told AP. Meta could accomplish this goal “as its AI-powered tools are boosting engagement by helping show users more of what they like and making its ads, particularly on Reels, more effective,” she added. Meta’s AI-driven feed and video recommendations are helping to boost engagement. More specifically, these tools resulted in an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram, Zuckerberg told investors in the call. Moreover, in the past month “more than one million advertisers used Meta’s generative AI tools to create more than 15 million ads,” he added. Moreover, businesses “using image generation are seeing a 7% increase” in the number of users to make a purchase after viewing the ad, Zuckerberg said. Finally, Meta’s Threads — a rival to Elon Musk’s X — now has 275 million monthly active users, a 50% increase since April 2024. In October the company rolled out Meta AI — its free generative AI tool — which it plans to make “available in 43 countries and a dozen languages,” reported the Journal. These new services could offer the potential for Meta to boost ad revenue. Meta has persuaded some investors of the company’s ability to control expenses. Despite a 9% headcount increase to 72,000 employees over the last year, Zuckerberg has emphasized the company's frequent layoffs aimed at ongoing “efficiency,” noted Fortune. This has resulted in an increase in operating profit. Due to the company’s 13% growth in operating expenses in the third quarter — below the company’s 19% revenue growth — Meta’s operating margin has increased three percentage points to 43% in the last year, Fortune reported. One analyst was impressed with this effort. “They’ve really shown they’ve gotten to a level of expense discipline and AI is actually adding to the bottom line,” Justin DuMouchelle, a portfolio manager at New York-based Cerity Partners, told the Journal. Meta has clearly demonstrated a willingness to place enormous bets on growth opportunities. Zuckerberg’s bet on “the so-called metaverse, a virtual space where he expects people to work and spend time in the future,” the Journal noted, has resulted in $50 billion in losses. In the latest quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs unit — maker the Quest headset and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses — posted $4.4 billion in operating losses. Meta has spent more than expected on capital expenditures — largely for AI. During the earnings call, the company raised to low end of its 2024 capital expenditures guidance by $1 billion to $38 billion — while the high end remained at $40 billion. Meta expects capital expenditures to increase “significantly” in 2025. These investments are justified by the potential returns. “I just think that the opportunities here are really big,” Zuckerberg told investors. “I’m proud of the teams that are doing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity so that way we can deliver world-class models and world-class products,” he added. One analyst expressed a mixed reaction. “Meta is firing on all cylinders and A.I. is clearly driving growth,” Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, told the New York Times. “With that being said, investors appear to be disappointed about the company’s forward guidance and the rising costs needed to develop A.I. features.” Investors see some upside for Meta stock. The average analyst price target of $613.13 per share, according to Barron’s, represents 5% upside. Shares could rise more than that if AI can drive up Meta’s ad revenues more than investors expect.

The S&P 500 was poised to add to Wednesday's declines at the open. Bond yield, which took a pause, were rising again Thursday after the Fed's favorite inflation gauge moved close to the central bankers' 2% target. The headline personal consumption expenditures price index in September was up 2.1% year over year, matching estimates. 2. Weekly jobless claims came in at 216,000. That was fewer than expected. On Wednesday, the ADP's October look at hiring at U.S. companies was much stronger than expected. Traders are trying to see what all that means for the government's monthly employment data Friday. 3. Big Tech earnings will continue to roll in after Thursday's closing bell, with Club names Apple and Amazon leading the way. On Apple, be ready for the single most anticipated worse-than-expected and guided own that I have ever seen. On Amazon, remember it told us that retail was weaker in its previous guide down that took the stock down to $161 per share back in August. The stock closed Wednesday at nearly $193. 4. Microsoft was not getting any credit for an incredibly strong quarter with ridiculously conservative guide. The stock was dropping 3%. We reiterated our 1 rating and $500-per-share price target in Wednesday night's Club commentary. 5. It was a disconnect at Meta Platforms, which we detailed in a Wednesday night earnings analysis. The Club stock was down 1.5% despite one heck of a strong third quarter and a current quarter revenue guide above expectations. Meta detailed a commitment to spend to make its artificial intelligence No. 1 as it should be. 6. Club name Starbucks released quarterly results Wednesday evening that were in-line with last week's preannouncement warning. The news came from new CEO Brian Niccol's commentary on the post-earnings conference call. Niccol's overarching message we wrote about: A bunch of changes, both big and small, are coming to the menu, mobile app, and stores that should satisfy all parties involved. 7. Shares of Nextracker, which has been a tough Club holding, jumped 15% following Wednesday night's better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and guidance raise. We were pleasantly surprised and gratified that this was the best solar earnings we've seen this quarter. Red states and blue states both endorse solar, so it shouldn't be so political. 8. Eaton, which released quarterly results before Thursday's open, beat on earnings and slightly missed on revenue. The Club stock was lower. As of Wednesday's close, shares of the electrical components company were up 42% year to date, roughly double the S&P 500's performance in 2024, on ties to the buildout of data centers for AI. 9. Club stock Linde, as always, went down on the cutting of the company's forecast. Nothing new here. It's what the industrial gases giant has done for the last $200-per-share upside in the stock. Out on Thursday morning, third quarter earnings per share beat but revenue slightly missed. Linde has lagged the S&P 500 year to date. 10. Comcast said Thursday it's exploring the separation of its cable networks business. Shares of Comcast rose more than 6.5% on the news, which came during the company's post-earnings conference call. The third quarter beat on earnings and revenue.

Title: Big Tech's vanishing perks have left employees to face a stark new reality

Boo! Did I scare you? If not, maybe this will surprise you: Microsoft disclosed an equity investment in OpenAI for the first time, SEC filings show. It could hint at an evolution in their relationship, as the tech giant previously described their deal as "a long-term partnership" in filings. In today's big story, Big Tech is pulling back on the freebies for its employees. What's on deck: But first, is this free? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Use it. Don't abuse it. That's the hard lesson tech workers are learning about their jobs' free perks, Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly, Rob Price, Hugh Langley, and Sydney Bradley write. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on the freebies. It's part of a broader push to cut costs across the industry. Those efforts took center stage recently when Meta fired employees for misusing Grubhub credits. Instead of buying food, people used the perk for things like laundry detergent and wine glasses. Employees everywhere have been known to bend the rules with work benefits. A Citibank employee was fired after expensing business trip meals he eventually admitted were for his partner. The difference for tech might be how widespread the perks are. Tech companies have gone out of their way to fully subsidize almost everything for their employees. It's not charity. The perks help recruit and retain talent and keep employees working at the office. (Free lunch at the office means more time spent working there.) A tech giant's pullback on one work perk is causing an uproar. Amazon's new return-to-office mandate, which requires employees in the office five days a week, continues to face pushback from its workforce. More than 500 employees signed a letter sent to Amazon Web Services' CEO Matt Garman criticizing his support of the policy, BI's Jyoti Mann and Ashley Stewart write. While speaking at an all-hands earlier this month, Garman said nine out of 10 Amazonians he spoke to were "actually quite excited about this change." Remote work made it harder to innovate and collaborate, he added. Some Amazon employees aren't buying it. In the letter to Garman, they said the lack of hard numbers backing up the decision "fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues." The true benefits and downsides of remote work are hard to nail down. Some studies have shown workers are more productive when working from home. Another conducted last year found remote work can stifle innovation. It's not all bad news for Amazon employees, though. When contacted by BI about the letter, a company spokesperson said in some cases Amazon would offer resources to employees like elder care and pet sitters. In other words, perks.

Title: Meta Warns of Worsening AI Losses After Sales Narrowly Beat

Photo Credit: Reuters Meta recently unveiled an AI model that can check the work of other models Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will ramp up heavy investments in AI and other futuristic technologies, continuing a years-long tug-of-war between the company's long-term bets and the core advertising business that provides the vast majority of Meta's revenue. Zuckerberg warned investors Wednesday that Meta will continue to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses, efforts he believes are core to the company's future. That will be supported by the ads business, which isn't generating the kind of momentum Wall Street expected. Shares fell more than 2.8% in extended trading. “We're seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work, from our core businesses to new services and computing platforms,” the Meta chief executive officer said during its third quarter earnings call. “There are lots of opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business.” Meta cautioned that losses from Reality Labs, its division focused on artificial intelligence and augmented reality, will continue to widen “meaningfully” this year, adding that the 2025 budget is still being finalized. Reality Labs reported a $4.4 billion operating loss in the quarter. With costs projected to reach nearly $100 billion this year, Meta is putting pressure on its core advertising business to fund the effort. Meta told investors Wednesday that revenue for the current quarter would be between $45 billion and $48 billion. Analysts were expecting fourth-quarter revenue of $46 billion. Zuckerberg has worked to re-frame the social media company as an AI innovator in recent years, changing investor perception of Meta's potential growth. Meta has developed several key AI products as part of that pivot, including large language models used to power chatbots, an assistant built into its various social apps, and AI-powered smart glasses. Meta is already working on the next version of Llama, the large language model that powers its AI products and services, and Zuckerberg said Llama 4 will be faster, more powerful and more cost-effective than previous models. Some of Zuckerberg's most ambitious projects, though, are still years away from mainstream consumption. Eventually Zuckerberg hopes that users will work and play inside of a digital universe known as the metaverse, which Meta is still building out. The company also recently unveiled its first pair of augmented reality glasses, which can project images onto the physical world. Zuckerberg hopes that those glasses, called Orion, may one day rival the smartphone. That focus on AI has helped fuel Meta's stock price, which was up more than 67% this year at market close Wednesday, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. But it has also come with a steep cost. “Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure and I expect to continue investing significantly there,” Zuckerberg said. Meanwhile, Meta's social networks, including Facebook and Instagram, continue to drive the bulk of the business. Meta reported sales of $40.6 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, a jump of 19% over the prior-year quarter, and just above the $40.3 billion average estimate from Wall Street analysts. Meta has leaned on AI advancements to improve its ad targeting and content recommendations, which have had a more immediate impact on business results. The company has pivoted its algorithms to show people more content from outside their network of friends and family, part of a broader strategy to increase engagement and keep people scrolling. It's also been reducing the spread of political content. AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. Those recommendations are largely powered by AI advancements, which help the company more accurately predict what people want to see. Meta said its expenses for the year will be $96 billion to $98 billion, lowering the top end of that range by $1 billion. © 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Microsoft, Meta report; Samsung's chip unit disappoints - what's moving markets

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower as traders gauge quarterly reports from major technology groups. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) post higher-than-expected revenue and net profit, but worries persisted around the impact of their heavy expenditures on artificial intelligence. Elsewhere, Samsung Electronics's (KS:005930) chip unit logs quarterly operating income that missed projections, although the memory-chip provider said it was making "meaningful progress" in securing a major supply deal. 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Thursday as investors digested earnings from big-name technology companies and assessed a raft of economic data. By 04:31 ET (08:31 GMT), the Dow futures contract had fallen by 209 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had slipped by 47 points or 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had shed 225 points or 1.1%. The main averages ended the prior session in the red, with markets looking ahead to key returns from software giant Microsoft and Instagram-parent Meta Platforms (more below). Shares in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the first of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" group of megacap tech stocks to report this week, rose on the Google-owner's better-than-anticipated third-quarter revenue and income. However, equities were weighed down by disappointing outlooks from chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and wireless products maker Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO). Server manufacturer Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) slumped by more than 30% after it announced that EY has resigned as its auditor, denting the stock price of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Super Micro, which packages GPU chips made by Nvidia into server systems, has hugely benefited from its relationship with artificial intelligence semiconductor titan. On the data front, markets were pouring through an advance estimate of third-quarter US gross domestic product that was below expectations and hotter-than-projected private payrolls growth. The numbers, along with a key nonfarm payrolls report later this week, are the last economic readings before the all-important -- and extremely close -- Nov. 5 presidential election. 2. Microsoft unveils soft guidance Shares in Microsoft sank in premarket US trading after the company's executives warned that revenues at its crucial Azure cloud computing unit were softening in the current quarter. The statement erased earlier gains in the stock. Investors were initially cheered by a 16% uptick in fiscal first-quarter revenues from the year-ago period to $65.6 billion, which topped Wall Street forecasts of $64.5 billion. Net income of $24.7 billion beat expectations as well. Undergirding the returns was quarterly revenue from Azure and its other cloud services, which gained by 33% from the previous year, although Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood flagged the segment's growth would slow to between 31% to 32% in its second quarter. Microsoft added that its capital expenses would expand because of ongoing investments into building out its AI capabilities. The company has turned itself into one of the foremost figures of the boom in the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, thanks in particular to Azure's success and a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. 3. Meta's AI bets in focus Elevated AI expenditures were also in focus at Meta Platforms, with the Facebook-owner's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg saying the spending was showing "strong momentum." Meta especially highlighted an anticipated "significant" surge in capital investments in 2025 mostly due to the cash needed to run its AI infrastructure. Meta has been banking on AI as a tool to enhance its offerings and satisfy wary stakeholders following a lossmaking gamble by Zuckerberg on an avatar-filled metaverse. However, the pressure from investors remains high on not just Meta but also its megacap tech rivals. Concerns are beginning to rise around the timeline for the pay outs from these groups' massive AI bets as well as the impact the spending could have on recently fat margins. Shares in Meta dipped in premarket trading even though the firm unveiled higher-than-anticipated revenues of $40.6 billion and net profit of $15.7 billion. Attention now turns to e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which are scheduled to post their latest results after the closing bell on Thursday. Like their Big Tech peers, the outlook for AI investments will likely play a major role in these reports. 4. Samsung Electronics chip unit income misses estimates Operating profit at top memory-chip manufacturer Samsung Electronics's crucial semiconductor division slipped by 40% versus the prior quarter in the July to September period to 3.9 trillion won, missing estimates and falling short of rival SK Hynix. Samsung said the unit's profits were hit by one-off expenses, including the provision of employee incentives and foreign exchange headwinds related to a weaker US dollar. The numbers come after Samsung publicly apologized for disappointing returns from the chip business, which has grappled with stiff competition from SK Hynix in delivering the high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips utilized in AI hardware. However, Seoul-listed shares in Samsung eked out a marginal gain on Thursday after the company vowed to focus on producing the high-end processors and revealed it was making "meaningful progress" in winning approval from a "major customer." Sales of its HBM chips are seen rising in the fourth quarter. 5. Crude choppy Oil prices were choppy on Thursday after an unexpected draw in US inventories pointed to strength of demand in the world’s largest crude consumer. By 04:30 ET, the Brent contract dipped 0.4% to $71.91 per barrel, while US crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% lower at $68.39 a barrel. Both contracts rose more than 2% on Wednesday, after falling more than 6% earlier in the week on the reduced risk of a wider Middle East conflict. US gasoline stockpiles fell unexpectedly in the week ending Oct. 25 to a two-year low, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, while crude inventories also posted a surprise fall.

Title: European stocks weaken ahead of key eurozone CPI release; Shell details buybacks

Investing.com - European stock markets fell Thursday, as investors digested more corporate quarterly results as well as the latest eurozone inflation release. At 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 1.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.4% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. dropped 1%. Eurozone inflation accelerated more than expected in October, rising to 2.0% on an annual basis, from 1.7% in September, above expectations for a 1.9% rise. A more closely watched figure which strips out volatile food and energy prices meanwhile held steady at 2.7%, above forecasts for 2.6%, Eurostat said on Thursday. The ECB has cut interest rates three times this year, with the latest cut at its last meeting in October, the first back-to-back cut since the euro crisis in 2011. It is expected to ease monetary policy once more when it next meets, but these figures could bolstering the case for caution as price growth is not yet fully tamed. ECB President Christine Lagarde said that this inflation rate will durably reach its 2.0% target in the course of 2025, in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde. "Maybe we could have started to intervene a few months earlier. But we raised rates at an unprecedented rate, and we managed to bring inflation down significantly over a short period," Lagarde said on Thursday. "Now I want to see that 2% target achieved on a lasting basis. In the absence of a major shock, this will be the case in the course of 2025." Turning to the corporate sector, there are more quarterly earnings from a number of major companies for investors to study. Shell (LON:SHEL) stock rose 3% after Europe’s largest oil and gas company reported third-quarter profit of $6 billion, exceeding forecasts, and announced another $3.5 billion of share buybacks. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) stock fell over 5% after the French bank, the eurozone’s largest lender, needed increased trading activity at its investment banking division to meet quarterly profit expectations as lending headwinds remained. Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) stock rose 2.2% after the car giant stated that it was moving quickly to cut US inventories, even as quarterly revenues fell by 27%. AB Inbev (EBR:ABI) stock dropped over 6% after the brewing giant posted a drop in third-quarter volumes, after a drop in sales in Asia Pacific, although a share buyback and lifted guidance has helped. Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) stock fell over 12% after the UK-based medical equipment manufacturer slashed its full-year revenue guidance, citing weakness in the important Chinese market. Across the pond, both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) topped profit and revenue expectations for the July-September period, but the tech giants also pointed to increased spending to build out AI data centers in a rush to meet vast demand. Oil prices edged higher Thursday, adding to the previous session’s gains, after an unexpected draw in U.S. inventories pointed to strength of demand in the US, the world’s largest consumer. By 11:00 ET, the Brent contract climbed 1.2% to $73.03 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1.3% higher at $69.52 per barrel. Both contracts rose more than 2% on Wednesday, after falling more than 6% earlier in the week on the reduced risk of a wider Middle East conflict. U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell unexpectedly in the week ending Oct. 25 to a two-year low, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, while crude inventories also posted a surprise fall.

Title: Meta, Microsoft lift AI spending, worrying Wall Street ahead of Amazon results

Big tech including Microsoft and Meta are stepping up spending to build out AI data centres in a rush to meet vast demand, but Wall Street is hungry for a quicker payday on the billions invested. Microsoft and Meta both said on Wednesday their capital expenses were growing due to their AI investments. Alphabet, too, reported on Tuesday that these expenditures would remain elevated. Amazon, which is set to report results on Thursday, is likely to echo these forecasts. The extensive capital spending could threaten fat margins at these companies, and pressure on this metric is likely to spook investors. Big tech shares fell in after-hours trading on Wednesday, highlighting the challenges the companies face as they seek to balance ambitious AI pursuits with the need to reassure investors they are focused on short-term results. Meta’s stock fell 2.9 per cent in after-hours trading, and Microsoft’s stock price fell 3.6 per cent, despite each topping profit and revenue expectations for the July-September period. Amazon stock also dipped. "It's costly to run AI technology. Getting capacity is expensive," said GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle. "It has become a competitive race among the big tech companies to build out capacity. It's going to take time to see the returns, to see widespread adoption of the technology." Microsoft's capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020, according to Visible Alpha. For Meta, a quarter's worth of spending is in line with what they spent in a year until 2017. Microsoft said capital spending rose 5.3 per cent to $20 billion in its first fiscal quarter, and predicted increased spending on AI in the second. But growth at its key cloud business Azure is likely to slow, it warned, blaming capacity constraints at its data centres. "I think what investors are missing is that for every year Microsoft overinvests - like they have this year - they're creating a whole percentage point of drag on margins for the next six years," said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Meta, meanwhile, warned of “significant acceleration” in artificial intelligence-related infrastructure expenses next year.Capacity constraints are rippling through the tech industry. Chipmakers including powerhouse Nvidia are struggling to keep up, in turn making it harder for cloud companies to build out capacity. Advanced Micro Devices, which reported results earlier this week, said demand for AI chips was rising much faster than supply, limiting its ability to tap the order surge.

By Anna Tong, Aditya Soni and Deborah Mary Sophia (Reuters) -Big technology companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are stepping up spending to build out AI data centers in a rush to meet vast demand, but Wall Street is hungry for a quicker payday on the billions invested. Microsoft and Meta both said on Wednesday their capital expenses were growing due to their AI investments. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), too, reported on Tuesday that these expenditures would remain elevated, while Amazon said they would increase the rest of the year and into 2025. The extensive capital spending could threaten fat margins at these companies and pressure on profitability is likely to spook investors. Big Tech shares fell on Thursday, highlighting the challenges the companies face as they seek to balance ambitious AI pursuits with the need to reassure investors they are focused on short-term results. Shares of Meta slipped 4% and Microsoft fell 6%, despite each topping profit and revenue expectations for the July-September period. Amazon fell 3.4% but investors sent the shares up aftermarket on better-than-expected third quarter results. "It's costly to run AI technology. Getting capacity is expensive," said GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle. "It has become a competitive race among the big tech companies to build out capacity. It's going to take time to see the returns, to see widespread adoption of the technology." Amazon on Thursday said it expected higher capital expenditures for the foreseeable future to help serve the development of AI software. CEO Andy Jassy in a call with analysts called AI a "maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity." The Seattle company's capital expenditure is expected to be around $75 billion this year compared with $48.4 billion last year and that number will be even higher in 2025. Microsoft's capital spending for a single quarter now is more than its annual expenditure used to be until fiscal 2020, according to Visible Alpha. For Meta, a quarter's worth of spending is in line with what it spent in a year until 2017. Microsoft said capital spending rose 5.3% to $20 billion in its first fiscal quarter and predicted increased spending on AI in the second. But growth at its key cloud business Azure is likely to slow, it warned, blaming capacity constraints at its data centers. "I think what investors are missing is that for every year Microsoft overinvests - like they have this year - they're creating a whole percentage point of drag on margins for the next six years," said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Meta, meanwhile, warned of "significant acceleration" in artificial intelligence-related infrastructure expenses next year. BOTTLENECKS IMPEDE GROWTH Capacity constraints are rippling through the tech industry. Chipmakers including AI powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are struggling to keep up, in turn making it harder for cloud companies to build out capacity. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which reported results earlier this week, said demand for AI chips was rising much faster than supply, limiting its ability to tap the order surge. It warned that supply of AI chips would be tight going into next year. Despite the concerns, Meta and Microsoft said it was still very early in the AI cycle and emphasized the long-term potential of the technology. The investments are reminiscent of when Big Tech was developing cloud businesses and waiting for customers to embrace the technology. "Building out the infrastructure is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, but I think the opportunities here are really big," said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during Wednesday's earning call. "We're going to continue investing significantly in this."

Title: Meta’s Zuckerberg Touts AI Progress but Warns of ‘Serious Infrastructure’

The old saying is you’ve got to spend money to make money. For Meta, notching a third quarter earnings report with record revenues, the fact remains that the long-term artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap will require as yet undefined billions of dollars of capital investments in the next year and beyond. The read across might be that margins would feel a pinch, and investors sent the shares 3% lower in after-hours trading on Wednesday (Oct. 30). The record came in the form of roughly $40.6 billion in sales, up 19% from a year ago. As for the core businesses: Earnings supplementals noted that total advertising-related revenues came in at $39.9 billion, compared to $33.6 billion last year. Ad impressions delivered 7% growth year over year, where those growth rates had been as high as 21% a year ago, worldwide. The average price per ad was 11%, up slightly from the 10% in the second quarter. The firm reported a daily active user count of about 3.29 billion, up 5%. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the conference call with analysts that pushing ahead with AI will be tied to “serious infrastructure.” That infrastructure will demand that the company “continue investing significantly” against a backdrop where the executive also said that the firm had not decided on a “final budget” yet. 2025 looms as a year where Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li said on the call that 2024 capex will be around $38 billion to $40 billion, tightening the bottom end of the range. The forward guidance of $45 billion to $48 billion for the fourth quarter sales implies roughly 12% to 19% growth from the year ago period. It must be noted that Meta’s stock has surged by double digits through the past year, and AI has been a focus on earnings calls and presentations. That narrative continued on Wednesday night: Zuckerberg said that “parts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing [are] coming into sharper focus. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day, and we’re seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard across the industry.” He noted that Threads has evolved into a community with 275 million monthly active users — growing by more than 1 million signups daily. “We are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we’re seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work — from our core business engagement and monetization to our long-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms,” Zuckerberg said. Meta AI has more than 500 million monthly active users, he said. Improvements to AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone, said Zuckerberg, who added “more than a million advertisers used our GenAI tools to create more than 15 millions ads in the last month. And we estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a 7% increase in conversions. … We believe that there’s a lot more upside here. “Llama token usage has grown exponentially,” he said. The Llama 3 models, he said, represent an “inflection point” in the industry, but Llama 4 is “well into development.” The company continues to lose money on its Reality Labs segment — home to virtual reality and augmented reality efforts — where revenues of $270 million were higher than $210 million a year ago, but the operating loss increased to $4.4 billion, up from $3.7 billion last year. Zuckerberg said on the call that its Ray-Ban glasses have been doing well, and now have a Meta AI integration that helps users with suggestions as they are using the product — which he termed as “the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you. Demand for the glasses continues to be very strong.” CFO Li said that within ad revenues, “The online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by health care and entertainment and media. … On Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction. And we’re making ongoing progress with our focus on promoting original content, with more than 60% of recommendations now coming from original posts in the U.S.” Li pointed to the use of advanced models to monetize and enhance marketing performance. “Similar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads performance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling. For example, we recently deployed new learning and modeling techniques that enable our ad systems to consider the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. Previously, our ad system could only aggregate those actions together, without mapping the sequence.” The company has seen as much as a 2% to 4% increase in conversions based on testing within selected segments, Li said. “For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year over year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem,” she said. Zuckerberg emphasized the ways in which AI will be harnessed in the service of everything from daily task management to content creation. “In the next year, our goal around that is going to be to try to make these pretty widespread use cases, even though there’s going to be a multiyear path to getting the kind of the depth of usage and the business results that we want.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The S&P 500 tumbled 1.86% to finish at 5,705.45. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.76% to close at 18,095.15. Both indexes posted their biggest one-day declines since Sept. 3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 378.08 points, or 0.9%, to end at 41,763.46. Microsoft shares slid 6% after the tech giant's revenue guidance disappointed investors and overshadowed a quarterly earnings beat. Meta Platforms dropped more than 4% after the Facebook parent missed the Street's expectations for user growth and warned that capital expenditures will significantly rise in 2025. "I think we're getting to the point where AI enthusiasm and potential is not enough. These companies, while they're still levered to those themes and hold favorable long term growth profiles, are not quite delivering the growth that is priced into them," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management. Big tech earnings so far this week have been a mixed bag. While Alphabet shares rose nearly 3% on Wednesday after the company reported strong revenue growth, chipmaker AMD fell more than 10% as investors were disappointed by the company's guidance for the fourth quarter. Tech earnings continue on Thursday with results from megacap stocks Apple and Amazon due after the bell. The latest personal consumption expenditures price index showed 12-month inflation rose at a rate of 2.1% in September, arriving inline with estimates and moving closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The PCE reading is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Thursday's PCE reading, along with Friday's October payrolls report and unemployment data, will inform the Fed's interest rate decision on Nov. 7 when it ends its two-day policy meeting. The major averages are on track to end the week in the red. The Dow has dropped 0.8% week to date, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Thursday was also the final trading day of what has been a choppy month for the market amid heightened uncertainty ahead of the U.S. Presidential election on Nov. 5. The 30-stock Dow lost 1.3% in October. The broad market index shed 1% in that time, while the Nasdaq declined 0.5%. Correction: An earlier version misstated a move in Alphabet shares. U.S. stocks finished Thursday's trading session in the red. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declined 1.86% and 2.76%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 378.08 points, or 0.9%. — Hakyung Kim U.S. crude oil futures closed nearly 1% higher on Thursday, as OPEC+ could delay its planned output boost and gasoline demand picked up in the U.S. U.S. crude oil gained 65 cents, or 0.95%, to settle at $69.26 per barrel, while Brent futures rose by 61 cents, or 0.84%, to close at $73.16 a barrel. Sources told Reuters that OPEC+ could delay its output hike planned for December by a month or more. The prospect of higher supplies next year has weighed on prices recently. U.S. gasoline inventories also fell by 2.7 million barrels last week, signaling an uptick in demand. Oil prices are down more than 3% this week after selling off steeply Monday in the wake of Israel's retaliatory strikes against Iran. Israel spared the Islamic Republic's oil facilities, providing some relief for an oil market that had been on edge over the risk of a supply disruption. — Spencer Kimball Newport News, Virginia-based Huntington Ingalls Industries, the country's largest military shipbuilder, slid as much as 25% Thursday to $187.36, on pace for its worst-ever one-day decline, according to FactSet data. The cause of the slump: Huntington's latest financial numbers. Third quarter earnings of $2.56 per share were far short of the Street's consensus estimate ($3.85), and missed even the most pessimistic of 12 analysts' forecast ($3.69). Revenue of $2.75 billion similarly trailed the average estimate of $2.87 billion and the most bearish individual forecast of $2.81 billion. CEO Chris Kastner blamed "uncertain timing and structure" of anticipated awards from the Navy of contracts to build Virginia-class Block V and Block VI and Columbia-class submarines in the second half. Huntington also blamed an inability to boost manufacturing performance and reduce risk, "due to late critical material deliveries from the supply chain and reduced experience levels within our teams, both in production touch labor and supervision. This leads to labor inefficiency, and in some cases to rework, which can affect program schedules." Huntington began trading as a separate entity after being spun off from Northrop Grumman in 2011. — Scott Schnipper Despite variables and the potential for short-term hiccups, Piper Sandler still see reason to be optimistic about the market in the long run. "Given the uncertainties surrounding the upcoming U.S. Presidential election and Q3 earnings season, we should anticipate near-term pullbacks or modest profit-taking in some extended equities," chief market technician Craig Johnson wrote to clients. "However, the overall technical evidence remains constructive, and the primary trend of the major averages is higher." Johnson reiterated his target for the S&P 500 of 6,100 at the end of 2024. That implies the broad index can rise nearly 5% from where it finished Tuesday. He also expects the index to reach 6,600 at the end of 2025, meaning he foresees a positive year for the broad market. — Alex Harring Coinbase shares were under pressure Thursday, a day after the company reported weaker-than-expected earnings and gave a tepid revenue outlook for the current quarter. The broader market decline also pressured Coinbase. The stock lost 12%, putting it on pace for its biggest drop since March 2023, when it fell 14%. Other crypto-related stocks fell as well. Robinhood, which also reported weak earnings Wednesday, tumbled 15%. Miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms slid 9% and 12%, respectively. Bitcoin, which is often a big influence on the price of Coinbase, slid 2% after hovering below its all-time high this week. Read our full story on the move here. — Tanaya Macheel Some major Wall Street firms are eyeing semiconductor manufacturer KLA Corp after the company beat earnings and revenue estimates on Wednesday. Oppenheimer analyst Edward Yang upgraded KLA to outperform and raised his 12-18 month price target by $100 to $850, which suggests nearly 22.9% potential upside. The company's one of the top five wafer fab equipment companies that comprises 80% of total industry revenue, he pointed out. "KLA is a critical "picks-and-shovels" play that addresses NVDA/AI's most pressing bottlenecks," Yang said in Wednesday note to clients. "AI compute demand doubles every six months, but hardware performance only every two years. This leads to a severe, structural shortage of advanced semiconductors and the tools needed to manufacture them." KLA's down 20% from its all-time high, making it an attractive entry point for investors to buy the stock, according to Yang. Its shares are up 13.9% year to date, but have plummeted about 14.5% this quarter. Bank of America also reiterated its buy rating on KLA on Wednesday, calling it a high-quality compounder and top semicap pick. Citi Research said it views KLA as the "best place to hide" among semi equipment peers. "The necessity for its systems has made KLAC's business less cyclical and more profitable that its peers, resulting in more stable FCF and shareholder returns," Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said. — Pia Singh Peloton shares surged 29% Thursday, headed for its best day since Aug. 22 after the company posted better-than-expected fiscal first quarter earnings. Peloton also announced Ford executive Peter Stern would be its next CEO. The company is back to generating free cash flow and edging within reach of profitability with a breakeven earnings per share report. Shares have rallied over 170% since former CEO Barry McCarthy announced his departure in May and the company shifted away from growth at all costs to focus instead on profitability. — Brandon Gomez, Hakyung Kim Gold futures pulled back roughly 2% on Thursday and headed for their worst day since July. Spot gold also pulled back 2% and headed for its first losing session in five. For the month, bullion has advanced about 5%. — Brian Evans, Nick Wells Nvidia's decline on Thursday stands against the idea that AI-related spending for companies like Meta Platforms is what is weighing on tech stocks, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "There's some skepticism moving into Nvidia here simply because of the broader tech sector moving lower, despite the fact that cap-ex for the rest of the tech sector really benefits Nvidia, as we all know. So that's an interesting kind of square inside of a circle," Stucky said. The Big Tech names were already well owned by active managers, so some investors may just be taking the solid, but not great, earnings season as a chance to recalibrate, Stucky said. "This is just a digestion of positioning, in my mind," he added. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4% in afternoon trading. — Jesse Pound These are the stocks moving the most in midday trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han The financials sector is up 3.3% in October, making it the best-performing sector in the S&P 500. Raymond James is the top outperformer, jumping 21.6% month to date. Wells Fargo has jumped 15.5%, while Morgan Stanley has rallied around 12% in the period. The only other sectors in the green are communication services and energy, which have risen 2.2% and 0.6%, respectively. — Hakyung Kim The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) slumped more than 3% on Thursday as chip stocks suffered. Monolithic Power Systems was a notable loser in the ETF, plummeting about 17% and heading for its worst day since March 2020. Shares are tumbling after the company issued its third-quarter results, wherein it beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, per FactSet. However, revenue from enterprise data fell short of the Street's expectations. SOXX holding Universal Display lost more than 8% after the company trimmed its full-year guidance on revenue and management warned that the rate of growth this year is expected to be "more modest than previously projected." Chipmaker and SOXX member Arm Holdings also dropped more than 8%. —Darla Mercado, Gina Francolla Stocks are under pressure on Thursday after a big round of earnings and economic data, but the trend for both of those areas point to further upside for equities, according to UBS. Solita Marcelli, the CIO for the Americas for UBS global wealth management, said in a note to clients that the earnings reports for Big Tech stocks point to further strength of the AI trend. "The continued growth in AI-related capex reported by all three tech giants supports the positive structural trend. We see the best opportunities in AI-linked semiconductors and US megacaps," the note said, referring to Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. "The combination of solid growth and Fed rate cuts provides a supportive backdrop for risk assets, in our view, while the AI trend should lend further fundamental support to equities," Marcelli continued. UBS projects that the S&P 500 will reach 6,600 by the end of 2025, or up about 15% from here. — Jesse Pound BTIG's chief market technician is forecasting tough days ahead for the broader market. "The QQQs are down ~2%. While the day to day path is difficult to predict, we continue to see downside risk broadly over the coming weeks," Krinsky, the firm's chief market technician, wrote in a Thursday note. Wednesday's trading session tied the longest stretch without a 1% daily S&P 500 move in nearly three years, Krinsky added, noting that the S&P 500 has broken its uptrend from August lows. He said a year-end target of between 5,500 and 5,650 is a reasonable objective for the broad-market index. — Pia Singh Microsoft's 5.9% decline led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower on Thursday. Amazon and Merck were the following biggest underperformers of the index, falling 2.9% each. Only 12 stocks in the Dow were positive on the day. — Hakyung Kim The semiconductor sector broadly fell on Thursday. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF declined 2.9%. Shares of chipmaking giant Nvidia dropped more than 3%. Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer continued their pullbacks from Wednesday and fell 2.6% and 14.3%, respectively. — Hakyung Kim U.S. stocks began Thursday's session in the red. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 220 points, or 0.5%. — Hakyung Kim NBCUniversal parent Comcast is considering a separation of its cable networks business. Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said during Thursday's earnings call that the company is looking into forming "a new, well-capitalized company owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks." Shares of the stock jumped nearly 7% before the bell on Thursday after earnings beat Wall Street expectations. The stock has lost more than 3% in 2024. — Alex Harring, Lillian Rizzo Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC. Some stocks are making big moves before the bell: Read here for the full list. — Sean Conlon The personal consumption expenditures index — a closely watched inflation gauge by the Federal Reserve — rose 0.2% in September and 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. The data was in-line with estimates from economists polled by Dow Jones. The core figure, which excludes energy and food, rose 0.3% on a month over month basis. On a yearly basis, the figure came in at 2.7% and slightly ahead of the 2.6% expected by Dow jones. Elsewhere, weekly jobless claims data for the week ending Oct. 26 came in at 216,000, behind a 230,000 estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. — Samantha Subin Announced layoffs in October rose 51% from a year ago, bringing the 2024 total to its highest level since the Covid-scarred 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Companies listed 55,597 job cuts for the month, which actually showed a 23.7% decline from September, Challenger reported Thursday. The total, though, is 51% higher than October 2023. When looked at on a year-to-date basis, layoffs are up 3.7% in 2024 to 664,839. That's the highest since 2020, and excluding the pandemic is the most since 2009. The bulk of the October cuts came from aerospace and defense and were specifically related to the Boeing strike, the report said. —Jeff Cox The Federal Reserve will get its last look at a key inflation gauge Thursday morning when the Commerce Department releases its monthly reading on the personal consumption expenditures price index. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that headline PCE increased 0.2% in September and 2.1% from a year ago. Excluding food and energy, core PCE is expected to show 0.3% and 2.6% increases, respectively. The Fed uses the PCE as a baseline for monetary policy. Along with the inflation report, there also will be releases on weekly unemployment claims as well as the employment cost index. —Jeff Cox Shares of Uber declined around 6% Thursday before the bell following the company's quarterly earnings announcement. Although the company beat consensus estimates for third-quarter revenue, it missed on forecasts for gross bookings. Uber reported $40.97 billion in gross bookings last quarter, while analysts surveyed by StreetAccount had projected $41.25 billion. — Hakyung Kim European markets opened lower on Thursday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index down 0.65% at 8:04 a.m. London time. Sectors widely traded in negative territory, with insurance stocks falling 1.42% and retail shares pulling back 1.14%. — Sophie Kiderlin Check out some of the companies making headlines in extended trading: Microsoft — The technology giant slid nearly 4% after its revenue guidance for the fiscal second quarter disappointed investors. Microsoft's outlook called for revenue to range between $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG sought $69.83 billion. Booking Holdings — Shares of the online reservation company jumped almost 6%. In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $83.39 per share and revenue of $7.99 billion, while analysts surveyed by LSEG expected $77.52 in earnings per share and $7.63 billion in revenue. Starbucks — Shares ticked nearly 1% lower. The coffee chain said its global same-store sales dropped 7% in the fiscal fourth quarter, as demand in the U.S. and China sagged. Results in the period disappointed, with earnings coming in at 80 cents per share on revenue of $9.07 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $1.03 per share in earnings and $9.36 billion in revenue.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said Meta enjoyed strong momentum in the company’s chatbot and the adoption of its open large language model Llama. Photo / Mike Kai Chen, the New York Times Microsoft’s quarterly revenue rose 16%, driven by demand for cloud computing amid a boom in adoption of artificial intelligence tools. Revenue for its fiscal first quarter was $65.6 billion (NZ$109.78b), beating analysts’ expectations for $64.5b, according to a filing on Wednesday, US time. Net income increased 11% to $24.7b in the three months through to the end of September, exceeding the average estimate of $23.1b. “AI-driven transformation is changing work ... across every role, function and business process,” said chief executive Satya Nadella. He said the company was “winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms”. Sales at Microsoft’s closely watched cloud division, its biggest revenue driver that includes its Azure cloud computing platform, also beat forecasts, climbing 22% from a year ago to $38.9b. Microsoft has been one of the main beneficiaries of the mainstream adoption of AI, with surging demand for its Azure data centres and enthusiasm about its partnership with market leader OpenAI propelling it to become the world’s third-most valuable public company. Its shares, which are up about 16% year to date, rose 0.8% in after-hours trading. At $3.3 trillion, Microsoft’s valuation trails only those of Apple and Nvidia. Rival Google’s stock price rose 4% after it posted similarly strong growth in its cloud business on Tuesday. Meta cited “strong momentum” in its numerous bets on artificial intelligence as quarterly revenue and earnings topped Wall Street expectations, and said spending on the technology will continue to accelerate into 2025. Revenues in the third quarter increased 19% to $40.6b, at the top end of its guide range and a whisker above Wall Street estimates of $40.3b. Net income jumped 35% to $15.7b, well above consensus of a rise to $13.6b. Meta shares, which are up more than 70% in 2024, were down about 3% after the results were released. “We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,” chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said, pointing to “strong momentum” in Meta AI, the company’s chatbot and the adoption of its open large language model Llama by businesses and developers. He also pointed to recent excitement around its AI-powered glasses, part of a partnership with Ray-Ban eyewear. The company said it anticipated fourth-quarter sales in the range of $45b-$48b. The consensus estimate was $46.2b, according to S&P Capital IQ. Meta also raised the bottom of its range for full-year 2024 capital expenditure guidance from $37b-$40b to $38b-$40b. It added that it expected a “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth” next year due to the “higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet”. Shares of Alphabet, the first of the five “Magnificent Seven” megacap stocks that reported results this week, rose 2.8% after the company on Tuesday beat expectations for third-quarter revenue and profit. Alphabet helped to offset falling chip stocks, weighed by dour forecasts from Advanced Micro Devices and Qorvo , which fell 10.6% and 27.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, shares of Super Micro Computer plunged 32.6% after Ernst & Young resigned as the company’s accountant. Nvidia slipped 1.4%. Written by: Stephen Morris and Hannah Murphy in San Francisco.

Title: Meta Posts Record $15.7 Billion Profit as Net Income Balloons 35% in Q3

Time Published: 2024-10-30T20:37:15Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the Facebook parent company will continue to invest in AI and virtual reality because the upside is “really big” Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, reported a record quarterly profit on Wednesday afternoon, as well as stronger-than-expected sales figures, despite a minor slow down in revenue growth. Overall, Meta’s net income jumped 35% year-over-year to $15.68 billion. “We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. Zuckerberg, on the company’s earnings call on Wednesday afternoon, said 500 million users are now interacting with Meta’s AI chatbot, which offers answers to users on apps like Facebook and Instagram. He also said the company would continue to invest in the long-term future potential of AI, AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality), despite growing concerns from investors over mounting losses at Meta’s Reality Labs division, which has booked losses of $24.2 billion over 2023 and 2024. Here are the top-line results: Revenues: $40.59 billion, up 19% from $34.15 billion in 2023. Meta’s Q3 sales topped analysts from Zack’s Investment Research estimated revenues of $40.21 billion. The company’s quarter-over-quarter revenue growth slowed from Q2, when the company reported a 22% annual jump in sales. As usual, the bulk of Meta’s sales — 96% — came from ads. Net income: $15.68 billion, an increase of 35% compared to $11.58 billion the year prior. Meta’s diluted earnings per share of $6.03 beat Zack’s estimate EPS of $5.19. The company’s Q3 profit topped its previous record for quarterly net income, which it set during the fourth quarter of last year when it posted a $14 billion profit. Daily active users: 3.29 billion DAUs across its family of apps — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads — by the end of September, up 5% year-over-year. Meta added 30 million daily users quarter-over-quarter, although the company didn’t share how those gains broke down by app. Threads: Zuckerberg said that Threads, the company’s social app that launched as a rival to X last year, now has 275 million monthly users. That’s up 37.5% from Q2, when the company said Threads was approaching 200 million monthly users. CFO Susan Li, on the company’s earnings call, said Threads has seen healthy growth in the U.S. and overseas markets including Taiwan. At the same time, Li said, “We don’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue.” Average price per ad: The average price of an ad on one of Meta’s apps increased 11% year-over-year, indicating the appetite for reaching users on Facebook and Instagram remains strong. Head count: Meta reported 72,404 employees at the end of September, up 9% from the prior year. Meta’s growth stands out, as many tech companies, including TikTok, have cut jobs in recent months. Guidance: Meta said it expects to report between $45 billion and $48 billion in sales next quarter. Facebook Reality Labs, the company’s unit dedicated to virtual and augmented reality hardware and software, continued to stick out like a sore thumb on Meta’s earnings report due to its losses. FRL’s operating loss was $4.4 billion for Q3, up 19% from the year prior. In the first nine months of 2024, Meta has lost $12.76 billion on FRL, which is currently developing its Orion AR-powered smart glasses. Zuckerberg is bullish on the future of smart glasses, saying last month they’ll “gradually replace phones by 2030.” And Meta appears unfazed by FRL’s mounting losses. The company expects “operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem,” Li on Wednesday. Zuckerberg added it was important for the company to continue investing in AI, AR, and VR, even if that’s not “what investors want to hear in the near-term” as losses grow. “The opportunities here are really big,” Zuckerberg said. The company’s stock, which has been red hot in 2024, took a momentary breather after Meta’s Q3 report posted. Shares dropped 1.5% in early after-hours trading to $583 per share. On the year, Meta’s stock is up 70%. Meta has continued its push into artificial intelligence in recent months, as the company battles Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as Microsoft-backed OpenAI in the budding sector. Last month, Meta announced its AI chatbot would be voiced by Hollywood stars like Kristen Bell and Keegan-Michael Key. And last week, Meta struck a multi-year deal with Reuters to include the news organization’s content in responses from its AI chatbot. In an effort to reduce its dependence on Google and Bing, Meta is also working to build its own AI-powered search engine, that would drive its chatbot’s responses. When it comes to another hot topic — politics — Meta has been conspicuously quiet during the run up to Election Day. In 2020, the company — after facing backlash for Russian bots being able to run ads during the 2016 presidential race — tightly policed COVID-19 and election news on its platform. Most notably, Facebook took steps to limit the distribution of a New York Post report on Hunter Biden, the son of then-nominee Joe Biden, in October 2020. This year, Meta has opted to deemphasize political content on its platforms, at the behest of Zuckerberg. Instead, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news to users. On the Instagram front, Meta announced last month it would start applying restrictions to kids’ accounts in an effort to make the app more “safe,” in the company’s words. Looking ahead, Zuckerberg said he was “pretty amped” about the work Meta is doing on the AI and AR/VR front. “This may be the most dynamic moment that I’ve seen in our industry,” Zuckerberg said on the Q3 call. “And I am focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead.” Your email address will not be published.

Title: What Blue Origin Stands to Gain After Jeff Bezos Muzzled the Washington Post
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-jeff-bezos-stands-to-gain-on-washington-posts-losses.html
Time Published: 2024-10-30T18:01:37Z
Full Content:
When Jeff Bezos published an op-ed on Monday defending his decision to kill the Washington Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, he included near the bottom of his 911-word article something of a preemptive attack against any suggestion he was motivated by money. Bezos, of course, is one of the world’s richest men. Much of his wealth depends the U.S. government, whether through contracts with federal agencies — like the internet services provided through Amazon Web Services — or merely being allowed to grow Amazon as large as it had. (In fact, it was only last year that the government sued it on antitrust grounds.) The day the endorsement was pulled, though, an executive of one of Bezos’s companies, Blue Origin CEO David Limp, met with Donald Trump in Austin, Texas. “I sighed when I found out, because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision,” Bezos wrote. “But the fact is, I didn’t know about the meeting beforehand. Even Limp didn’t know about it in advance; the meeting was scheduled quickly that morning. There is no connection between it and our decision on presidential endorsements, and any suggestion otherwise is false.” The Washington Post, which Bezos bought for $250 million 11 years ago, has borne the brunt of Bezos’s decision — the paper announced it has already lost 250,000, or 10 percent, of subscribers — but the implications may be far larger for his multibillion-dollar private-rocket company. Blue Origin is one of the many also-rans of the 21st-century space race, running far behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But unlike other rocket companies, Bezos’s is probably the most likely to seriously challenge Musk’s dominance during the next decade, thanks to his own $200 billion or so personal fortune as well as billions of dollars in government contracts. The path to Blue Origin getting bigger — including launching ever-more ambitious missions into space — depends not just on contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense but on federal approval of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Hanging over Bezos’s comments is the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that is currently suing Amazon for being a monopoly. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, but he has reportedly been deeply focused on the company since 2021. That was the year he stepped down as Amazon’s CEO and started flying rich, space-loving thrill seekers (including himself) just high enough that they could claim to be in space. At the time, he was not the only billionaire breaking free from earth’s surly bonds, as Richard Branson had beat him to sub-orbital heights by nine whole days. From there, though, the space race faded from public view. Branson’s company went public in a disastrous SPAC. Musk’s company appeared so far ahead of the competition that it won a contract to rescue astronauts stuck at the International Space Station — and eventually to drag it out of orbit. Setting aside the complex astrophysics of launching rockets into orbit, the billionaire space race at some level is also a contest of who can win the most government money. There are only a handful of companies that are capable of meeting the enormously onerous requirements laid out by NASA and the DoD. During the last decade, even before Bezos started dedicating himself to his extraterrestrial ambitions, he was reportedly focused on beating out Musk for the multibillion-dollar contracts to launch payloads and rockets. “Elon’s real superpower is getting government money,” Bezos said in 2016, according to the Washington Post. “From now on, we go after everything that SpaceX bids on.” Since then, though, SpaceX has become far more important as a government contractor, not only for shooting rockets into space but for its Starlink satellite-internet division, which has been crucial for governments and militaries around the world. Bezos, on the other hand, has found himself as the rare CEO who was out of favor in both the Trump and Biden administrations. In April 2019, the Post reported, then-Vice-President Mike Pence’s chief of staff alerted Blue Origin officials to Bezos’s poor reputation in the White House, telling them that they have a “Washington Post problem.” Trump had also said he wanted to “screw Amazon” out of a $10 billion deal to provide cloud computing to the Pentagon, according to a memoir by his Defense Secretary James Mattis. It’s since come out that Oracle, led by Trump donor and Musk mentor Larry Ellison, had set out to sabotage the deal. Things haven’t gotten any easier for Bezos under Biden, though. The administration has zeroed in on Amazon as well as other tech companies, including Google and Meta, for their market dominance. Lina Khan, the FTC Chair, argued that Bezos’s retailer was an illegal monopoly and should be broken up. (Amazon is currently fighting the FTC.) Last year, though, it looked like Bezos’s days in the political wilderness might finally be coming to an end. Boeing and Lockheed Martin were looking to unload their own joint-venture rocket company, United Launch Alliance. Boeing has had a terrible year and recently has had to tank its own stock price in order to raise capital. ULA had billions of dollars in government contracts, extensive infrastructure, and an experienced team. Bezos’s company, though, had lots of money and a motivated owner, and Blue Origin was reported to be the favorite to take it over. Even the head of the U.S. Space Force’s purchases seemed to be pushing for the two rocket companies to merge, telling an industry audience that “they need to scale” in order to meet an aggressive launch schedule. This is where the story of ULA becomes, in one of Bezos’s favored words, a “complexifier.” When Boeing and Lockheed formed the company in 2005, one of its biggest challengers was none other than Musk. SpaceX was a new company at the time, and Boeing and Lockheed effectively controlled this slice of the space industry. When the Federal Trade Commission considered clearing the way for the joint venture, it noted that the Department of Defense was “concerned that Boeing and Lockheed will have an incentive to defend ULA’s monopoly by refusing to consider on equal terms any other launch-service competitors that may emerge, such as SpaceX.” An FTC commissioner “reluctantly” approved to the deal in 2006, based on a complex oversight agreement with the DoD, and conceded that ULA would become a “monopolist.” If anything, the opposite happened. Because of ongoing problems with its planes, strikes, and aggressive competition, Boeing is now reportedly thinking of selling off its entire space business, in addition to ULA, a choice that would have seemed unthinkable just a decade ago. But while ULA has lost market share to SpaceX, it is still a major force in the space industry, competing for dozens of launches during the next four years, which can bring in billions more revenue. A roll up with Blue Origin would make a lot of sense from a corporate standpoint. (At one point this July, Bezos sold more than $5 billion worth of Amazon stock, which seemed to hint that something big was about to come. After all, he partly funds the company through sales of Amazon shares.) Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Blue Origin had even submitted a bid to buy it. It’s not clear why ULA hasn’t been acquired yet. Blue Origin didn’t return a request for comment. If Bezos wanted to grow Blue Origin, though, he hardly would have been able to rely on Trump to allow a deal to sail through. Bezos said that the decision to kill the op-ed wasn’t motivated by his Blue Origin business, but he doesn’t mention how the meeting between the company’s CEO and Trump came to be, only that “the meeting was scheduled quickly that morning.” (NPR reporter David Folkenflik broke the news about it.) There is still a lot that isn’t clear about why the Post never ran an op-ed. What’s more certain is that, regardless of what was discussed beforehand, it will probably help build Bezos’s business from here on out.

Title: Increasing Ways To Get AI Investment Exposure

Time Published: 2024-10-30T17:41:28Z

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has clearly been the dominant investment theme of 2024 and is the next major technology wave. According to IDC, spending on AI will be in excess of $631 billion by 2028. With ever increasing interest and spending in AI, there are also a rising number of ways to participate in this massive theme. ETF baskets are a great way to gain exposure. Just this week, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, launched two new ETFs, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF (TEK). There are likely many more on the way. However, not all are created equal. Some of the beneficiaries of AI may not be immediately obvious. These include Data Center REITs like Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX) as well as companies that are involved with the construction the infrastructure for data centers as represented in the ETF PAVE. Also, the need to generate increased electrical production in the U.S. has had a positive effect on Utilities. In addition, nuclear power is making a comeback in the U.S. Hence, uranium stocks are performing better as one can see in the performance of URA. Stronger Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 1: Weekly Charts of Leading AI-Related ETFs Weaker Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 2: Weekly Charts of Lagging AI-Related ETFs Broad Market ETFs: Figure 3: Weekly Charts of the Above Two ETFs There are many use cases for AI, most relating to costs savings and efficiency/productivity gains across nearly every sector. Some of the larger being search assistance, automated machine learning, data-driven marketing, fraud/network intrusion detection, financial robo-advisory, supply chain optimization, factory automation, self-driving technology, drug discovery, and more recently generative AI, among others. There will be many opportunities in those companies that can harness the technologies. But we would like to now take a closer look at some of the beneficiaries of all of the spending happening to create the necessary infrastructure, in particular the powering of all of the growing use cases: data centers. In terms of data centers, according to industry estimates, the market size could rise from around $200B in 2022 to nearly $450B by 2028. McKinsey notes that electricity demand from data centers is expected to rise by over 150% by 2030. It usage will rise from under 2% compared to total installed capacity to >4% over the period. While it is a small portion, it is still a huge amount of new power needed. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) account for around 40% of the data center capacity. Non-hyperscalers (colocation) account for ~25% and on premise for the remainder. Figure 4: Growth in Data Center Electricity Demand As we mentioned in our May Forbes article, “Power Up Your Portfolio With Utilities,” United States overall electricity demand should rise +1 to 3% a year for the next decade. Current estimates could continue to rise. Other more aggressive estimates put the percentage of electricity consumption from data centers in the high-single digits by 2030. Recent power supply deals from Microsoft and Alphabet underscore the coming growth, as well as the continued need to shift towards clean energy sources. Although the Nasdaq 100 and Mega Cap growth groups were huge outperformers over about an 18-month period from the beginning of 2023, they have trailed off in relative terms recently. There has been a shift in leadership from the spenders (hyperscalers) as the leaders to the infrastructure product and services, and energy providers, particularly related to data centers. Below are 25 O’Neil Industry Groups related in some way to data centers, detailed with some price performance and other metrics. Nearly all have been winners over the trailing 52 weeks, however, over eight to 13 weeks, there is a large separation between the top few and the rest. Figure 5: List of O’Neil Industry Groups Related to Data Centers In Conclusion The AI revolution offers many exciting investment opportunities beyond simply semiconductors and software. In particular, companies that construct, operate, and power data centers are likely to be strong beneficiaries of this massive trend. We encourage investors to explore these areas in greater detail as we believe many of these stocks will be market leaders over the next decade.­­ Kenley Scott, Director, Global Sector Strategist at William O’Neil + Co., made significant contributions to the data compilation, analysis, and writing for this article.

Title: BXP Touts 25% Year-Over-Year Increase in Leasing Activity in Third Quarter
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/10/bxp-third-quarter-earnings/
Time Published: 2024-10-30T17:28:48Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Boston-based developer, owner and manager BXP touted a boost in its leasing so far this year, as leasing activity grew by 25 percent in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year. During the third quarter, BXP — formerly known as Boston Properties — signed 74 leases totaling more than 1.1 million square feet with an average term of 7.2 years. “Our performance in the third quarter demonstrated BXP continued resilience and provided evidence of property and capital market recovery,” BXP Chairman and CEO Owen Thomas said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. “Interest rates, corporate earnings, return to the office behavior, outperformance of premier workplaces and valuation in the public and private markets are all currently working in our favor.” The growing return-to-office movement has been a particular boon to BXP’s leasing activity, Thomas said on the call. And that doesn’t appear to be slowing, especially when you consider giant employers such as Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks and Salesforce have all recently initiated some kind of mandatory return-to-office policy for white-collar workers. Indeed, some 83 percent of global CEOs are predicting a full — pre-COVID-19 style — return to office within the next three years, according to 2024 KMPG data. “Asking rents for premier workplaces are 50 percent higher than the broader market,” Thomas said, noting that “approximately 90 percent of our [net operating income] comes from assets located in [central business districts] that are predominantly premier workplaces. The CBD assets are 90.1 percent occupied and 92.1 percent leased as of the end of the third quarter.” When it comes to the New York City market, BXP is still searching for an anchor tenant for its planned office tower at 343 Madison Avenue. But earlier this month BXP broke ground — alongside the Metropolitan Transportation Authority — on a new Grand Central Terminal entrance that will be accessible from the building’s concourse. “When complete, the building will comprise 942,000 square feet, and include state-of-the-art sustainability features, as well as direct escalator access into Grand Central Terminal,” Thomas said on the call. “We hope to launch this approximately $2 billion project next year.” For the first three quarters of 2024 — across all markets — BXP completed 3.3 million square feet of signed leases, Doug Linde, president of BXP, said on the call. Beyond the third quarter, BXP’s pipeline of leases sits at 1.5 million square feet, a 15 percent jump compared to the 1.3 million square feet it had in the works after the second quarter. “If we execute most of the remaining leases during the fourth quarter, we will end the year at over four and a half million square feet of transactions,” Linde said. Additionally, the firm reported its third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct. 29 with revenue rising 4.2 percent to $859.2 million for the quarter, compared to $824.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net income was $83.6 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, and it had a net loss of $111.8 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter. BXP stock was trading in the red on Wednesday afternoon at $82.01 per share, a nearly 5 percent drop from its opening price. Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

The company's stock price was down slightly in after-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Sales in the third quarter jumped 19% year over year while net income grew 35% to $15.7 billion from $11.6 billion a year earlier. That represents Meta's lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023. The company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion. Meta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses. "Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts. Zuckerberg has been pointing to the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence, which includes spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company's core online ad business in the aftermath of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update. The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy. More than one million advertisers have used Meta's generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said. Meta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion. Meta's advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter. Revenue from Meta's Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company's slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein would affect Meta's overall revenue. Meta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion. The company's Reality Labs hardware unit posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts' expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts' expectations of $310.4 million. Since 2020, Meta's Reality Labs unit has recorded an operating loss of more than $58 billion. The company's overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30. The social media company's results come a day after digital ad companies Alphabet, Reddit and Snap all reported solid quarterly earnings. Microsoft reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines. Alphabet on Tuesday said third-quarter sales from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers. Microsoft on Wednesday reported that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services. Apple and Amazon report quarterly financials on Thursday.

Title: Earnings Preview: What To Expect From Meta

PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration, the Meta logo is displayed on the screen of ... [+] an iPhone in front of a Facebook logo on October 29, 2021 in Paris, France. On October 28, during the Facebook Connect virtual conference, Mark Zuckerberg announced the name change of Facebook, believing that the term Facebook was too closely linked to that of the platform of the same name, launched in 2004. It is now official, the Facebook company changes its name and becomes Meta. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Meta Platforms scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $602/share and is currently trading near that level. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: Click on the chart to join MarketSurge The company is expected to report a gain of $5.19/share on $40.14 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $5.41/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78, in 2021 the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. Looking forward, the company is expected to grow its earnings to $21.38 in 2024 and then $24.48 in 2025. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 30 which is only 1.3x the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting very well and just hit a fresh all-time high. In the short-term the stock is extended and can easily pullback if earnings fail to impress. That said, the stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Meanwhile, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Bezos And Griffin Weigh In (Updated)

Time Published: 2024-10-30T15:01:22Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 83 billionaires supporting Harris and 52 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): In a strongly worded editorial in the Bezos-owned Washington Post, the centibillionaire explained his decision to reportedly strike down the newspaper’s endorsement of Harris amid a storm of controversy, explaining he believed it would help restore the public’s faith in the paper’s journalism. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” wrote Bezos. Ken Griffin: Griffin (Citadel) confirmed he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” UPDATE (Oct. 29): Griffin, one of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in the world and one of the deepest-pocketed Republican donors in prior election years, told Bloomberg financial markets’ “expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,” echoing a chorus of Wall Street money flows seemingly pricing in such a scenario. But regardless of who wins, “the reduction of uncertainty is almost positive for asset prices and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” offering a positive prognostication for investors. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison: Ellison is one of the most surprising billionaires who has stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering he has donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in the primaries. A total of 83 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: The news outlet Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: (Updated Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. (Updated Oct. 28): Bloomberg donated another $50 million to the same non-profit organization backing Harris, the Times reported Monday. Bloomberg was already the most prolific individual donor to Harris groups this cycle, and his total financial commitment toward Democratic causes now reportedly approaches nearly $100 million. Also, Duolingo founder Luis von Ahn endorsed Harris, declaring the Democratic candidate is “the better option for the US economy.” (Updated Oct. 30): Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former Republican governor of California, said he will vote for the Harris/Walz ticket in a lengthy social media post. Noting he has “plenty of disagreements” with Harris’ platform, Schwarzenegger slammed fellow celebrity-turned-politican Trump as “un-American,” declaring another Trump presidency would bring “four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.” A total of 52 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: (Updated Oct. 16) The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings. He gave another $43.6 million to a pro-Trump committee from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, becoming the second-most prolific donor in Trump’s camp this year, trailing only Adelson. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. (Updated Oct. 22): The New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What Wall Street Thinks of Meta Platforms Stock Ahead of Earnings

Shares of Meta Platforms (META) ticked higher in early Wednesday trading ahead of the company's next round of financial results, due after the bell. The results are set to arrive with the company's shares up nearly 70% this year—and Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly bullish on the shares, though at present calling for comparatively little further update. Of the 30 analysts tracking shares of the Facebook and Instagram parent company as of Wednesday morning, 28 had "buy" or equivalent ratings on the stock and two had "hold," according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts' price targets, meanwhile, ranged from around $500 to $675. The median target, $613.72, represents a premium to Tuesday's close of a bit more than 3%. Meta stock was recently up about 0.3% to just over $595. Meta's results are due on the heels of a report last night from Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), whose shares recently were up about 16% after the company turned in 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the latest quarter and a smaller loss. Here's what you need to know about Meta's coming earnings report.

October 30, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Oct. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from 10 diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing 35,000 metre drill program. The ten drill holes reported today represent both shallow and deep drilling on the Project’s mineralized “Trend #s 0, 1 and 2.” Included are two wedges performed on the deep drill hole OB-24-324, which returned 27.61 g/t gold over 6.0 metres with extensive visible gold at a depth 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource on “Trend #1” (see Radisson News Release dated September 24, 2024). Also reported today are results from drill hole OB-24-323 which represents a 100-metre step-out below the base of the Mineral Resource on “Trend #0.” The new data, taken together, continue to demonstrate the extension of high-grade O’Brien mineralization to depth, where it remains open. Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “Today’s drill results continue to demonstrate the type of narrow high-grade intercepts within broader mineralized envelopes that are so characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The drill holes reported today represent a balance between shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and deeper step-outs geared to new discovery. This reflects the drilling priorities set in May when our 2024 program was expanded to 35,000 metres; however, we are becoming increasingly focused on the deep expansion potential of O’Brien. Recall that DDH OB-24-324, released in September, returned almost an ounce of gold over 6 metres core length at 1,100 metres vertical depth, 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. Now, wedges drilled from this hole, and a step out hole 100 metres below the Mineral Resource on Trend #0, are giving more high-grade intercepts at previously untested depths. Three rigs are currently active, with one rig committed to drilling directly beneath the historic O’Brien mine for the first time in the Project’s history. This pilot hole is expected to be more than 1,600 metres in length and will test for gold mineralization more than 400 metres beneath the deepest mine workings. Success with this hole offers to dramatically change the potential scope of the Project.” Table 1: Summary Assay Results from Today’s Drill Holes Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length, so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill holes OB-24-324W2 and 329 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au. Assay results for drill holes OB-24-327 and 328 are pending. Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P, S3P: Conglomerate; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North; TX: Crystal Tuff. Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Today’s Drill Holes Illustrated Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focused on delineating well-developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5,” Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from ten drill holes, including two wedges, over 3,895 metres in Trends # 0, 1 and 2. Visible gold was observed in six of the holes. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -50 and -80 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Drill holes OB-24-324W1 and W2 were wedges drilled off the previously reported, high-grade hole OB-24-324, which had extended Trend #1 170 metres beneath previous drilling with two zones of 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres and 6.83 g/t Au over 10.0 metres, including 40.2 g/t Au over 1.5 metres (Figure 2). Wedge OB-24-324W1 successfully intersected two zones of mineralization immediately above hole 324, with 5.48 g/t Au over 12.4 metres, including 12.10 g/t Au over 4.4 metres, and 8.02 g/t Au over 4.2 metres. Wedge OB-24-324W2 deviated from its intended target eastwards and returned a number of mineralized zones of 1-2 metres in thickness at 1-2 g/t in gold grades (Table 2). Drill holes OB-24-325 to 332 tested targets within the existing vein model in Trend #1, between approximately 200 and 350 metres vertical depth. Of note, OB-24-332 returned 16.21 g/t Au over 5.4 metres, including 32.25 g/t Au over 2.4 metres. Drill hole OB-24-333 was a shallow hole targeting Trend #2 at approximately 200 metres vertical depth, returning 62.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. Results are pending for drill holes OB-24-327 and 328. Figure 2: Cross Section of Trend 1 Locating Drill Hole OB-24-324, Wedges OB-24-324W1 and OB-24-324W2, and the Previously Published OB-96-071 and OB-20-174W1B Drill Holes Drill hole OB-24-323 was located approximately 100 metres below drilling on the high-grade Trend #0, immediately adjacent to the O’Brien mine. It returned two broad mineralized zones of 3.34 g/t Au over 10.9 metres, including 13.90 g/t Au over 1.5 metres, and 3.51 g/t Au over 8.2 metres, including 9.93 g/t Au over 1.5 metres. This successfully extends Trend #0 to depth. Table 2: Detailed Assay Results (see “Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts”) Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size. Assays were completed on sawn half-cores, with the second half kept for future reference.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rises 0.8 percent as investors bet on strong earnings from Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. US tech stocks have catapulted the Nasdaq to a record high as investors bet on strong earnings from corporate heavyweights. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.8 percent on Tuesday, as Google’s parent company Alphabet reported forecast-beating earnings for the third quarter. Alphabet’s revenue jumped 15 percent to $88.3bn during the July-September period, while profit surged 34 percent to $26.3 bn. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company was experiencing “extraordinary” momentum due to the strong performance of its search and cloud businesses as well as its focus on innovation, including artificial intelligence. “Our commitment to innovation, as well as our long-term focus and investment in AI, are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers,” Pichai said on an earnings call. “We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation, and we’re now seeing this operate at scale.” Alphabet’s share price rose nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading. The tech giant’s strong performance comes ahead of hotly-anticipated earnings results this week from Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon, all of which registered stock price gains on Tuesday. Shares of Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple rose 2.62 percent, 1.3 percent, 1.26 percent and 0.12 percent, respectively. Tesla, another of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks that account for more than one-third of the market, dropped 1.14 percent, after soaring 22 percent last week following a forecasting-beating profit in the third quarter. The broader market saw only a modest rise, with the benchmark S&P 500 inching up 0.2 percent. The strong performance of tech giants was offset by slumps by corporate giants including Ford and JetBlue Airways, which saw their stock price sink 8.4 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.

Nifty extended its recovery for a second consecutive session on October 29 rebounding well from morning lows. Banks (including PSU Banks) did well for the second consecutive session. Nifty formed a bullish candle on October 29 after forming a triple bottom in the 24073-24140 band and closed at its highest in 5 sessions. Its indicators are giving positive signals. The short term trend of Nifty seems to have turned bullish. Nifty could take support from the above band while on upmoves it can face resistance in the 24567-24694 band in the near term. Tuesday’s reversal higher in the nifty after an opening slump has the potential to further the near-term recovery. There are two reasons why this may occur. One, Monday’s rally created a Japanese “bullish harami” candlestick pattern, which got validated as yesterday’s recovery broke through the Friday high of 24,440. Two, historically, whenever the Nifty has fallen at least 0.5% below its previous close and recovered to settle a minimum of 1% above the same day’s low, the next few days have seen the market extend its advance. From the March ‘23 lows, this signal has been seen 11 other times, and in 8 of those instances, the nifty was higher by an average of 1.2% over the next 5 days. That said, any break below the Friday low of 24,074 will negate this potential rally. In yesterday’s session, Nifty and banking stocks made a solid comeback, with the advance-decline ratio favouring the bulls at 3:2. As we head towards the Diwali Muhurat session on Friday, November 1, 2024, market sentiment is expected to remain positive, buoyed by key drivers such as short covering ahead of the October F&O expiry, value buying, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a sharp drop in oil prices below $67.50, and strong Q2 results from PSU banks like SBI, ICICI Bank, and Bandhan Bank. With this improving risk-on sentiment, a ‘buy on dips’ strategy is recommended for Nifty and Bank Nifty, while Siemens stands out as our top pick for a bullish move.

Limited to select stock picks, Gravita India, National Aluminium Company, Jyothy Labs, NCC, and SBI emerge as top choices from brokerages like Axis Securities and Kotak Securities. Gravita India stands out with growth potential in battery recycling, while Nalco’s wind power and alumina expansions drive optimism. Jyothy Labs benefits from robust revenue growth, and NCC’s infrastructure projects show strong earnings potential. SBI’s tech innovations and consumer lending strength also make it a favored pick. Experts also highlight SIPs in small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds as prudent long-term investments. Nuvama Wealth Management’s overall AUM growth was robust with it totaling ₹4.4 lakh crore at end Q2F-Y25. The PAT number of ₹260 crore was up 77 per cent y-o-y and it beat our estimates. Capital markets stole the show with a 90 per cent and 98 per cent y-o-y growth in AUM and revenues, respectively. The recent equity market rule changes or even a equity market slowdown should still lead to elevated levels in the division’s performance. The wealth businesses saw hiring of RMs (relationship managers) leading to elevated C/I ratios but we believe the ratio to taper down in the medium term. Management is confident to bring cost to income ratio to below 60 per cent in the next 2-3 years. Tata Technologies’ Q2-FY25 earnings call aptly summarises the concerns highlighted in our ‘Know the cycle’ thematic report on automotive ER&D. Management believes the strategic consideration between electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids led by polarised policy positioning ahead of the US presidential elections, and regulatory concerns related to Chinese OEMs and associated tariff in the Europe is leading to decision-making delay, tapering of demand, and smaller deal sizes as customers are cautious to committing larger, long-term projects.

As Silver prices are trading at record high levels, it is advised to buy precious metal as an auspicious small token amount and not huge lumpsum this Dhanteras/Diwali in the form of physical silver coin, a few units of Silver ETF or some token amount in Digital Silver. One should wait for the Silver prices to correct and retrace to about $31 (~Rs 88500) in November/December and then accumulate precious metal at those levels. The best way to increase allocation into precious metal is to start the SIP or increase the amount of your Silver systematic purchases every month. Silver prices are expected to continue their uptrend in the next few months for the target of $38(~Rs 115,000) . So the strategy should be buying on dips at the mentioned levels for a 20% upside target in the next few months. -- Prithviraj Kothari, Managing Director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions Limited (RSBL) The stock idea that we have for you today is ICICI Securities.
