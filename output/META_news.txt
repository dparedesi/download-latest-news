News Microsoft will be discontinuing its HoloLens 2 headset once stock runs out, according to UploadVR. The mixed reality headset HoloLens 2 debuted in 2019, three years after its predecessor, the HoloLens, launched. Due to its hefty price tag, the product is mostly marketed towards businesses and enterprises. Production is grinding to a halt, and security updates will continue until December 31, 2027. Software updates will stop after that. Microsoft apparently does not intend to produce a third iteration of the HoloLens, as it’s believed that the company has canceled the project due to ‘lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges’. The mixed reality team has slowly dwindled as well this year and the last. The HoloLens IVA will continue as a system and an AR headset for the US army. Microsoft recently brought its Office apps and Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest headsets and will be working with the company for Windows 11 integration. iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc.

Title: This is probably your last chance to get the 128GB Quest 3, but it's not the only VR headset discount I'd recommend right now

Don't wait around on this, because stock is already disappearing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We finally got confirmation last week that the Meta Quest 3S is real, and it's arriving this year. As a few rumors hinted though, it does mean that Meta is discontinuing some of its existing headsets to make room for a more affordable model. The Quest 2 and Quest Pro have been drifting in and out of stock for a while now, so while it's sad they'll now be officially retired, it's the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3 I'm more surprised about. The 128GB Quest 3 only launched this time last year and it's been one of the most accessible VR headsets worth buying ever since. VR games are relatively small, so for many people, paying more for a 512GB SKU hasn't been all that necessary. Since the announcement the 128GB version's death warrant was signed though, it feels like it's entered clearance mode. In the US, Best Buy is one of the last remaining suppliers with stock available, and it's reduced the device's price from $499.99 down to $429, giving you a sweet $70 saving. In the UK, Amazon has followed suit, dropping the cost to just £409.99 down from £479. It goes without saying, but I've not seen the Quest 3 hit this low a price tag since it launched last year, and I've been keeping a close eye on the headset's deals in that time. Amazon's US stock of the 128GB Quest 3 has already disappeared entirely, so if you're wanting a cheaper route into Meta's flagship device, I wouldn't wait around. I'd be surprised if this VR headset didn't transition into a collector's item by the time Prime Day Meta Quest deals officially start next week. Meta Quest 3 128GB | $499.99 $429.99 at Best Buy Save $70 - The 128GB Meta Quest 3 probably doesn't have much stock left, so this $70 saving is a great way to grab one before your only option is the more expensive 512GB SKU. As an added bonus, you'll also get a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow when it launches later this year. Buy it if: ✅ You want more storage space ✅ You want mixed reality features ✅ You're interested in playing SteamVR games Don't buy it if: ❌ You already play games on a PS5 UK: £409.99 at Amazon But why is the Quest 3 being discontinued, I hear you ask? Well, since the Quest 3S is targeting that more approachable market of first-time VR buyers or those who don't want to invest more than $350 on a standalone headset, the Quest 3 proper needs to stand out as an enthusiast device. Limiting choice to the 512GB model only distinguishes it from the competition, since other standalone headsets tend to offer less storage. While it's certainly sad that the Quest 3 128GB is no more, you can take solace in the fact that the 512GB SKU has now dropped in price slightly as well. In the UK and US, it's cheaper than it's ever been, dropping to $499 down from its original MSRP of $649, or £469 in the UK. That's an amazing reduction in its own right, although it's a massive slap in the face to anyone who bought that headset in the last few months at a higher price. Regardless of which Quest headset you buy, you'll get to benefit from the Batman Arkham Shadow pre-order bonus that's available for the Quest 3S. In all of Quest 3's life so far, this question has never been so hard to answer. If you want the best Quest headset in terms of its internal specs, but you don't want to spend money on a version with more storage, then absolutely jump on this 128GB model clearance sale. Truth be told, you'd struggle to fill up 512GB of space even if you use the headset daily for gaming and work. VR titles really are surprisingly small, so 128GB is more space than you'd think. That said, the competition has never been so fierce. Not only do you have the Meta Quest 3S to think about now, but if you're in the UK, you have the Pico 4 Ultra to consider, which is arguably better than the Quest 3 anyway. HTC Vive is also re-entering the consumer market with the Vive Focus Vision, which is a much higher-end device targeted at PC gamers. Then, you have what I'd argue is the Quest 3's biggest competition, PSVR 2. Almost like clockwork, Sony's headset has dropped in price as well. Its MSRP is $549, and Walmart is currently listing it for $449, a whole $100 cheaper. In the UK, you can grab one for just £500 at Amazon, which really puts it up against the new price of the 512GB Quest 3. Any direction you look in, you have amazing opportunities to get into VR gaming at the moment. All of these headsets are worth the money, and as a lover of this technology, I couldn't be happier to say that. Competition is great for any industry, and since this has always been prohibitively expensive hardware, all of these discounts mean that more people will be able to get their heads in a visor. If that's the case now, I can't wait to see what Black Friday VR headset deals and Black Friday Meta Quest deals have in store.

Microsoft confirms no HoloLens devices will be supported after 2027 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has officially confirmed it will be halting production and sales of its HoloLens mixed reality headsets. In a statement to UploadVR, the company said it has ended production of the HoloLens 2 device, the latest model (albeit one released in 2019), with customers only now able to buy new devices while stock lasts. Microsoft HoloLens 2 will continue to receive "updates to address critical security issues and software regressions" until December 31 2027, the company noted. The news may come as little surprise, as Microsoft has not been focusing too much attention on HoloLens in recent years, as the company's focus drifts more towards AI, despite HoloLens 2 users finally getting a Windows 11 software update in April 2023. The original HoloLens headset, which will see software support end on December 10, 2024, was launched in 2016, with the company promising a new age of augmented and virtual reality experiences. However initial reception and sales were poor, as was the case for the HoloLens 2, partly due to its $3,500 price tag at launch, which placed it firmly in the range of enterprises only. This included specialist editions built for the US Department of Defense, with the US Army remaining committed to the wide-scale test of its HoloLens IVAS device in 2025. An initial order of 5,000 headsets, thought to be worth around $373 million, was signed off by Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Douglas Bush in September 2022 following successful field tests. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The company had apparently been considering plans for a HoloLens 3 device, but appeared to quietly drop this following layoffs and financial cutbacks that affected the project’s workers. The former head of the HoloLens division, Alex Kipman, also departed Microsoft in 2022 following misconduct allegations, with the likes of Meta and Apple making the headset space far more congested.

Title: What is Databricks?

Time Published: 2024-10-02T04:39:03Z

By: John Miner | Updated: 2024-10-02 | Comments | Related: > Azure Databricks Databricks, Inc. is a data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark. The Platform as a Service (PaaS) has evolved over the years with support on Microsoft Azure and Amazon cloud-based platforms. Databricks purchased six companies to add features to its offerings, such as ML OPS, Data Governance, and Generative AI. As a new data engineer, how can I quickly get up to speed using the Databricks platform? At the core of Databricks' offering is the Apache Spark Engine. Initially, this engine was written in Object Oriented Java (Scala). However, the demands of big data have increased, requiring additional speed. Databricks added Photon to the Runtime engine. Photon is a new vectorized engine written in C++. The image below shows the traditional offerings from the Spark Ecosystem. These four areas will be covered at a summary level today. I suggest trying to use the Photon engine due to its speed. The image below is from the Databricks website. Just remember that this offer comes at an additional price. Check to see if you meet both your SLAs for data processing and monthly operating expenses (budget). Our manager has asked us to provide a high-level overview of the Databricks ecosystem to our senior management. The company has a large amount of data in an aging on-premises data center. The goal is to understand what is Databricks and associated ecosystem for business intelligence, data analytics and decision making. The above table outlines the topics that will be discussed in this tip. One nice feature about Databricks is that it can run on all three major cloud vendors (AWS, AZURE, GCP). Regardless of the technology, engineers refer to the data plane and control plane. The control plane is where coding and scheduling can be done. Most services depend on a cluster, the distributed computing power for Spark. See the architecture diagram below for details. Data engineering is just a fancy name for the extract, transform, and load (ETL) logic packaged in a workflow (job). The use of each step is up to the end user. I might extract (read - data source) from an Azure SQL database and load (write - data destination) to a parquet file using Spark Dataframes. Typically, when dealing with a data lake, one uses medallion zones. The quality of data improves as you go from left to right. The above image was taken from a Microsoft Technical Community article by Mike Carlo. There are two ways to work with files in Apache Spark: Let's start with two sample CSV files that contain weather data. The goal of this exercise is to read the high temperature and low temperature CSV files. Let's join the two dataframes and save them as a Parquet file. The above code loads the low temperate data into a dataframe named df1. The code below loads the high temperate data into a dataframe named df2. The code below writes the results of joining the two tables to a Parquet file. Any duplicate columns are deleted from the results. The syntax for the dataframes has a little learning curve. The PySpark code above was executed on a single node cluster. Without a cluster, no work gets done. The same ELT process can be coded using Spark SQL. The Spark language supports the following file formats: AVRO, CSV, DELTA, JSON, ORC, PARQUET, and TEXT. There is a shortcut syntax that infers the schema and loads the file as a table. The code below has a lot fewer steps and achieves the same results as using the dataframe syntax. The SELECT statement retrieves the first 5 records from the weather table located in the default database schema. There are two types of hive tables: managed and external tables. Regardless of table type, the DELTA file format is the only one that supports ACID transactions. Any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements executed by the end user against another file format will result in an error. The ACID properties of the DELTA format are achieved by using Parquet data files, Parquet check point files, and JSON transaction logs. To recap, data engineering within Databricks can be done in many ways. Things constantly change in technology. Databricks added the autoloader feature so that engineers did not have to keep track of new vs. old files. The delta live tables (DLT) is a declarative framework that simplifies data ingestion and allows for quality constraints. Both techniques are based on streaming and will be covered in a future tip. The warehouse is a relatively new addition to the Databricks ecosystem. The public preview of the service was released in November 2020. Please see the release notes for details. The SQL Warehouse computing power is measured differently than the Spark Clusters. Please see the documentation for details. With data engineering, you must pick the number of nodes, virtual machine series/size, access mode, and Databricks runtime engine and make any additional Spark configurations. Typically, the computing cluster is spun up with an optional auto-terminate value, which saves the client money by not having the virtual machines running 24 x 7. This computing cluster can be used for interactive tasks or job workflow execution. Most importantly, the computing cluster is carved out of the clients' cloud account. The computing power for the warehouse is measurable and is considered serverless in nature. No virtual machines ever show up in the client's cloud account. These clusters are owned by Databricks Service, are in a warm state, and are used for SQL workloads only. Please see the image below for an extra small cluster size named "Starter Warehouse." The SQL Warehouse environment is built around the schema explorer, the ability to run queries, create reports, add reports to dashboards, and define alerts based on queries. At this point, we are going to rebuild the weather table using the SQL Warehouse and Spark SQL. The code below creates a database (schema) named mssqltips with a comment. Comments are invaluable when a data governance tool is used to harvest predefined tagging. The design pattern below is important to understand. It will be used two times to create tables for both the low temperature and high temperature data files. First, if a managed table exists, we want to delete it. Second, we want to create an empty Delta Table with no schema. Third, we want to use the COPY INTO statement with the correct options. The file format and format options define the source file. Since we want to use the inferred schema from the file, we need to set the copy option to allow merging of schemas. The above code loads the low temperature data, while the code below loads the high temperature data. The last step is to create a view to join the two tables. Please note that the Spark SQL language allows for comments at the table level, view level, and the column level. The image below summarizes the options the developer has with the SQL warehouse: edit new queries, view saved queries, create dashboards from visuals, create alerts based on queries, view query history, and manage warehouses. In short, we can see we have two tables in the hive meta store. A simple SELECT statement of the view we created with a limit of five records is shown below. To recap, many of the data engineering features that you can do with Python can be done with the SQL Warehouse. I will cover the details of this service in a future tip. There are many ways a data engineer can stream data into a data lake. This section with introduce the simplest use case where CSV files are stored in an Azure Storage Container. We will be using our S&P 500 stock data in this example. The source data files are in a CSV format and the data processing is called structured streaming. The first task is to understand how many source files we have in the raw zone. This can be done by calling the list files method of the file system class in the dbutils library. There are six stock data files from 2013. We always want to use a schema file when dealing with weak file formats. Please see the Spark reference for SQL data types. This comes in handy when crafting a schema string. The maximum number of files that can be processed per triggered stream is set to two files. This number was picked to show you that three triggered events are needed to process six files. There are many options with Spark streaming. Other options include processing all available files in the source folder now and running the streaming process as a continuous event. The check below should always return true. The chances that the incoming stream is correctly formatted are low. We want the date column to be a timestamp that we can use in our Spark SQL queries. Additionally, information such as load time, path to input file, and various parts of the path might be important to the end user. The following code uses the withColumn to create new fields for our dataframe. The writeStream method appends the two CSV files loaded by the readStream method to a delta file. The checkpoint file is very important. This keeps track of files that have been processed. Thus, files will not be re-processed if they are listed in the checkpoint file. To rebuild a delta table, it is best to delete the "streaming" directory, which includes both the delta files and the checkpoint files. The writeStream action will stop once the readStream data is consumed. We can check the status of the write process using the code below. The last step is to stop the stream. This is a very important step that is sometimes overlooked. It is always important to check the results of executing a notebook. We expect two files to be loaded for every triggered event. The query below executes an aggregation directly against the delta file. The expected results show groups of records having the same load date. This section is a brief introduction to streaming. Future articles will talk about autoloader and delta live tables. These two features have changed how big data programmers ingest data. However, both methods are built upon the core Spark streaming concepts. The Graphframe project was introduced to the Spark ecosystem in the summer of 2016. It allows designers to supply vertices and edges as dataframes to the API. Then, interesting social networking questions can be asked. The image below shows a typical network of friends. The image below shows the two Spark Dataframes that are input to the Graphframe. Methods on the Graphframe object can be used to retrieve results from the graph. For instance, how many people are older than 33 or how many people have two or more followers? Please see the detail behind this section's content in a Databricks Engineering Team blog post. There is a knowledge graph use case that has been done with both Airline Flights, Insurance Policies and Life Sciences. Here, we only scratched the surface of what can be done with graph models. There are many different algorithms to retrieve information stored in their structure. A future article will be needed to dive deeper into the subject. Machine learning (ML) can be used to solve various problems, such as classification, regression, text analysis, image recognition, recommendations, and clustering. Here is a great cheat sheet on when to apply which algorithm (technique). The goal of this section is to understand what a data scientist can achieve by using Databricks. The first step in any ML project is to retrieve, clean, and prepare features. Because the data lake can store a variety of files, this is a prime location for the data scientist to explore what is available. The second step is to create a model. Many different algorithms and/or feature selections might be tried until a solution that has an acceptable prediction rate is achieved. The data for creating an algorithm is grouped into two sets. The training data set is used to create the model. The testing data set has a known set of outcomes. We use this set to judge the accuracy of our model. Databricks released ML Flow as an open-source framework in June 2018. Please see the release notes for details. Three key problems are solved by ML Flow: tracking, projects, and models. See the Databricks initial blog on the framework. Why is tracking important? The creation of models is like a lab experiment. Under certain conditions, predictive accuracy is achieved. Both the data and model might change over time. If our ML model drifts over time, the framework is a great place to find out why. The registry allows us to redeploy saved models that might achieve better results. Finally, we need to deploy our model to production. There are many ways to use the model like point-in-time scoring using web services or batch scoring over stored rows in a database. The framework can help with those problems, too. There are many ways to get data into a data lake. Both Spark Dataframes and Spark SQL can be used to ingest and transform your existing files stored in cloud storage. Traditionally, a medallion architecture is used to enhance the data quality as files are moved between the zones. I will talk about advanced data engineering services such as autoloader and delta live tables in the future. To compete in the Data Warehouse computing sector, Databricks created the SQL Warehouse service. The main difference between data engineering and this service is how a cluster is deployed. With traditional clusters, all the nitty gritty details must be configured. The computing power is carved out of the owner's subscription. The SQL Warehouse is considered serverless and T-shirt sizes are used to pick a configuration. The COPY INTO statement is key to getting data from files into DELTA tables. There is only support for the SQL language since this is a Data Warehouse. Other features that you might be interested in such as schedules, reports, dashboards and alerts in will be covered in a future article. The lambda architecture is based upon two lanes. The slow (batch) lane can be handled by the initial data engineering techniques that I covered. The fast (speed) lane is handled by streaming. Today, we covered how structured streaming can process files stored in a storage container. The read and write stream are important methods to learn. There are a couple techniques on how to handle transformations within micro batches. These topics will be covered in a future article. My first introduction to directed graphs was the Traveling Salesperson problem. The key idea behind this problem is there are customers in N cities and directed traveling routes. Starting at the home office, how can you visit all the clients? This problem can be optimized for travel distance, time traveling, and/or total cost. Unfortunately, the Graphframe library cannot solve this problem. However, it can solve other problems such as querying properties of the vertices and edges. It can solve the shortest path problem from one vertex to the next. Please see the documentation for more details. Machine learning has evolved over the years. What I learnt five years ago for my EDX Data Science certificate is totally different than what is available today. Regardless of the libraries and algorithms you are using, the data scientist needs a framework to track projects and models. The key purpose of a data lake is to have all the data in one place so that the data scientist can start feature selection. The clean-up of the data into an ingestible format is the lion share of the work. The selection and tuning of the ML model takes time and iterations. That is why tracking is so important. Finally, the model can be released to production. The work does not stop there. Periodic checking of the accuracy will notify you if the model has drifted and changes are required. This whole process is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops). In summary, today's tutorial is a high-level coverage of five different products that are part of the Databricks ecosystem. I hope you enjoyed the overview and look forward to going deeper into each topic in the future.

Californiaâs Napa Valley wine industry is world-renowned, generating $50 billion annually in economic impact.1âEconomic impact,â Napa Valley Vintners, accessed September 20, 2024.The wines produced among the 700 wineries in the region rival those of any other region across the globe. The story of the Napa wine industry is a familiar one. Only a few decades ago, the region was a rural outpost with a small community of mostly independent vineyards. It boomed after investors and entrepreneurs worked together, put their product to the test, and won awards against the worldâs best in the 1970s. Napa is just one example of places and industries springing up from humble beginnings to become global successes. Dalton, Georgia, is considered a global carpet capital.2George Pendle, âDalton, GA: How a bedspread fiefdom became a carpet kingdom,â Atlas Obscura, July 7, 2015. Eighty-five percent of the carpets sold in the United States and 45 percent sold globally are made in the region. Similarly, High Point, North Carolina, is a global hub for furnitureâat one point the region was responsible for producing 60 percent of all furniture sold in the United States.3âFurniture history: High Point & furniture,â High Point Museum, accessed on September 25, 2024. Its biannual markets host exhibitors from around the world. Today, Napa wineries, Dalton carpet companies, and High Point furniture factories are a mix of big and small businesses, and in many cases still include family-run operations. They succeeded not only because of their product but also because of their ability to efficiently produce it at scale. The regionsâ success illustrates how, under the right conditions, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) in any industry can expand their global reach. Productivity is a measure of how efficiently goods and services, or output, are produced, compared with the amount of inputs used.1âInvesting in productivity growth,â McKinsey Global Institute, March 27, 2024. In macroeconomic terms, it is defined as the value of the goods and services produced, divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required for its production. For this report, we focus on labor productivity, measured as value added per worker (in US dollars at purchasing-power parity). While the more accurate measure of labor productivity is value added per hour workedâas the number of weekly hours worked varies substantially among US states. For example, the average weekly hours worked by production employees on manufacturing payrolls in the United States varied from 27.7 hours in Alaska to 44.3 hours in Louisiana in 2023.2âState and metro area employment, hours, & earnings,â US Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 2023. We use the per-worker metric, as it is more commonly available across size categories and sectors. Due to the lack of comprehensive data at the individual company level for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, we rely on subsector-level average productivity to make inferences.3We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational-productivity research often studies issues related to attrition, disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, âSome employees are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,â McKinsey Quarterly, September 11, 2023. To get there, US MSMEs should look to ramping up productivity, a move that will be vital to American competitiveness in the coming years (see sidebar âMeasuring productivityâ). Small businesses can reach the next level of growth by taking advantage of new technology, including generative AI (gen AI), and partnering with bigger companies, and they will need the infrastructure and systems to support them. The McKinsey Global Institute aggregated a richly granular data set of MSMEs and large companies across 12 broad sectors, 68 level-two subsectors, and more than 200 level-three subsectors in 16 countries with different income levels, accounting for more than 50 percent of global GDP. In this group (listed by per capita GDP in 2021 in purchasing-power-parity terms) are ten advanced economies (the United States, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Japan, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and six emerging economies. MSMEs play a large role across the boardâin the advanced economies, they average 66 percent of employment and 54 percent of value added. The United States has an ample small business engine. MSMEs, defined as businesses employing up to 500 people, are a major foundation of economic activity, responsible for 58 percent of jobs and 39 percent of value added in the business economy (Exhibit 1). In some US business sectors, MSMEs have an outsize impact. They account for more than three-fourths of workers and value added in the construction sector, for example. And they account for more than half of all workers and value added in the professional services and accommodation and food sectors (Exhibit 2). MSMEs also help fuel the US economic engine. Companies that were MSMEs at some point since 2000 now represent 17 percent of publicly traded companies valued at $10 billion or more as of 2023 (Exhibit 3). Small technology companies have made the biggest breakthroughsânearly a quarter of large public tech companies were MSMEs in the past 25 years, Meta and Zoom Video Communications among them. Many of todayâs big manufacturing companies also started as small factories. Monster Beverage and Tesla are recent examples. Innovation has been a big factor in fast-scaling companies. Small companies in the tech sector have produced more patents per employee than their bigger competitors.4Robert D. Atkinson, The National Economic Council gets it wrong on the role of big and small firms in U.S. innovation, Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, July 20, 2023. The United States enjoys a status as a global leader in business, with 621 of the 2,000 largest global publicly traded companies, according to Forbes, and is home to a disproportionately high number of very large, highly productive companies or superstars.5Hank Tucker, âInside the Global 2000: United States grows more dominant among worldâs largest companies,â Forbes, June 13, 2024; âSuperstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global economy,â McKinsey Global Institute, October 24, 2018. However, when it comes to small business productivity on a global scale, US MSMEs are comparatively average. US small businesses, in purchasing-power-parity terms, are roughly on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Among the ten advanced economies we studied, small companies are, on average, 60 percent as productive as big businessesâbut US small companies are just 47 percent as productive (Exhibit 4). Small business productivity varies by sector. While, on average, US MSMEs are on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy, they lag in a few sectorsâmining, transportation and storage, and administrative services. Additionally, they trail in some technology subsectors such as computer programming and some manufacturing subsectors such as basic metals, machinery and equipment, and furniture. The productivity ratio relative to large companies also varies by sector. In the United States, it ranges from 35 percent in mining to 88 percent in the administrative-services sector (Exhibit 5). In other words, MSMEs in the mining sector face the widest gap in productivity relative to their large peers in the same sector, closely followed by information and communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing. On the other end, MSMEs in administrative services come closest to performing as productively as their large peers. In fact, in a few sectorsâadministrative services, professional services, transportation and storage, and retail and wholesale tradeâmedium-size businesses with 50 to 499 employees perform at the same level or even better than large companies (with more than 500 employees). But, apart from accommodation and food, microenterprises with ten employees or less and small enterprises with ten to 49 employees are less productive than medium-size enterprises, which are on average twice as productive. Overall, the gap widens as the company size gets smaller. The vast productivity gap can be partially explained by differences in the kind of work undertaken by small and large businesses. Small businesses play a crucial role in enabling the productivity of large companies, which tend to focus on core competencies and outsource less essential activities to other businesses, a phenomenon called work fissuring.6David Weil, âUnderstanding the present and future of work in the fissured workplace context,â Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, 2019, Volume 5, Number 5. This results in greater concentration of higher-value-added activities in large companies, with smaller businesses taking on lower-value work. But ultimately, the productivity ratio depends on advantages of scale in areas such as technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies. For example, the share of MSMEs that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies.7The OECD model survey on ICT usage by businesses: Second revision, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015. Large companies are twice as likely to provide formal skilling programs and are more active in monitoring performance and awarding performance bonuses.8McKinsey Global Institute analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2013â22. MSMEs derive just 5 percent of their total sales from direct exports, which is one-third of the sales made overseas by large enterprises. The share of large businesses using banks for working capital financing is 1.5 times that of small businesses. Consequently, the MSME productivity ratio tends to be lower and the productivity gap wider in sectors where these competencies play a significant role in driving business competitiveness. MSMEs are ubiquitous across all states, but their economic contribution is uneven. On one end are states such as Nevada and South Carolina, where small businesses employ around half the workers and represent about 35 percent of receipts in the business economy. On the other end, in states such as Montana and Vermont, about three-fourths of employment is in small businesses, generating about 55 percent of those statesâ receipts (see sidebar âHow small businesses fared during the COVID-19 pandemicâ). Among the top 40 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) by employment, small businesses account for between 25 and 50 percent of receipts and between 50 and 70 percent of employment in the business sector (Exhibit 6). The number of new businesses registered each year in the United States increased dramatically during the pandemic. Over 2019 to 2021, the number of new businesses registered increased by 54 percent. However, while new businesses were registered, existing businesses closedâand their numbers appear to be in balance. The net number of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) increased by only 6 percent between 2019 and 2021 (exhibit). On the other hand, despite the number of new business registrations growing only by 10 percent in the prepandemic period from 2017 to 2019, the net number of MSMEs grew by 4 percent, and their employment also increased by 3 percent. A relatively higher number of MSMEs appear to have survived during this period. Despite the significant increase in new business registrations during the pandemic, these businesses did not generate proportionate employment, with the net workforce in MSMEs falling in half the states over 2019 to 2021. On average, the number of MSME workers fell by 1 percent in the United States. The proportion of workers employed by MSMEs stayed stagnant for the most part. This suggests that the industry structure might be gradually changing, with some small businesses growing into large companies, or more employees moving from smaller to larger companies, transitioning to more productive work. Overall, this is the right direction of movement for the United States. This variation in the economic contribution of MSMEs across states and MSAs is also reflected in their performance, measured as receipts per worker as a proxy for productivity. Some of these differences could be attributable to differences in price levels across states. Clearly, states with higher prices might generate higher receipts per worker than states with lower prices, independent of any true differences in performance. So to compare the true performance of MSMEs across regions, we measured the receipts that MSMEs generate for every worker in each state and in the top 40 MSAs by employment, adjusted for regional price parity.9Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise receipts per worker for each state and each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are adjusted to account for the differences in price levels of goods and services, using regional price parities (RPPs) sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. RPPs are calculated using expenditure data from the consumer price index, which is aggregated into broader expenditure categories and then allocated across regions using a multilateral aggregated method that expresses a regionâs price level relative to the United States. RPPs may not completely reflect the extent of price differentials within a state or MSA, particularly in areas with significant economic disparities. Across sectors, MSMEs are assumed to generate revenue locally within the state, while large companies are assumed to generate revenue globally, nationally, or regionally.10As a result, we adjust micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise (MSME) receipts per worker, depending on regional price parities in a state or metropolitan statistical area, but do not adjust large-company receipts. We adjust for all sectors equally. This approach has drawbacks in sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and information and communications technology, wherein a sizeable share of MSME revenue generation might be nonlocal. We estimate that this limitation could imply, approximately, a 15 percent variation around the mean. Similar limitations apply to large companies that might primarily generate receipts locally in certain sectors, such as a large restaurant chain only operating in a few states. MSME performance varies significantly across states (Exhibit 7) and MSAs (Exhibit 8). Their performance goes hand in hand with large-company performance. In general, where large companies perform better or poorer than the national average, so do MSMEs, and vice versa. MSME performance relative to large companies is concentrated within a narrow band. In more than 30 states with 70 percent of all MSME employees, small business receipts per worker are 45 to 55 percent that of large businesses. However, among the top 40 MSAs, there is a larger variation. The same relative performance band of 45 to 55 percent comprises only 15 MSAs, accounting for only 30 percent of employment. So why do MSMEs in some states and metros perform better than others? Reasons could include differences in the business environment and policies. Some states have tax, regulations, and compliance systems that support the expansion of large and small companies alike. Some states have more deeply ingrained business networks, greater availability of financing, and a concentration of talent, which provide a boost to MSMEs that struggle to access these competencies. Capturing the MSME productivity potential is vital for US competitiveness amid a changing world: geopolitical shifts, net-zero transitions and the rise of the green economy, and greater healthcare needs for an aging population, along with the developments in gen AI (see sidebar âHow generative AI can propel small businessesâ). There is already a tech adoption divide between large and small businesses. The share of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies. However, there is scope for democratization of tech access with recent AI developmentsâmuch of the new software targeted at small businesses is expected to have AI, and even generative AI (gen AI), embedded in them. Such gen-AI-enabled products and services can be used with natural-language prompts, rather than advanced IT skills. This democratization makes AI more accessible to small businesses, but also raises the cost of nonadoption. It can potentially create a divide between small businesses that embrace technology and those that donât. For example, if previously the difference between a business that adopted technology and one that didnât was creating email marketing campaigns versus printing marketing flyers, now the difference will be the tech-friendly MSMEâs ability to launch substantial digital marketing campaigns with a simple prompt, with the ability to analyze the effectiveness of the campaigns and tweak them easily. The productivity lift for such a company could be considerable. The effective use of data will rise in importanceâand small businesses can struggle with this, from both a scale and sophistication point of view. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often have a wealth of data, and gen AI tools can help them leverage that data to grow their business. So how can small businesses implement these technologies effectively? Here are several trends to consider: Although conditions vary across states and MSAs, the low productivity levels of small businesses are holding back US competitiveness. Narrowing the MSME productivity gap is equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDPÂ (Exhibit 9).11âA microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity,â McKinsey Global Institute, May 2, 2024. The tremendous variation in MSME productivity ratios across countries suggests there is ample room for improvement in many sectors in the United States. While meaningful benchmarks vary based on local conditions, we compare the average productivity ratio of MSMEs to that of large US companies with a top quartile ratio across the ten advanced economies we studied at a subsector level. Retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, construction, and ICT account for the bulk of the productivity opportunity by virtue of their large share of national output and employment. The largest opportunity is in wholesale and automotive tradeâwhich is almost 35 percent. In these sectors, MSMEs in the United States are only 38 percent as productive as large companies, a figure that is low relative to other advanced economies. For example, MSMEs in the automotive-trade sector in Japan are 62 percent as productive as large companies. They are more vertically integrated with large manufacturers, enabling efficient logistics that follow just-in-time principles and respond effectively to market fluctuations.12Christina L. Ahmadjian and Joanne E. Oxley, âVertical relationships, hostages, and supplier performance: Evidence from the Japanese automotive industry,â Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, 2013, Volume 29, Number 3.Â Similarly, wholesale trade MSMEs in Germany are 83 percent as productive as large companies. They benefit from market-leading innovation and vertical integration with upstream purchasers, such as retail supermarkets or distributors for large manufacturers, across the entire European Union.13Bernhard Dachs et al., EU wholesale trade: Analysis of the sector and value chains, The Vienna Institute for International Economics Studies research report, number 415, June 2016; Matthias Fauth, Benjamin Jung, and Wilhelm Kohler, âGerman firms in international trade: Evidence from recent microdata,â Journal of Economics and Statistics, 2023, Volume 243, Number 3â4. US businesses can take inspiration from these countries to improve their productivity. Moreover, US manufacturing supply chains are realigningÂ across the electronics, automotive, and pharma sectors, for example. The CHIPS and Science Act offers new spending and opportunity for MSMEs tied to semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.14âFact sheet: CHIPS and Science Act will lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,â The White House, August 9, 2022. In the electronics industry, MSMEs generate 22 percent of value added, accounting for 2 percent of the productivity opportunity. The automotive industry accounts for another 2 percent, which may improve the competitiveness of the American electric-vehicle industry. Additionally, the recent surge in biotech investments is another opportunity for MSMEs. They generate 18 percent of value added in the pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and biotechnology sectors, and their productivity opportunity accounts for 2 percent of the total. A competitive manufacturing economy requires efficient logistics, but in the United States, transportation companies are less efficient than their advanced-economy counterparts. MSMEs in the transportation sector account for 6 percent of the productivity opportunity. As the United States works to rebuild its public infrastructure and improve its supply of housing stock, as well as undertake capital expenditures in building renewable energy infrastructure, there will be an increased demand for construction services, a sector particularly dominated by MSMEs, with significant room for productivity improvement. Twelve percent of the productivity opportunity can come from small businesses involved in construction. The productivity imperative is even more important in the context of labor force shortages in the construction sector.15âHelp wanted: Charting the challenge of tight labor markets in advanced economies,â McKinsey Global Institute, June 26, 2024. Labor market tightness in the United States is among the highest across advanced economiesâmaking it challenging for the US economy to grow through employment alone. Almost three-fifths of job openings in March 2024 wereÂ in states with lower-than-average performance of MSMEs relative to large companies (Exhibit 10). Boosting MSME productivity could enable states to close that labor gap by offering workers higher pay and nonpay benefits, or by reducing hiring needs because they produce the same output with fewer workers. Either way, the small business gains. For small businesses, the road to higher productivity involves accessing four key competencies: technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies, explaining wider productivity gaps in sectors where they are vital for competitiveness. How can small businesses better develop these competencies? An answer lies in what may seem, at first, an unlikely source: networks and interactions with other, usually bigger, businesses. Business-to-business interactions fuel MSME productivity and help them narrow the productivity gap (Exhibit 11). Businesses large and small should reconsider whether they have an adversarial approach to one another. Policies that attempt to create incentives, quotas, or protections that tilt the balance toward either small enterprises or larger ones arenât necessarily the solution. The truthâbroadlyâis that both MSMEs and large companies can benefit when they are operating within the right economic conditions. Large companies could help smaller companies acquire competenciesâbut itâs not a one-way street. Small companies help large companies as customers, suppliers, and sources of new ideas. In fact, the productivity of large and small companies tends to move hand in hand in most sectors. Boosting interactions between them could raise overall productivity for everyone. Our analysis of a wide cross-section of subsectors across emerging and advanced economies suggests that MSME and large-company productivity move in tandem in most subsectors, indicating spillovers if the right conditions are established. In the United States and in other advanced economies, there are multiple examples of winâwin relationships between MSMEs and large businessesâtemplates for what has already worked. There are four kinds of models: larger companies innovating products and services targeted at helping small companies raise performance, intentional collaborative partnerships between small and large companies, more organically formed regional business clusters, and sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Serving small-business customers with offerings that boost productivity. MSMEs could interact with larger businesses as their customers. They could benefit from improving their overall efficiency and ability to invest in more technology and capabilities. Large companies can sell MSMEs productivity-boosting products and services and drive revenue growth. In short, small businesses could gain assets previously unavailable to them, and big companies could grow by selling those assets. Many small businesses have integrated with software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to automate back-end operations and build capabilities in areas like compliance, tax, and accounting, thereby eliminating the need for people to perform these tasks. For example, a large HR solutions provider created a chat-based app specifically for small businesses to handle payroll. Another provider supports small businesses in hiring and onboarding. Other such collaborations help small businesses outsource managerial tasks, saving time for the owners at a fraction of the cost of a full-time employee, including tools for writing business plans, cloud-based project management tools, calendar tools for tracking time and building itineraries, and virtual assistants that record conversations, transcribe interviews, and generate summaries. MSMEs have also collaborated with other companies to expand their market reach, by utilizing products that enable them to accept digital payments, create content for marketing, and run an effective ad campaign. MSMEs are also integrating with providers to manage their finances in real time, seamlessly connecting with banks, accountants, and other business applications. And larger companies are using these digital footprints, such as merchant point-of-sale transactions, to enhance small business credit scores, helping businesses that might not otherwise qualify for financing. Collaborative partnerships fostered through supply chains. Collaborations between large and small companies can generate mutual benefits. Partnerships help larger businesses by giving them added resilience and flexibilityâthey also help MSMEs by building know-how, human capital, and market access. For example, in advanced-manufacturing industries, which require inputs from multiple suppliers such as semiconductors, automotive, and wind turbines, close collaboration between large integrators and suppliers helps suppliers reach new markets. Some contractual partnerships between Toyota and its suppliers have lasted for more than 30 years. Toyota has directly involved itself in raising the operational standards of its partners through knowledge transfer, from demand planning and cost reduction to raising management capabilities.16StÃ©phane Heim, âCapability building and functions of SMEs in business groups: A case study of Toyotaâs supply chain,â International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 2013, Volume 13, Number 4. IBM, in collaboration with other Fortune 500 companies, launched the Supplier Connection initiative that connects small suppliers to one another and to large businesses to access new opportunities.17Freddie Pierce, âIBM launches new Supplier Connection portal,â Supply Chain Digital, May 17, 2020. One study of small businesses in New York found that seven in ten of them increased their revenue within two years of becoming part of a corporate supplier base.18Giving small firms the business, Center for an Urban Future, March 2011. Sharing technology is a big part of the benefit. In the consumer-packaged-goods industry, large companies have improved the efficiency of fragmented suppliers by providing advanced digital and analytics tools that smaller companies do not have. The Global Lighthouse Networkâa World Economic Forum initiative in collaboration with McKinseyâhas identified multiple companies that have achieved productivity improvements of up to 250 percent in some factories.19Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at speed and scale, World Economic Forum, December 2023. Some companies have focused on lifting the capabilities of the small business workforce through training programs that help them succeed as suppliers. One exampleÂ is Appleâs $50 million fund to provide learning and skills development opportunities for the employees of its suppliers, launched in collaboration with the International Labour Organization and the International Organization for Migration.20âApple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund,â Apple press release, March 30, 2022. Another is NestlÃ©âs Nescafe Plan, which has provided training to small coffee farmers on techniques to increase crop yields.21Mark Segal, âNestle commits over $1 billion to sustainable coffee farming plan,â ESG Today, October 4, 2022. Finally, small companies can gain financial access by working with bigger companies. Some large companies use their relationships with financial institutions to advocate for small suppliers who may otherwise be unable to access credit or who may receive unfavorable rates. In Colombia, DuPont used its relationship with a financial institution to secure working capital credit for its MSME suppliers in rural areas. This, in turn, strengthened their supply chain and stabilized procurement.22Partnerships for small enterprise development, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. Vibrant, organically formed business clusters of large and small companies. In some industries and areas, such as Silicon Valley or the furniture industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan, small and large companies have formed regional networks of people, ideas, and financing. Small companies gain from concentrations of capital and talent drawn to the area by universities and large companies. Large companies gain from the innovation and entrepreneurialism of smaller ones (for example, through acquisitions). In Sacramento, a different kind of cluster has developed. Like Silicon Valley, the Sacramento cluster boosts the areaâs natural advantages by connecting large businesses, start-ups, academic research, and private capital. But the Sacramento agtech cluster replaces silicon chips for wine grapes, synthetic proteins, and irrigation systems.23âIndustries: Agri-food techâ Greater Sacramento Economic Council, accessed on September 20, 2024. People add capabilities, too. Drawn by the University of California (UC), Davis, which has a strong agricultural science department, large companies conduct biotech research in the area; the concentration of research labs, educated labor force, and expertise gives small start-ups an advantage over similar-size competitors. One example is Scout, a vineyard management start-up founded by a tech executive and a professor at UC Davis.24Vince Vitale, âNapa-based AI for vineyards closes $3 million in funding,â Press Democrat, April 9, 2024. The Sacramento cluster also provides infrastructure and financial access to MSMEs. Foodtech and agtech start-ups have access to wet labs, lab space, and manufacturing spaces that are set aside specifically for agtech start-ups. AgStart, a nonprofit, provides lab equipment, a commercial-grade kitchen, and event centers and has incubated more than 20 start-ups. mall businesses have gained access to capital, either through acquisition by another company, venture capital involvement, or public sector grants earmarked for developing the area. Sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Collaboration among companies could be encouraged by enhancing digital data and financial infrastructure, establishing a training ecosystem and creating a level playing fieldâin turn, fueling productivity for small businesses. An open data framework, for instance, could enable financial institutions to use nontraditional data sources for credit underwriting, targeted at a range of underfinanced companies, including MSMEs. An Experian study showed that including utility data allowed 20 percent of âthin fileâ credit customersâthose with scant documentation to support their credit applicationsâto become âthick fileâ customers who have higher loan approval rates.25Let there be light: The impact of positive energy-utility reporting on consumers, Experian, November 24, 2014. A focus on boosting technical competence can enable growth among all companies, small and large. For example, while national labs are mandated to share research with companies, small companies seldom utilize these resources. Improving marketing efforts and providing incentives could encourage greater participation. Policy makers can play a role in promoting technology adoption. An example of this is Singaporeâs GoBusiness initiative, which provides financial support for all businesses that adopt technology solutions to improve their business processes, in line with industry road maps. Establishing a training ecosystem can help MSMEs access crucial technical and strategic expertise. Examples include the United Statesâ Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which provides small businesses with access to a national network of hundreds of specialists, who offer services ranging from supply chain management to industrial design, technology-driven market intelligence, marketing and sales, and more. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which administers MEP, estimated that the program interacted with more than 36,000 small manufacturers in 2023, helping to create or retain more than 100,000 jobs.26âMEP economic impacts boost business and jobs,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, April 1, 2024.Â For every dollar of federal investment, it also generated nearly $25 in new sales growth and $28 in new client investment, with a cumulative cost savings of nearly $3 billion.27âManufacturing Extension Partnership: About NIST MEP,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, updated February 9, 2024. Greater collaborations among MSMEs can also raise productivity through knowledge sharing, mentoring, networking, and collectively benefiting from investments. Business leaders and policy makers can join forces to create a pathway to greater MSME productivity. Small businesses can start the process by working with one another. There are three main considerations that could shape stakeholder actions: create a winâwin economic fabric, adopt a granular and tailored approach, and foster networks and connections. In many ways, what spurred the Napa wine industry to world-class status can happen across industries and regions in the United States. Just as Napa vintners shared resources and, in some cases, partnered with bigger wineries, industries as disparate as retail and construction can also use the tools afforded by existing, bigger players in their sectors. Pushing productivity among MSMEs is essential as the United States seeks to remain a global economic powerhouse. Indeed, many of todayâs great American companies have humble beginnings. Nurturing a new crop of small American businesses will keep the US economy vibrant, its workforce growing, and its status strong for seasons to come.

Microsoft is planning to discontinue its mixed reality HoloLens 2 headsets, according to a report from UploadVR. Production on the HoloLens 2 is ending, and sales will cease when stock runs out. Security updates will be provided until December 31, 2027, but after that point, Microsoft plans to end software support for the HoloLens 2. Microsoft was one of the first companies to delve into mixed reality technology, and it introduced the original HoloLens in 2016, following up with the HoloLens 2 in 2019. The HoloLens headsets have always been expensive and Microsoft has targeted them to enterprise customers rather than the general public. At the current time, Microsoft does not appear to have plans for another HoloLens headset. There were rumors of a version three back in 2022, but work was reportedly canceled due to a lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges. Microsoft has also been downsizing its mixed reality team in 2023 and 2024. Microsoft does apparently plan to continue supporting its HoloLens IVAS, which stands for integrated visual augmentation system. It is an AR headset that Microsoft is creating for the U.S. Army, and it is set to be tested in early 2025 to determine its feasibility for full-scale production. As Microsoft has been winding down its work on the HoloLens, it has partnered with Meta to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming and its Office apps to the Quest headsets, and it is also working on Windows 11 integration with the Quest. Apple's Vision Pro headset has been marketed to both consumers and enterprise customers unlike the HoloLens, but it currently shares some of the same shortcomings, such as a high price tag. Apple is not yet ready to abandon mixed reality, and there is another version of the Vision Pro in the works. A second AR/VR headset could come as soon as 2025.

Title: Vaginal Tritrichomonas foetus infection in mice as an in vivo model for drug development against Trichomonas vaginalis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308672

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE.

Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

Distance scale is shown on the bottom left. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g006 To confirm that the T. foetus proteasome is functionally similar to T. vaginalis, we analyzed the accumulation of ubiquitin-labeled proteins after proteasome inhibition by western blotting. For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

Wall Street is heading for a lower open on the first day of October. The S&P 500 had a positive September for the first time in five years. September is historically the worst month of the year. With a 5.5% gain in the third quarter, the S&P 500 enters the seasonally bullish period into year-end up nearly 21% in 2024. 2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday the central bank is not on a preset easing course, signaling smaller rate moves going forward after September's 50-basis-point cut. The next big event that could influence the Fed and the stock market comes Friday when the government releases its September employment report. 3. Pivotal Research initiated Club stocks Meta Platforms and Alphabet with buy ratings and respective price targets of $780 per share (35% upside to Monday's close) and $215 (28% upside). The analysts see strong revenue growth ahead for Meta and a "deep moat" competitively at Alphabet. 4. Citi raised its Medtronic price target to $92 per share from $85, though analysts remained cautious. The best medtech alternative is Club name GE Healthcare, which has a newly FDA approved diagnostic agent and a tailwind from Fed rate cuts going for it. GEHC shares have been a top performer in our portfolio lately. 5. Stephens started Club name Danaher with an overweight buy rating and a $315-per-share price target, implying roughly 13% upside. The analysts see a pickup in biotech funding and Chinese economic stimulus as positives, putting the life sciences giant in a better position next year. 6. Barclays said Apple is seeing weak demand for its new AI-ready iPhone 16. Club members know that I am always skeptical of these so-called channel checks. I have said it over and over again, the expected robust upgrade does not have to happen all at once. 7. Citi upgraded Anheuser-Busch Inbev to buy from neutral. Is a large buyback coming? In beer, we own Modelo and Corona brewer Constellation Brands, which reports earnings before Thursday's opening bell. Constellation reset expectations last month and the market took it in stride. We want to see what's next. 8. KeyBanc raised its Netflix price target to $760 per share from $735. Who would have thought that of the FANG and "Magnificent Seven" stocks the video streaming giant would be the best? Meanwhile, Raymond James downgraded Club name Disney to a market perform hold rating. The analysts are concerned about the moderating parks business. 9. East Coast and Gulf Coast union port workers went on strike after a midnight labor contract deadline came and went. It was the first walkout by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977. Costco and Home Depot were among the Club names that were preparing for the work stoppage. 10. Wells Fargo cut its Boeing price target to $110 per share from $119 and kept its sell-equivalent rating on the aircraft maker. Boeing factory workers have been striking for nearly three weeks. Bloomberg reported that Boeing is thinking about a $10 billion equity raise.

Title: Allurion reports average 12.5% weight loss in latest study
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/allurion-reports-average-125-weight-loss-in-latest-study-93CH-3642683

Full Content:
NATICK, Mass. - Allurion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ALUR), a medical technology company focused on obesity treatment, has published a systematic review and meta-analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of their Allurion Program. The analysis, which synthesized data from 11 observational studies involving 2,107 patients between 2016 and 2024, revealed an average weight reduction of 12.5% and a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) of 4.75 kg/m2 after four months of using the Allurion Balloon. Dr. Ram Chuttani, Chief Medical Officer and Founding Partner of Allurion, emphasized the importance of the findings, stating that the meta-analysis not only confirms the weight loss and BMI reduction outcomes but also highlights the metabolic health benefits associated with the program. These benefits include improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia levels. The Allurion Balloon, a key component of the Allurion Program, is a swallowable and procedure-less intragastric balloon designed to aid weight loss. It is complemented by the Allurion Virtual Care Suite, which includes a mobile app for consumers, insights for healthcare providers, and a connected scale. The program has been documented in 26 peer-reviewed journal articles and has been used by over 150,000 patients globally. While the Allurion Gastric Balloon is still considered an investigational device in the United States, the company reports a low rate of serious adverse events at just 0.90%. This data is based on the press release statement by Allurion Technologies and is intended to inform about the recent findings related to the Allurion Program. The full study can be accessed through a published article in a peer-reviewed journal. Investors and those following the medical technology sector may note that Allurion's approach to weight loss is part of a broader trend in the industry towards non-surgical and digitally supported therapies. However, as with all medical treatments, outcomes can vary, and regulatory approvals play a significant role in the availability and adoption of new technologies. In other recent news, Allurion Technologies reported a 25% increase in its second-quarter revenue to $11.8 million. Despite this, the company revised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance downward to $40 to $45 million due to regulatory and macroeconomic challenges. Roth/MKM recently initiated coverage on Allurion with a Buy rating, highlighting the potential U.S. approval of the company's weight-loss balloon. Chardan Capital Markets also maintained a Buy rating on Allurion's stock but reduced the price target to $2.50. Allurion has appointed Keith Johns to its Board of Directors, who brings extensive experience from the metabolic drug industry. The company reported safe and sustained weight loss in adolescents and patients using its Allurion Program, according to recent studies. However, Allurion faces a potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange due to non-compliance with the exchange's minimum share price requirement, but plans to address this issue within the allotted six-month cure period. These are some of the recent developments for Allurion Technologies. While Allurion Technologies' meta-analysis demonstrates promising results for its weight loss program, the company's financial health presents a more complex picture. According to InvestingPro data, Allurion's market capitalization stands at $39.45 million, reflecting its position as a smaller player in the medical technology sector. Despite the company's impressive gross profit margin of 76.19% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which aligns with the high-value nature of its innovative weight loss solutions, Allurion faces significant challenges. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company is "quickly burning through cash," which could be a concern for investors considering the capital-intensive nature of medical technology development and commercialization. Another InvestingPro Tip reveals that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year, with revenue growth showing a negative 23.59% in the last twelve months. This projection contrasts with the positive clinical outcomes reported in the meta-analysis, suggesting a potential gap between clinical success and market penetration. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Allurion Technologies, providing a more comprehensive view of the company's financial situation and market position. These insights could be particularly valuable for investors looking to understand the full picture beyond clinical data. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Is This A Good Stock to Buy for Long Term?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-amzn-good-102609100.html

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks. On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market. According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome. He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks. As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets. Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle. Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China. Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term. Our Methodology To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries. The company is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Speaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation. Amazon’s growth is undeniable which explains its position on our list. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 17% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Taylor Swift, Magic Johnson, Sam Altman: The American Billionaires Too Poor To Make The 2024 Forbes 400 List
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2024/10/01/taylor-swift-magic-johnson-sam-altman-the-american-billionaires-too-poor-to-make-the-2024-forbes-400-list/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T10:00:00Z

There aren’t many things $1 billion won’t get you, but a spot on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans is one of them. Not even $3 billion will do it. This year, the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. are all worth at least $3.3 billion—a new record, and $400 million more than last year. That high bar means scores of America’s most prominent billionaires are simply not rich enough to make the cut. In fact, for the first time ever, there are more U.S. billionaires not on the list—415 and counting—than on it. These too-poor billionaires include celebrity moguls like Oprah Winfrey (estimated net worth: $3 billion), Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion), Magic Johnson ($1.2 billion) and Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion). Dozens of prominent tech and finance leaders don’t have enough scratch either, including virtual reality scion Palmer Luckey ($2.4 billion), Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), Bilt Rewards founder Ankur Jain ($1.2 billion) and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ($1 billion). Of course, there’s always next year. Just ask Jayshree Ullal, the president and CEO of Arista Networks, who was $100 million too poor in 2023 but, over the past 12 months, has ridden Arista’s skyrocketing stock price onto The Forbes 400 for the first time, with an estimated $4.4 billion net worth. And Altman may rank among the richest 400 Americans soon enough, too: According to multiple reports, OpenAI is currently discussing a restructuring that would change it from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation, and give Altman equity in the company for the first time. Bloomberg reported he may get a 7% stake in the newly restructured firm; Altman denied this to OpenAI staff last week, saying there are no plans for him to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. Though it may change soon, the CEO of OpenAI currently has no equity in the artificial intelligence giant he runs. Instead, he’s made a fortune through smart venture investments, including stakes in Stripe, Reddit and Helion, a research company looking to build the world’s first fusion power plant. OpenAI told investors that it’s expecting to soon close on a new funding round, which according to reports could value the firm at as much as $150 billion. The action star joined Forbes’ billionaires list earlier this year after our reporting revealed how he parlayed $500 million in Hollywood earnings into a diverse investment empire. His most valuable asset: a minority stake in one of the world’s biggest investment funds, Dimensional Fund Advisors. Seinfeld is the richest comedian in America thanks to lucrative syndication profits from his namesake TV show, including a five-year, $500 million deal with Netflix. Forbes named “The Boss” the latest entertainer to become a billionaire in July. His fortune comes from a lifetime of touring and selling records, as well as a $500 million deal to sell his music catalog in 2021. Jain is the founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards, a New York City-based credit card issuer that allows users to gain rewards – including airline and hotel points – off their rent payments. The company raised $200 million from private investors at a $3.1 billion valuation in January. The NBA superstar built his fortune off the court, including buying stakes in the Washington Commanders NFL team and Los Angeles Dodgers MLB team. His biggest asset, however, is a 60% stake in the $27 billion (assets under management) life insurance company Equitrust. A former door-to-door fax machine salesperson, Blakely made her fortune founding the shapewear brand Spanx. In August, she unveiled her latest invention: a stiletto-heeled sneeker called “Sneex.” The founder of online fashion retailer Fashion Nova – known for its social media and celebrity marketing – has spent $300 million over the past four years buying up Los Angeles real estate. In August, he paid $118 million for a new 175,000-square-foot headquarters for his fashion business. Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour and massively valuable music catalog propelled her into the three-comma club last October. Since then she’s released her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and continued her blockbuster Eras Tour. Kim K might be famous for being famous, but she is a billionaire from Skims, her shapewear brand that raised $270 million at a $4 billion valuation in 2023. She also has a skincare line, SKKN BY KIM, and a private equity firm, SKKY Partners. Crowned the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022 before falling from the ranks amid market turmoil, Wang regained the title in May after announcing that his artificial intelligence unicorn Scale AI had raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation. Wang owns an estimated 15% of the San Francisco-based firm. Ford sold his stake in his eponymous fashion brand to Estee Lauder in 2022 in a $2.8 billion deal. Since then, he’s put a big chunk of that fortune into an impressive real estate portfolio worth an estimated $200 million. The wunderkind sold his virtual reality company, Oculus VR, to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014, at age 21. His latest venture: Anduril Industries, a defense firm that was valued by private investors at $8.5 billion in 2022. Though best known for his music, Shawn Carter made much of his fortune in alcohol. He sold a 50% stake in his champagne empire Armand de Brignac to LVMH in 2021, then sold the majority of his cognac brand D’Usse to Barcardi in 2023. Winfrey dropped off The Forbes 400 in 2021 and hasn’t made it back, though she’s still one of America’s richest self-made women, thanks to the reinvested profits from her show and films.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America

Itwas another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months—some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars. In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400. This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500’s 27% return. Much of the gains come from two people: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They’re two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits. Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer’s rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11. Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year. Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list: One of Sam Walton’s eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family’s third generation still sit on Walmart’s board: Jim’s son Steuart Walton (Lukas’ first cousin) and Rob’s son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman. “On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,” Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, “we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win.” His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023. Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump’s reelection bid. Griffin’s hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France. In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he’s backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024. In August, their Mars Inc. announced it’s gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg’s) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M’s and Kind bars. It’s the company’s biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations. Yass’ fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group—and Yass’ share of profits—based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna’s estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass). In August, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father’s 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA’s New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Rob Walton retired from Walmart’s board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings’ estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart’s “Every Day Low Price” strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family’s $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world’s wealthiest woman in early September from L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022. Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family’s charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell’s net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively. Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer—a phenomenon termed “Jensanity.” Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since. The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges. The Microsoft cofounder’s rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he’s set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple’s Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy. “Damn, I’m fired up!” exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers’ new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion. Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51 A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin’s Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet’s sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google’s continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months. More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America’s first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett—the nation’s greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving—donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed. It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm’s shares up 12% to record highs. He’s spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion–plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David’s media production company. No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He’s $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness. Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami’s “billionaire bunker” island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year. Tesla’s self-proclaimed “technoking” tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024. It’s a record-smashing year for America’s 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023. In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people—a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more—are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list’s total net worth. The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she’s worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year. As a group, the list’s women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built—rather than inherited—their fortune. Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare—just 25 out of the 400. Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane’s fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike’s Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir. Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career. These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation’s richest people. Among this year’s 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires. They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion). The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company’s David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101. The richest Americans’ net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people—2.5% of the list—have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5.

Title: Five Stocks to Watch in October—and What to Watch For

The major indexes are trading near record highs after the Fed's rate cut fueled a rebound from a shaky start to September. Looking ahead at specific companies, October brings a major product launch from one of the Magnificent Seven and earnings reports from key companies in the tech, banking, and apparel industries. Below, we look at five stocks that could lead market trends—and see big price movements—in October. Tesla (TSLA) will kick off October with third-quarter delivery data early in the month. But investors may watch another event even more closely: a robotaxi launch scheduled for Oct. 10. The event, which CEO Elon Musk has said will be the most important moment for Tesla since it unveiled the Model 3 in 2016, will likely feature a prototype of the robotaxi model, dubbed “Cybercab.” It will also be an opportunity for the automaker to showcase its investments in artificial intelligence and its progress on full self-driving (FSD) software. Analysts have speculated that Tesla stock could get a lift if the company offers aggressive estimates of how quickly it can roll out robotaxis, the size of the market, or its timeline for achieving unsupervised FSD. Tesla stock has risen about 5% so far this year. Microsoft (MSFT) could set the tone for big tech earnings this quarter when it reports mid-month. While the company announced a date just yet, some market watchers expect that its earnings will drop after the bell on Oct. 22, the same day Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) is expected to report. Microsoft is one of four trillion-dollar tech companies—including Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—engaged in an expensive artificial intelligence arms race. Microsoft spent nearly $14 billion on property and equipment in the quarter ended June 30, a 55% increase from the same year-ago period. Much of that spending was on the chips, servers, and other equipment needed to run the company’s AI-powering data centers. Big Tech's spending spooked some corners of Wall Street, which fueled a string of dramatic tech sell-offs in July. Chatter about AI spending has since abated, but Microsoft and its big tech peers have, unlike the broader market, yet to fully rebound from their summer slump. (Still, Microsoft shares are up 14% this year.) Microsoft’s upcoming report has the potential to recast the spotlight on big tech’s spending or give Wall Street a taste of the payoff the company has assured them is coming. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest non-state-owned bank, could give investors a glimpse of what Fed rate cuts mean for American banks when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 11. JPMorgan shares tanked in early September after one executive warned that net interest income (NII), the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, was likely to be lower in 2025 than previously forecast. That warning came just days before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which it is expected to follow up with a string of cuts stretching into next year. Lower interest rates will weigh on JPMorgan’s NII, but they will also take some of the pressure off borrowers who otherwise might have defaulted on loans. Bank of America analysts think banks are better prepared to weather this rate-cutting cycle than any in recent memory. Plus, lower rates in the context of a soft landing—an outcome some economists say is looking increasingly likely—should spur loan demand, reinvigorate mortgage lending, and boost trading activity, all bonuses for banks. The analysts, though, conceded that it's easier to calculate how much rate cuts will reduce NII than how much they’ll boost revenue. JPMorgan’s quarterly results could shed some light on that trade-off and move the stock, which is up 24% since the start of the year. Nike (NKE) will report results for the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Oct. 1. and it will be the shoe retailer’s last report before incoming CEO Elliott Hill takes the reins on Oct. 14. The CEO transition marks the beginning of a new phase of Nike’s turnaround efforts. The company has been struggling for some time with sluggish sales in China, once considered its largest growth opportunity, and loss of market share to upstart rivals like On (ONON) and Deckers-owned (DECK) Hoka. Nike shares had their worst day on record after its most recent earnings report in June when the company forecast sales would decline by 10% in the fiscal first quarter. The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.

On Tuesday, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) stock received a Buy rating from Pivotal Research, with a new price target set at $780. The research firm highlighted Meta's status as the leading social media company worldwide, citing its substantial daily active user base of 3.3 billion across its platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Reels, Stories, and Facebook Messenger. Pivotal Research commended Meta's management for its proven track record in developing new products and enhancements, particularly in response to competitors. The firm anticipates robust revenue growth for Meta, driven by increased usage, the introduction of new products, improved targeting, and higher pricing. This growth is expected to be further supported by cost efficiencies gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. The research firm's outlook for Meta is bolstered by what it considers an attractive valuation. Meta's earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 are valued at approximately 24 times, and when factoring out 90% of Reality Labs' losses, the valuation is closer to 19 times EPS. Pivotal Research expressed confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ability to steer Meta successfully in an ever-evolving world propelled by rapid advancements in AI. The endorsement from Pivotal Research underscores Meta's potential for increased profitability and market dominance. With its array of popular social media platforms and ongoing innovations, Meta appears well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI and the digital landscape. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has been a focal point of several analyst updates and regulatory news. Monness, Crespi, Hardt raised Meta's 12-month price target to $620, maintaining a Buy rating due to the company's AI and metaverse potential. Rosenblatt Securities also increased its price target for Meta to $811, citing strength in AI and VR/AR. Meanwhile, Meta was hit with a €91 million fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating on Meta following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Stifel reiterated a Buy rating on Meta, expressing confidence in the company's AI focus. These are among the recent developments in Meta's business landscape. As a reminder, this article reports on recent news and does not make any predictions or personal opinions. The information provided is based on past articles and is intended to offer a snapshot of recent events involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' strong market position, as highlighted by Pivotal Research, is further supported by recent financial data and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.45 trillion, reflecting its dominant status in the social media landscape. InvestingPro data reveals that Meta's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $149.78 billion, with a robust revenue growth of 24.28% over the same period. This aligns with Pivotal Research's expectations of strong revenue growth driven by increased usage and new product introductions. The company's financial health is underscored by two key InvestingPro Tips. Firstly, Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a strong financial position. Secondly, it boasts "impressive gross profit margins," with the latest data showing a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These factors contribute to Meta's ability to invest in innovation and AI advancements, as noted in the Pivotal Research analysis. Meta's valuation metrics also support the research firm's outlook. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) stands at 26.86, which, when considered alongside its growth prospects, suggests a potentially attractive valuation. This is further reinforced by an InvestingPro Tip stating that Meta is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips on Meta Platforms, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta’s Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma’s mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future — and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Technology Heidi Klum Brings Her New Game Modelverse to Roblox Wellness Oura's Sleekest and Most Efficient Health-tracking Ring Has Arrived Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban’s bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking — so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them — as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress — as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta’s Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype — which isn’t Meta’s first, but it’s the first to be showcased publicly — the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. “So with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence — like you were right there with another person,” Zuckerberg explained. “This is where we are going.” The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg’s “One more thing” moment, echoing Steve Jobs’ penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a “buy” rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. “We call this Hyperscape,” said Zuckerberg, “and the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.” He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham’s studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual Döppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot — perhaps a döppelbot — that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. “Meta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you’re going to,” said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language — Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta’s Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta’s Puma collaboration wasn’t part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta’s Web Platform Team teased “the future of e-commerce” through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset’s camera pass-through view. But it’s not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item’s color, and “experience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,” according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There’s a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset’s live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there’s nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. “A lot of the stuff we’ve been talking about for a long time … glasses, mixed reality, AI — it’s happening,” Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. “And you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it’s pretty awesome.” Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There’s no ship date or retail price announced yet — again, because it’s a prototype — but it will likely top the rival device’s $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it “impressive,” given that “most other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,” he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is “several years (and tens of billions) away from general release.” In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

Title: DoubleVerify stock hits 52-week low at $16.8 amid market challenges

In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year — Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) — none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. “With the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,” JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. “The political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,” he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. © 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault—and the raft of plush brands he oversees—seem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault’s fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business’s stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH’s share price bounced 14% from €617.50 to €703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault’s fortunes—after all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion—leapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world’s richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini—the CEO of Moncler—and one of the brand’s largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH’s influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: “The luxury consumer is all shopped out.” It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ position—the same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. “‘Quiet luxury’ has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,” the group wrote. “The industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at €1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).” And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/metas-swot-analysis-aidriven-growth-fuels-stock-optimism-93CH-3638852

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Fortune Swells To Over $200 Billion—The Metaverse Masterstroke

Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:00:26Z

The trek into the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg has been anything but smooth. His once-risky bet, which cost him more than $100 billion, appears to be paying off handsomely now. His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge. Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk. Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it. Some doubters think Meta’s performance produced more loses than advantages. Some critics have argued that Zuckerberg’s fortune has been less in the metaverse concept itself than in his endeavors to benefit from recent AI leaps. Interestingly, Meta made huge financial stabilization efforts. This includes the initiation of its $50 billion share buyback program and also reduced 25% of its workforce for the sake of streamlining the organization. Zuckerberg continued to support the metaverse despite financial issues. He passionately discussed integrating the actual and virtual worlds at recent events, envisioning a period when people communicate via holograms or avatars. Nonetheless, a few shareholders and insiders are advising caution. They’ve voiced reservations about investing further funds in what many consider to be a project that is still a long way from becoming widely accepted. Furthermore, there’s a growing belief that Zuckerberg ought to focus on Meta’s main applications, which generate almost all of the company’s income: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As the tech sector gets more competitive—especially with rivals like Google and Amazon making major advances in artificial intelligence— Zuckerberg might wish to rethink his goals. As Meta continues to introduce fresh goods, such as the Quest 3 VR helmet and Ray-Ban smart glasses, these innovations should eventually help the business to increase its income. Still, many investors who would rather see gains sooner rather than later harbor great skepticism. Future prosperity of the company will depend critically on its capacity to include fresh technologies into its current systems.

By David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 54, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) This week, I’ve been reading about AI slop and sports betting and Jony Ive, clearing my schedule for the new season of The Great British Bake Off, watching Sicario and Pirates of the Caribbean and A Quiet Place: Day One on plane-seat screens like their directors intended, insta-subscribing to Hasan Minhaj’s new YouTube show, and just relentlessly trolling people with Vergecast clips through Pocket Casts’ new feature. I also have for you a couple of new Meta gadgets, the mobile game that will eat up all your free time, a couple of hotly anticipated new movies, the best Spotify feature in forever, and much more. So much going on! Let’s dig in. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be reading / watching / playing / trying / building out of clay this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.) / A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. Fun fact: Joanna Stern is the main reason I ever got a job at The Verge in the first place. (That story is long and, if I remember correctly, involves her playing a fairy in a video? But I promised her I wouldn’t tell that story.) These days, she’s a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, an Emmy winner, and most recently, the creator of Joannabot, the AI chatbot that will tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 16. (And apparently also do some other things, if you’re clever enough, but again, we’ll leave that alone.) I asked Joanna to share her homescreen because she just reviewed the iPhone 16, which means she just had to set up a homescreen. And because she’s forever using new gadgets and switching between things, I was curious what always made it to the top of the pile. Here’s Joanna’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: I’m submitting my homescreen and my Control Center screen because I’m proud of the work I did on the Control Center. I may submit it for an award. But really, I’d like to just use this as a forum to complain about the all-in-one connectivity widget in the new Control Center in iOS 18. I don’t like it. I like the single buttons so I can easily just turn them on and off or long-press to get in there. Sadly, they have gotten rid of the single Wi-Fi button, but I read on this great website that it’s coming back in iOS 18.1. The phone: iPhone 16 Pro Max. The wallpaper: This is my dog Browser. It isn’t the best shot of him, but the framing is nice for putting him in the middle of the screen. My lockscreen wallpaper is this awesome retro iPod made by a designer named Shane Levine. I bought it through this site last year after featuring it in my newsletter. The apps: WSJ, ChatGPT, Apple Notes, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Instagram, YouTube, Clock, Threads, Signal, Photos, Slack, Spotify, Phone, Safari, Messages, Gmail. My apps are so basic and make me feel so basic. I work (Slack, Gmail). I message (Messages, Signal). I listen and watch things (YouTube, Spotify). I social media (Threads, Instagram). I work more (Google Docs, WSJ). If it isn’t on this main homescreen, I usually just search for it. Before iOS 18, I had a widget stack on the homescreen with weather and time zone widgets, but I moved it off to another screen. I might move it back. I might not. Got to live a little. I also asked Joanna to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she shared: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. And for even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. “Sliding Seas. It’s a match-three (or four!) game but also so much more: there’s real strategy required behind your moves to beat levels at the higher end, but it’s never unfair, and while there are in-app purchases and power-ups you can buy to make a level easier, you crucially never need to. It is the most compelling and well-suited-to-mobile game I’ve ever found and a gem I recommend without reservation.” – Jamie “Gisnep is another daily puzzle game, this time by David Friedman of Ironic Sans. It appears as a crossword-esque grid, but the words only go across and wrap around. The goal is to reveal both a quote and the source by filling in letters from vertical columns. I’ve gotten a number of my friends hooked already.” – Kyle “Satisfactory 1.0 launched a week ago or so. A great group of devs have effectively made a game that feels like work but is fun. If you love conveyor belts and staying up all night, this might be for you.” – Matt “Can’t believe you haven’t mentioned switching to OmniFocus! As a fellow perennial ‘task manager switcher,’ this app is a staple in my rotation.” – Pedro “I previously recommended App in the Air as a great travel companion, but unfortunately, it’s shutting down. If you’re looking for an alternative, Flighty is excellent, especially for travel stats, and they’re building an importer for App in the Air users.” – Vivian “We’ve been watching English Teacher on FX. Constant laughs and, so far, each episode has been better than the last. Easily one of the funniest shows on TV right now.” – Danial “I was gifted the Humanscale FR300 Ergonomic Foot Rocker, which is a very tech-sounding name for a very manual / mechanical rocking footrest. It’s very pleasant to use. I’ve also been standing on it sometimes... which I’m not sure is safe but sure is fun!” – Wisdom “Repeatedly putting in my Amazon cart the Black Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I was so close to buying it like three times. Now it’s out of stock. Even Apple says early November for shipping.” – Scott “Been playing with different LLMs using LM Studio. Integrated it into my Obsidian vault to help summarize and organize things into specific formats. It’s been extremely cool!” – Cody I’ve had back-to-back-to-back-to-back trips over the last two weeks, and I would just like to quickly shout out my new No. 1 travel hack: a wall charger that doubles as a big-ass portable battery. I have this Anker model, which is $55, charges a USB-C and a USB-A device simultaneously, and also charges itself so I can get 10,000mAh of power when there’s no outlet nearby. (There’s also a newer one with two USB-C ports and even faster charging but less battery capacity.) It’s huge and heavy, but this thing and a long cable are now the only charging gear I travel with, and they’re the only reasons my gadgets have survived trains and plane rides. Here at Installer, we love a sensible charging strategy, and this is as sensible as it gets.

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology’s superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner’s cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, “It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.” In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn’t an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn’t feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! D.A. Davidson analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from a Buy to a Neutral rating on Monday, maintaining their $475 price target. The firm pointed to increasing competition in AI as the reason for the revision, noting that rivals have largely caught up to Microsoft’s AI capabilities. This, they argue, "reduces the justification for the current premium valuation." Microsoft’s stock has soared by 92% since January 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which gained 49% over the same period. But now, D.A. Davidson analysts believe that Microsoft's lead in cloud and AI is narrowing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP) have demonstrated similar growth rates, which has closed the gap in cloud business expansion. “Our new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in terms of deploying their own silicon into their data centers, which gives them a significant advantage over Azure going forward,” they said in a note. Microsoft’s Maia chips are still behind Amazon and Google by several years, with their current use limited to Azure OpenAI Services workloads. This, according to D.A. Davidson, places Microsoft in a challenging position in the competitive data center landscape. Another concern raised by the analysts is Microsoft’s reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for data center operations, which could lead to a shift of value from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia’s. Microsoft’s operating margins are under pressure due to rising data center capital expenditures, which have jumped from 12% to 21% of revenue. “This is a higher rate of increase compared to Amazon and Google, a result of Microsoft’s greater reliance on NVIDIA,” analysts continued. “Every year Microsoft over-invests at these rates, it will diminish margins by at least 1pp in a cumulative manner. Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment in order to offset the margin drag.” Also, the firm expressed concerns about the sustainability of Azure’s revenue growth, hinting that it could be inflated by contributions from OpenAI's self-funded revenue. This week, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) kicked off its developer-focused event, Meta Connect, unveiling its latest hardware and software innovations. One of the key highlights was the launch of the Quest 3S, the newest virtual reality (VR) headset from Meta's Reality Labs division, offered at a more affordable price than its predecessor. Also, Meta introduced a new prototype of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses and revealed updates to its Meta AI chatbot. The chatbot now includes a voice interaction feature, allowing users to engage through both spoken and written commands. Here’s what analysts said after the event: Citi: “Meta’s new AI products, features, and devices announced at Connect ‘24 make us incrementally confident that its product innovation can deliver increased engagement and monetization as the ROI from its AI investments continues to expand.” Bank of America: “We think AI Glasses have much broader market potential than VR Googles. While Metaverse spend still seems hard to justify, with glasses long-term investors may have some renewed optimism on Meta’s opportunity to be at the forefront of the next generation of personal computing devices. “More importantly, the company appears to be successfully innovating around new AI capabilities, driving usage growth which can offset terminal value concerns, and we see Meta as the top AI pick in consumer Internet.” JMP Securities analysts said earlier this week that Google's enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by increased use of its Gemini platform. "We are seeing signs that enterprise adoption of AI is inflecting." At Google's "Gemini at Work" event, the tech giant highlighted a 35x surge in Gemini platform usage, with 75% of daily users reporting improvements in work quality due to AI. JMP Securities views this as a clear signal of a turning point in enterprise AI adoption. The firm credits Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for removing barriers to AI adoption by achieving compliance with key standards like SOC 1, 2, 3, and HIPAA, and forging integration partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). These efforts have resulted in 85 new enterprise use cases over the past six months, driving meaningful cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for businesses. JMP Securities also stressed the growing importance of AI as corporations focus on technological transformation. Google’s integration of AI solutions with both first- and third-party data is improving accuracy and functionality, further boosting enterprise AI usage. The firm noted that generative AI usage by enterprises has surged 15x, while adoption of AI agents has grown by 6x. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) saw its shares jump nearly 15% on Thursday after delivering an optimistic first-quarter revenue outlook, driven by strong demand and pricing for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial to the rapidly expanding generative AI sector. The chipmaker, a key supplier to Nvidia, added approximately $15 billion to its market capitalization as its stock surged around 27% over the past three weeks. “It’s really not a good day to be short memory and semi-cap equipment stocks,” a Mizuho analyst remarked after the report’s release and Micron’s stock jump. “For the memory and semi cap equipment bears, I would advise against going down in a ball of flames and cover shorts and consider getting long some key semi winners even if you dislike MU and not willing to chase this 15%+ rip at the open,” the analyst added. “Personally, I think the MU rally will sustain and pull in many of these long/short haters who will flip from short to long at least for the near term.” Micron is shifting its focus away from lower-margin segments like PCs and smartphones to higher-margin, high-value products, such as HBM chips for servers and data centers. Mizuho highlighted that Micron management is confident their technology leads in both power and performance, outperforming competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung (KS:005930). Following Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) latest earnings report published this week, Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, raising the price target to $395 from $329. Despite Accenture's overall FY25 guidance meeting expectations, analysts are optimistic about several underlying metrics. The company's first-quarter forecast exceeded consensus, with strong bookings of $20.2 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x. moreover, Accenture’s workforce expanded significantly, adding 24,000 employees, marking a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter increase. “The setup for FY25 seems attractive as full-year guidance assumes no improvement beyond 1Q,” analysts wrote. One of the key growth drivers was in Generative AI (GenAI), where bookings and revenues grew approximately tenfold. In FY24, GenAI bookings hit $3 billion, with revenues of $900 million, up from $300 million and $100 million, respectively. “Importantly, the company is starting to see some scaled GenAI projects; and an increase in the number of data projects and security-related work ($9B in revenues, +23% growth),” Piper Sandler’s team noted. “Overall, we believe owning ACN is attractive, given improving top-line metrics, a conservative guide, and that it is a key beneficiary of GenAI-related work.”
