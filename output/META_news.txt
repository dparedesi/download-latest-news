Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) has faced criticism for investing too heavily in the Metaverse, but the company’s broader business has continued to perform well. During a recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast, 24/7 Analysts Eric Bleeker and Austin Smith discussed whether the announced cutbacks on the Metaverse could help generate even greater returns for Meta in 2026. The recent announcement that Meta will be acquiring the AI wearable company Limitless has signaled to many a strategic shift toward AI-focused opportunities. Some believe that if Meta executes well, shares could rise toward $900, potentially even $1,000 per share. “I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets,” Smith explained. “That’s what you get with a founder, CEO, who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out.” Bleeker added, “If you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline.” If the video embed isn’t working, you can access the full video at the following URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/14/meta-meta-stock-pops-following-metaverse-cuts-announcement-could-it-hit-1000-in-2026 This conversation was from our most recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast.

If you’re a Meta investors, getting the full story on the biggest developments in AI is absolutely essential, so don’t delay! Austin Smith: Meta has had its own anchor. Now that’s weird to say for a company whose shares have performed as well as they have, and Meta’s a bigger company than the Metaverse. But when you think about the one big criticism that people have had of Meta in the last few years, it’s been why is Mark Zuckerberg flushing so much money down the metaverse drain? Nobody believes in it. The traction has been really low. So Meta has a lot more going for it than that, and that’s been enough to overwhelm that one core criticism. But that has been the biggest criticism I’ve heard, and frankly, it’s a criticism I share. I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets. That’s what you get with a founder CEO who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out. So Meta finally announcing that they’re cutting some of the revenue out of that division. Wall Street rewarded it. I think they should. That’s the right call. Anything you saw in this that’s interesting? Just cutting out from that tiny anchor and saying, “Hey, Metaverse, this capital has a higher return for the company and a shorter path to revenue: AI,” right? AI internally, AI externally, it’s clearly a better place to deploy that money. Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Well, if we are doing Glengarry Glen Ross, you know, what is it? The winner gets a car. The second place gets steak knives and last gets fired. If you looked at the Magnificent Seven this year, Google is the car, NVIDIA gets the steak knives. Google’s up 70%, NVIDIA’s up 35%. And then the laggards are some combination of Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon – up zero to 15% – all slightly underperforming the S&P. Meta has been disappointing, especially from where we purchased it. I have wanted to move out of the portfolio. The problem is, if you go back and look at Meta’s stock the past two years, it’s a very tight range. They’re trading between 20 and 30 times forward earnings. And right now, they’re at the bottom of that valuation. It’s because the market doesn’t believe in them specifically. They were sold off very harshly because of how high their operating costs are rising last quarter. We’ve got two sides to Meta. One is that AI has more potential to drive their business than any other company. I believe there’s a study that generative AI leads to 19% better click-through rates on ads, which is going to make their products better. They’re going to be able to create new products. We know the ROI. But if they’re spending so much in this rush for ASI and they’re behind in those efforts, investors aren’t going to believe in that narrative. So I’ve wanted to see them rise to higher, closer to that 30 times forward earnings multiple, like Google’s closer to right now, before I sell it off and redeploy that cash. This is a great step in that direction. They need to be cutting some costs. They need to show the market they have discipline. And we saw the day they announced this, they were up 4%. So if you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline. We’ll see where they trade, which depends a lot on how they handle this cost discipline throughout the year. Austin Smith: It’s interesting to talk about cost discipline in a world where Meta is also being punished for spending so much on AI. But this is what cost discipline is, right? If they believe in AI and the ROI on Metaverse isn’t there, they need to cut in one category and move that money to the other. And they’re doing that. Just yesterday, Meta announced they’re acquiring an AI wearable company, Limitless. It’s not a big acquisition in terms of total dollars, but it shows that they are reducing the thing that’s not working and putting more money in the thing that is working, which is AI. That is good financial discipline. Whether or not the AI bets pay off is the next Meta question that Wall Street has, but at least they are not sticking poorly with the Metaverse bet.

By The Knowledge Project Podcast ## Key takeaways - **Doorman Fallacy**: Management consultants replace a doorman costing $X with an automatic door, saving money short-term, but the hotel's reputation crashes because the doorman provided security, taxi hailing, guest recognition, and status—value not captured in 'open the door' metrics. [04:43], [05:29] - **Postman Brand Perception**: Royal Mail found brand affection uncorrelated with service reliability; it depended on liking the postman, who built trust through chats and favors, outweighing metrics like delivery speed. [07:26], [08:15] - **Cold Beer Transaction Utility**: Thaler’s experiment shows people pay more for identical cold beer from a boutique hotel than a shack due to transaction utility—how good the deal feels—independent of the beer's utility. [18:11], [19:30] - **Dyson Call Center Honor**: James Dyson halted efficiency metrics presentation, insisting calls be treated as an honor; staff solved problems helpfully, even free parts next day, building fanatical loyalty despite premium prices. [40:47], [41:20] - **Family Firms Outperform PLCs**: Privately-owned family firms like McCain, Yorkshire Tea, and Dyson dominate advertising effectiveness awards over PLCs, prioritizing long-term customer value over short-term shareholder transactions. [28:28], [32:23] - **Psychopath Detection Test**: Women arrive late on first dates as a test; psychopaths rage while normals say 'traffic was terrible,' revealing character since we evolved to judge trustworthiness over half a million years. [20:43], [22:04] I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with a perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-m along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising. It's marketing and it's advertising. It's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And do you think we're marketing. And do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? >> We usually do. And so, you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. >> What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? >> I think a large part of it comes down to So, we first we were talking about this in the elevator. It was nine years ago. She back when podcasting wasn't even a thing. >> We must be able to dig out the original content presumably. Yeah. content presumably. Yeah. >> What was it? It was your podcast number 47 or something, was it? >> Oh, no. I think it was like 16 or something. Really? It was really low. something. Really? It was really low. We'll have to dig out the number, but uh it's been a long time since then. >> Oh, fabulous. Yeah. >> And and podcasting has exploded. I've been following Farum Street devotedly. >> Appreciate that. Um and uh it's always always interesting very very interesting on and I mean the whole question of the decision sciences uh is I think at the moment completely critical and actually by the way it'll be very very interesting with AI because I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with the perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that at the very least you'll have to show them three or four or five skiing holidays from which they choose because we can't really choose in the absence of comparison. It's what do you see what I mean? It's a sort of freakish element of free market capitalism which is we can only like something if we choose it in preference to something else. >> That's interesting. How does that relate to like a travel agency which would do that inherently? Like if you said I'm that inherently? Like if you said I'm going to India to chat GPT and you're like plan it for me versus you go to a travel agency and you're like I'm going to India plan it for me. Well among real estate agents there's apparently a kind of little bit of a trick which is you always in before you show someone the house you want to sell them. You show them a less appropriate house, ideally that's slightly more expensive, say, so that when they see the house that you want to sell them, it's now clearcut because they can say, "Ooh, it's a bit cheaper than the other one and it's got a conservatory." a conservatory." >> There's contrast. >> So there's a kind of decoy effect, a bit like the famous economist experiment with a decoy effect. So, you know, well, you know, one of my interesting questions is, you know, what interface will AI deploy to help us make choices and will it make the mistake that you could very easily make? If you think about it, nobody clicked the I'm feeling lucky button on Google. I think it's still there, isn't it? It's been there for years and they've removed it and found that it slightly reduces the appeal, but the number of people who actually click it, i.e., I'm feeling lucky, take me straight to a single page, is vanishingly small. people want to choose between, you know, effectively above the fold options. And um so, you know, I'm just intrigued because it's very very easy, I think, for people with an economic or tech background to make assumptions about what people are trying to do and how they choose and that we're, you know, utility maximizers and all this kind of thing only really to be completely wrong. Do you think we're looking for wrong. Do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? We usually do uh in the sense that when you pursue efficiency there are quite a few problems. But when you pursue efficiency generally you start looking at numerical or mechanical factors and of course in the process you disregard psychological factors where the greater gains may be found and so you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. I mean, one of the greatest creation. I mean, one of the greatest forms of efficiency, by the way, is employing a human being who's really, really nice. Now, this is complete really nice. Now, this is complete anathema to people in tech who love to define business processes so as to make them susceptible to automation. You know, person X does this. We will take that function, we will replace it with algorithm Y. And it's a very beguiling message because it usually comes with cost savings attached. You might have heard savings attached. You might have heard of my thing, the Dorman fallacy. Did you >> remind >> I'll remind the viewers and listeners uh which is simply that you know you you have a hotel it's a five-star hotel it has a dormant someone who welcomes incoming guests you know a combination of say McKenzie or Accenture and a tech firm will come in and say your dorman currently costs you $X,000 a year we have defined his or her function as opening the door we will replace said dorman with automatic door opening mechanism and an infrared human detector and we'll save you 30 $40,000 a year and then they walk away. They take the credit for the costsaving and then two years later, you know, the hotel's a catastrophe. The rack rates fallen off a cliff because the dorman was doing multiple things, many of which were human and kind of tacit. Security would be one. You know, there are no vagrants to sleep in the doorway, hailing taxis, dealing with luggage, recognizing regular guests, providing status to the hotel. There are loads and loads of value creation components to that dorman which aren't captured in the open the door definition. >> Is that an example of where the costs are really visible, but the benefits are >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very easy management consulting firms uh if you if you're in a business and and some management consultants come in go to the management and say are they on a gain share agreement. A gain share agreement share agreement. A gain share agreement is a management consulting scam where you claim uh a certain percentage of the cost savings you identify in year one. Now as Roger L. Martin, your fellow Canadian and my own personal Svengali says, "Any idiot can cut costs." Okay. What takes real skill is cutting cost in a way that doesn't destroy value. One of the things that I don't think is understood by tech nerds and if I'm being really cruel, you know, males in general in in many cases is the extent to which in evaluating any business or experience, the human component of it, the face-to-face component does really really heavy lifting. And I've got a lovely story to illustrate this which I think is fantastic. It's the absolute perfect example of misalignment of optimization through quantification bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor used to be the marketing director of Royal Mail, but you know similar to what you have with Canada Post, right? USPS. >> Mhm. Sorry, not US. Yes, just USPS. And they couldn't make any sense of the fact that the brand perception of Royal Mail bore no relation to service levels. So there would be districts and areas where you know every single firstass letter arrived early the following day extraordinarily reliable levels of service and royal mail wasn't particularly held in affection or esteem. There were other areas where the esteem. There were other areas where the service was frankly a bit ropey and people seemed to love it. Now, this obviously upset them because they thought that all the billions or certainly hundreds of millions they'd invested in service quality improvement should translate into customer satisfaction and therefore, you know, some sort of brand voltage. And someone had a theory and they said, I think something else is going on. And the theory which was put to the test and proved absolutely right was that the major determinant of whether you liked royal male or not was whether you liked your postman or posty technically to be used the genderneutral term. >> So people who had a rather unreliable service but the postman did the odd favor for them left things in the porch had a chat with them. Okay, those people thought it was a brilliant organization regardless of the actual metrics that were being pursued. And I think that's very true in uh any service organization. You know, you may there's organization. You know, you may there's an electricity company, a gas company, a water company, a utility. You may interact with them online 95% of the time, but the one or two occasions where you interact by telephone or face to face disproportionately affect your your perception of the organization. And I've argued for quite a time if I were being completely honest, I've worked in advertising for 36 years. And if I were a wholly honest person, uh, without, you know, fear of annoying my colleagues, probably 50% of the time, I would advise to a client, take 10 to 20% of your marketing budget and spend it on upgrading the call center. Pay the people too much. Get the best practitioners. I think it's perfectly practitioners. I think it's perfectly legitimate. In some organizations, there legitimate. In some organizations, there should be the very best call center people should be on six figures because it makes if you're good and nice, that's how much difference it makes. In other words, it more or less makes. In other words, it more or less drowns out all your other stuff, all the other noise. If every time you have a other noise. If every time you have a personal experience, you have a good experience, then broadly speaking in the human brain, uh that's a good organization which I can trust. And when you think about it, I suddenly realize why this probably is. We don't really have much evolved experience in evaluating postal efficiency, do we? Okay, we have quart of a million half a million years of evolved experience in deciding who to like and trust because for most of our evolutionary, you know, existence, that was one of the most fi five most important questions to get right. You know, do I trust this person? right. You know, do I trust this person? You know, will they attack me? Are they an ally? Are they a foe? Uh if I pay them money, will they deliver? And so consequently, I think what we do in our brains is we use our human judgment as a proxy. >> Now, a story to back up that, you probably remember this, okay? It's in my book, Alchemy, which is imagine you're turning up to buy a secondhand car and you turn up at the house, nondescript house, and the car is parked outside the house and you have a look at the car and you judge the, you know, whether the pedals are worn and the condition of the body work, and you have a look around the car. and you decide you're interested in paying, let's say, $5,000 for this car. So, you go and ring on the doorbell of the vendor and the door is answered in one situation by, for example, a female vicar. Okay? Could be Catholic. Well, they can't be Catholic, but you know, Episcopalian, doesn't really matter. Okay? Female vicar. And it's a tidy clean house. At that point, you probably upweight what you're prepared to pay by 20% or so. In in a parallel universe, the door so. In in a parallel universe, the door is answered by a guy in his underpants. In other words, someone with no shame. >> In that instance, you devalue the car, I suspect, by about $1,000 or more. In fact, you may not even buy it at all. And what we're doing here is we're effectively saying, what I'm going to do is a standin for the question, do I buy the car, which I don't have the technical knowledge to answer. I'm going to ask a supplementary heruristic question which is do I trust the person who's selling the car to me? >> And it's an interesting question. You my mother didn't know anything about cars, knew a lot about people. I think she would very reliably go around buying cars just through her assessment of the seller. And similarly, I think she might do better than someone with an engineering qualification who ignored who the seller was and their personality and character. Now, as a bit of evidence of this, I discovered because I've been investigating this, uh, various real estate agents have said to me that every estate agent does their utmost to make sure that until things are signed and sealed, the vendor never meets the buyer and vice versa. And the reason for that is if one of them doesn't like the other, they won't buy or sell. Now, when you think about it, that's completely unless the person's moving next door. Obviously, if you're buying a next door. Obviously, if you're buying a house from someone who's planning to move next door and they turn out to be a psycho, that's relevant information. But it seems to be the case that if you meet the the vendor and you basically don't trust them or think they're a bit shifty, it doesn't matter what the price is. It doesn't matter the condition of is. It doesn't matter the condition of the house. Suddenly, you revise your the house. Suddenly, you revise your valuation of the house downwards if you don't like the person selling it to you. And so that's one of the reasons why apparently uh real estate agents will leave any kind of contact between the two uh until after at least a survey has been done and enough commitments taken place. I once by the way I once didn't place. I once by the way I once didn't buy a house basically because the guy was being an about the fridge. Now the fridge was only worth uh you know I think 0.2% 2% uh of the value of the house or 0.02% of the value of the house. I can't quite remember. But because he was being a remember. But because he was being a dick about the fridge, I no longer trusted him about the house. >> Yeah. >> Weirdly, it turned out my instinct was right because then a friend of ours went to buy the same house. They got some separate land registry search done and found out that a chunk of the garden actually belonged to Network Rail, not to the house. It effectively filed a large part of the garden. So does that mean I just want to garden. So does that mean I just want to go back to the the real estate thing for a second. Does that mean a second. Does that mean pretty or attractive real estate agents would be more successful than >> It's a really interesting question which is I think we you know I think we ought to study these things much more because the assumption of an economist is that you need to disintermediate >> you don't need estate agents we just go on willow Zillow sorry or right move in the UK or whatever it is what's the Canadian equivalent >> I don't even know >> cababins.com or whatever okay.com Yeah, we go. Exactly. You go on one of those things. You choose the house you those things. You choose the house you want. You look at it. You then look at want. You look at it. You then look at the house, get a survey done, buy the house. We assume that there is, you house. We assume that there is, you know, this is a purely transactional exchange. Maybe in a rational world, that's exactly what it would be. >> But for one thing, actually, someone who's invested 15 years in doing up a house probably cares about what the person buying it is going to do to the house. So, my parents-in-law, for example, are fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into this. Seriously, get into something like this. Seriously, get into something like crack. >> We have no worry that I'm going to >> No worry you're going to become an enthusiastic. >> Can barely keep a plant alive. >> Good, good, good. Okay. Um, but I guarantee if you went and looked around their house and placed an offer while being an expert in botany and generally quoting people like Gertude Jel and, you know, prominent garden designers and Sissinghurst and Da uh you could you could buy their house for 200,000 less than if you turned up and said, "Brilliant, we can knock down that tree and put in a helipad." Yeah. >> You know, I think if you said, "We can knock down that tree and put in a carting track." Right. I don't think carting track." Right. I don't think they'd sell it to you at any price. >> If you're a founder, you know naming your startup takes forever. You finally land on the perfect name only to find out that Peter from Delaware got to the first. So, you're stuck with two bad first. So, you're stuck with two bad options. Pay up and fund Peter's options. Pay up and fund Peter's retirement or tack on random words until your domain looks like a Wi-Fi password.

Richard Thaylor did I think his most interesting work of all is actually on the concept of transaction utility which you may remember do you remember this >> a little bit >> yeah it's in I think it's in nudge and the famous thought experiment is this which I find fascinating and I think it's a really insightful thought experiment so the idea is you and your best friend are lying on a beach somewhere and it's hot and you're very thirsty and about quarter of a mile down the beach there's a place that sells ice cold beer And your friend says to you, and he asks people to imagine this, your friend says to you, "I'm off to blank to buy a beer. Tell me what the maximum amount you're happy to pay for a beer is. And if the price they quote falls is. And if the price they quote falls below that threshold, okay, I will buy the beer. And if not, I won't." And he the beer. And if not, I won't." And he asked people to imagine what the threshold would be of what they'd pay for a beer on a hot day when they were parched on a beach for a cold beer. the beer is going to be consumed back where they're sitting. So the ambiance or you know the the clientele of the establishment selling the beer is irrelevant because you're not going to consume it there. And the interesting thing is in one situation he says there is a boutique hotel selling chilled beer >> and in the other situation he says there's a shack selling cold beer >> and your price changes >> and your your your readiness to pay changes partly in accordance to what you imagine to be the overheads of the establishment selling the good. Even though the >> even though the the utility of the beer as distinct from the how good the transaction feels >> the actual utility of the cold beer is identical in both cases. I think that's a I think that's Richard Thaylor and I think it's extraordinarily interesting because I think we can make you car car salesmen will know this you know make the transaction feel good make them feel good when they drive out of the place that was uh segini right you you know people are more likely to buy from you if they like you they're more likely to uh like you if they trust you and you have something in common with them and and you can use all of these things to manipulate people unfortunately It's not manipulation. Be careful on that because No, no, no. We got to be really care. I think we got to be really careful here. One, one thing might be that a genuine cold-blooded psychopath would intentionally might find it difficult. This is a Jeffrey Miller theory that if you're on a first date, there's an element where apparently, it's a long time. I've been married for 30 something time. I've been married for 30 something years, but women on a first date will turn up a bit late or do something a little bit annoying. And Miller's theory is that it's a psychopath detection test. So that if you >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the worst things that can happen to women is to get into a relationship with someone who's, you know, psychopathic because you end up with an empty bank account and a, you know, and, you know, your sister's pregnant by her everything go, you know, everything goes hopelessly wrong. Someone who's written very wrong. Someone who's written very interestingly about this, by the way, is fabulous woman who writes about education and absolutely brilliant. I I'll remember her name in a second, but she's written quite about this having a psychopath in the family. Likewise, Kevin Dutton um has also written about this about his own father. There are certain things which you can do which make it very likely that psychopaths will out themselves. So the perfect test might be you bribe the waiter to tip soup on them. >> Oh, interesting. >> And they'll lose it. >> Or you turn up late and someone like assuming you're not a psycho because you're Canadian. So you know that's you're Canadian. So you know that's probably >> by default we're not >> relatively low. We're too polite. >> You're too polite. Exactly. Yes. It'd be too tiring to be a psychopath in Canada, wouldn't it? >> Soup on me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been sitting here. >> It's I shouldn't have been here. My fault. I got in the way of your soup. Uh the psychopath will lose lose his rag. >> Um uh and can't control this. And likewise, if you turn up late, there's a chance they'll go, "Look, I've been sitting on my own like an idiot for 15 minutes." Whereas you and I would go, minutes." Whereas you and I would go, "Oh, I know. I only just got here myself. The traffic's terrible." myself. The traffic's terrible." >> Yeah. We don't fully know, you see, the value of what is going on in using a personal quality as a proxy for a decision which is simply too complicated to legalize or to reduce to numbers. Also, it is I'll completely agree in economic terms, it's suboptimal, but if it leads to downside variance reduction, which is what we're really trying to do. We're not trying to optimize. We're trying to reduce the optimize. We're trying to reduce the risk of downsize. Yeah. Downside variance, you know, and that's true in all sorts of things, investment strategy, etc. You know, the barbell approach, you know, first of all, make sure you don't don't do anything disastrous. Then after that, try and get disastrous. Then after that, try and get lucky. >> You you say it like it's a conscious thing, but I think it's an unconscious because because if it is conscious, it's probably a reverse signal that you're actually a bit uh offkilter. if you're consciously doing that. >> In fairness, if if you study social science matters, you've probably but I agree with you that the I mean my wife occasionally gets a bit annoyed with me because I'll get you know I will literally apply TALB logic to decisions. Just to give an example, I always argue that over 36 years holidays where I've rented a car are better than holidays where I haven't. And my argument is you have more optionality. See? >> Oh, interesting. So if you've rented a car and you find the hotel's a bit meh or the hotel's not in a great area, you can just get in the car and go and find a beach somewhere else and go there every day. You know, in other words, you every day. You know, in other words, you know, so I deploy occasionally we'll deploy these kind of taleb lines and I, you know, I'll also say let's fly from so and so because you know it's the satisfices. You you're the one who I remember this you said you should always fly from the smallest airport that's convenient for you. Is that it? you. Is that it? >> Oh, I'm I'm a big small airport thing person. Okay. person. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's it's kind of interesting because airports are schizophrenic in a way because the clientele of an airport is roughly speaking a 50/50 mix between people who fly a hell of a lot and just want to get through the damn thing as quickly as they can. And people who only fly once a they can. And people who only fly once a year who regard the trip to the airport as part of the holiday and they love going through a shopping center and looking at Hermes outlets or whatever. And so airports are effectively catering for two totally disperate groups of traveler. >> And you can separate these people in the security line effectively. >> You can absolutely you can separate them. And that's why you know um in a them. And that's why you know um in a weird kind of way I think you notice sometimes that the queue for the priority lane in security is longer than the queue for the amateur lane. But frequent business travelers will still join the priority lane on the assumption that the people in front of them are more competent. I mean there's a George more competent. I mean there's a George Clooney up in the air gag about that right and so it is very interesting because is it is it irrational if it's a very reliable mechanism so all right one example would be I don't think it I don't think it works very well nowadays because there are enough posh spivs around but in the you know in the 19th century if you were a posh and respected real estate agent you had a lot of reputational skin in the game in the local community both commercially in people, you know, so you were highly vulnerable to reputational damage both commercially and also socially >> because you know a small town or a you know would have been to a large extent a prestige economy >> and therefore you know dealing with the posh local estate agent rather than some guy who claims to be cheap is not irrational. you know then that you know irrational. you know then that you know the commission may be higher whatever it may be but in terms of reputational skin in the game as insurance against being you know treated appallingly but and you know I think there's a kind of weird thing going on which is that uh you know the the job of the real estate agent is to some extent to be the person who stays behind in the place where the house is sold to suffer the reputational consequences of you know of anything outrageous because the vendor of the house isn't really reputationally vulnerable if they're moving 300 miles away. >> Mhm. >> And so, you know, some of the role of these intermediaries is just highly complicated. >> But when I say that, you know, we fundamentally seem to attach very very high waiting to, for example, a call center experience versus website design. I'm not suggesting for a second website design isn't really important. It's it's almost like there's some experiences that are sort of additive or subtractive and then there's some that are multiplicative >> like you can multiply by zero or you can multiply by 10 like a difference in that one particular factor. There's a there's a really interesting organization I can't remember what they're called online they call this a brand quake. >> A brand quake is where you do something. It could be resolving a problem really well. That would be a very good well. That would be a very good opportunity for a brandquake. The person has a problem. you put quite a lot of effort and intelligence into solving it very effectively for them. Um and then you ring them back to check that the problem has indeed been solved. Now that would be an example of something I'll give you the per okay I'll give you the perfect story of this. My father uh who is you know half Scottish and um without stereotyping anybody was quite parimonious with what he bought generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's genetic by the way. just culturally he was descended from long lines of Highland Scots who didn't get where they were today by you know splashing out and he had a I think three um when he died he had three or four Dyson devices which he'd bought from new in his home he had one on each floor to save from carrying them upstairs. Now these are by any them upstairs. Now these are by any objective measure pretty expensive vacuum cleaners. Mhm. vacuum cleaners. Mhm. >> One of the reasons he was so fanatically loyal was that Dyson, now interestingly, I'm going to make a point here, which is a privately owned company. >> Mhm. >> And that and do not do not underestimate the importance of this. PLC's or um uh or or companies on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange are incentivized to behave like psychopaths because they're optimized around short-term transactional value, not long-term relationship building. I think maybe the the generalization is that like if they're private companies led by a founder, then they're not run by the finance department. It's so interesting. I think about this a lot where you you have these short-term optimization and long-term effectiveness are two completely different. >> Short-term money off versus long-term value on. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so you can there's always somebody making more money than you, but you maybe they're cutting corners, maybe they're doing things that are unsustainable. And like you said, are unsustainable. And like you said, you can always save money in the short term, but do you damage your brand in life? >> By the way, my theory is the primary reason for the success of these private companies. It the secondary reason is companies. It the secondary reason is they look after their consumers better because they're effectively uh unwittingly their practitioners in the customer value movement, not the shareholder value movement. Well, Buffett had this saying where his directive, his letter I guess to all of his CEOs after he acquired the company was the only expectation I have for you is to treat this company as if you and your family have 100% of your money in it for 100 years and you can't take it out. >> Exactly that. Yeah. >> And and I think that that approach enables even in a public company that enables people to take long-term do the thing that's optimal. actually they do something they do something they look after their customers and there is an interesting exception to this probably which is for example Costco which and actually enterprise rental car is familyowned isn't it enterprise is familyowned >> in the and I've told everybody this in the IPA advertising effectiveness awards in the UK my argument is that with the exception of PNG Dagio unilver marketing le companies I don't think that plc's what do you call them in you know publicly traded I don't think they can actually do marketing very well >> because the requirement for short-term self-justification and numbers effectively overrides the real purpose of marketing which is investment in long-term customer value. >> I think this is why generalizing a little bit but this is why founders outperform even when they lead public corporations. They have the same corporations. They have the same pressures, the same analysts, the same but they also are considering posterity aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, it's interesting actually the German car industry, although their public companies are sort of familyrun. Aldi famously, which owns Trader Joe's, is basically owned by actually two German families. They had a huge feud, but some families. They had a huge feud, but some things going on there. One of the things they do is they look after their staff better. And I think when you look after better. And I think when you look after your staff better, the customer notices. >> Well, this is part of the Costco thing. So, I mean, >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the Saul Price line of thinking which when he started FedMart he sort of outlined the obligation of our business is we have a fidiciary relationship with a customer. Yeah. customer. Yeah. >> And Jim Sagal who founded Costco was a student of Saul Price and later on they would merge the companies. >> Of course they did, didn't they? Yes, you're absolutely right. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I think that's interesting right where you treat your employees better. Uh nice story from Dyson which better. Uh nice story from Dyson which is familyowned. In fact, I think is familyowned. In fact, I think familyrun companies, this would include people like um SC Johnson. I think they should wear a badge. Do you see what I mean? Just as you have a kite mark on mean? Just as you have a kite mark on British >> Well, Lob Laws is familyowned, isn't it? For example, in Canada, family, >> family control McCain family control. Mhm. >> So what I was saying about the advertising effectiveness awards, four out of the five gold winners, it's only every two years this award and it's very very rigorously judged. Four out of the five winners, namely McCain, your >> Canadian uh heroes. Um McCain, Yorkshire Tea, Specs Savers, and Laithweights, a wine company. Four out of the five wine company. Four out of the five winners, the fifth one was Guinness, which is sort of a family company in a sense, although it's owned by a Dio. And so my point is that I, you know, we should actually have a kite mark that allows consumers to prefer to buy from companies which aren't listed on some stock exchange somewhere and hence aren't controlled by the finance function because they're more trustworthy. >> That's an interesting I don't know if I agree with that, but u it's interesting to think. >> Well, is Rogers what's is Rogers still family controlled? I mean, Canada's family controlled? I mean, Canada's absolutely packed full of Canadian tier. What about that? Increasingly you get family controlled but not economically controlled. So you have like a dual controlled. So you have like a dual class. >> So the western family would control lob laws to some extent even though they're not majority shareholder. >> Well I think if you if you have a corporation that's hundreds of billions and you control 10 or 15% of it. You effectively have control over the company. >> Of course. Yeah. Ford Motor Company falls into that definition. I think the f you know the family or some there's a particular class of shares. >> A lot of dual class coming. But hold on, I want to go back to Dyson for a sec. What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? >> Actually, it's it's not advertising, it's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And uh in many cases, even marketing. And uh in many cases, even though I've worked in advertising for 36 years, I I I want to think of myself probably unsuccessfully, but I still aspire to be a marketer, okay? not an advertising person because advertising is a useful toolkit available to the marketer and by the way generally is pretty effective but Peter Ducker the purpose of business is to find and keep a customer profitably uh that's the purpose of marketing it's to you know to you know to either create or find uh customers with whom over time you can engage in mutually advantageous relationships to mutual profit that's it >> so what makes Dyson so good at marketing? >> Well, the story I heard from someone who worked at Dyson for 12 years is that he was sitting in a presentation, James Dyson presiding and they were presenting the call center sort of efficiency statistics. By the way, I'm absolutely fanatical about call centers because I'm terrified that in an AI age, people will try and effectively automate them. Uh I think what you should do instead is make them slightly smaller but a lot better >> because I don't think you can substitute for the human in cases of unusual problems, special circumstances, empathy generally. Don't get me wrong, I think generally. Don't get me wrong, I think you can get AI empathy. I'm not suggesting that AI is going to be completely unempathic, but at some point it's rather like the equivalent of I want to speak to the manager. There will be situations where you want to speak to a person who can understand your specific situation and has the power to intervene to override the normal rules and regulations to solve your problem because it is common sensical to do so. Even if you know our what service level agreement doesn't normally allow us to send out a replacement part. In this case, since your part is faulty, >> somebody who has the power to do the right thing Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I I think that will ultimately you'll have to have the human as the last port of call on that. Also your call center is the only way you can find out the problems that people can't solve anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? So there was a very smart person I met at Microsoft who when they uh when they took over some fairly niche Microsoft product they put the call center in the middle of the development team. I mean, I would argue that the call center of British Airways should be on the same floor as the boardroom because it's where you find out where you're going wrong with your existing customers who are the most important people. You know, people talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay because nobody does selling better than Shopify.

So often the businesses are run by the map which is like the spreadsheets, the volumes, the wait times, the whatever, but the territory is the customer calling in and the problem. >> That's cool, isn't it? >> The map is not the territory. >> Yeah. That they're experiencing. And so if you're not touching reality, you can get distorted by the map. But I want to go back. You've said by the way exactly go back. You've said by the way exactly the same thing Dan Davis did which is one huge advantage of being a customer value company not a shareholder value company is that customers live in the real world and therefore you are actually rooted in reality whereas shareholders by the way not share owners but the shareholders are principally interested in justifying their own existence to their investors and therefore they're dealing with a highly artificial construct in terms of defining the value of a customer But I think what's best for the shareholders is what's best for the customer. It's just the timeline mismatch that people have. So if your timeline for well it's have. So if your timeline for well it's incoherent by the way the shareholder value movement is totally incoherent because over what time frame which shareholder is what are you optimizing for? It's a completely incoherent for? It's a completely incoherent nonsense which is very very friendly to stock market analysts who want a ready supply of quarterly data so they can their way out of things. How valuable it is to people with pensions is a completely separate matter because one of the things it does is it prevents companies from innovating effectively and it prevents them from investing properly in customer relationships. >> Okay. Come back to Dyson. You were telling me this story. Somebody had worked there for 12 years. >> So they were going blah blah blah average call time blah blah blah average wait time and it was the standard kind of call center metrics about effectively how quickly can we get these people off the phone. I mean it's a bit more the phone. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that. You know, I'm sure there's some measure of satisfaction, but it was kind of evaluating the call center on an operational efficiency standpoint. And Dyson basically said, "Stop right now. You've got this all wrong. The way we should look at this is we should treat it as an honor if one of our customers chooses to get in touch with us, and we should therefore respond to them accordingly, as if we're flattered by the contact, not as if we're bothered by the interruption or words to that effect. I'm I'm putting words in his effect. I'm I'm putting words in his mouth, but this is roughly speaking what the person said happened in the meeting. >> That makes a lot of sense. I mean, >> and by the way, that's why my father had four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I hope he won't mind me saying this, my late father. But every time he rang them late father. But every time he rang them up, which might have been only once every year. >> Yeah. >> They did something astonishing and they were really, really helpful and they solved the problem and the part arrived the next day. Sometimes they didn't even charge for the replacement part and therefore he completely trusted those people and therefore was willing to pay an enormous premium really over other vacuum cleaners which might have had the same notional you know effectiveness precisely because of that trust. There's so much opportunity here, right? If you think of you competing in a world where we're moving to AIdriven call centers, uh if I took the exact opposite approach, which is by the way, you should do both. >> A really, really good service organization allows for very streamlined efficient service for people who know exactly what they want and extremely emp empathetic service for people who are undecided, uncertain or find themselves in an unusual situation. And so you need to do both. And that's that's where I think the tech bros have got it all wrong because they see the opportunity of tech as being a one-way street towards ever greater efficiency, streamlining. And let's face it, tech streamlining. And let's face it, tech bros are not neurotypical in terms of what they want from things. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-making along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy, you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> You're using tech crows as like a >> No, no, no, no. It's perfectly reasonable to say that the people who work in this field and not representative of the whole human population. That's a reasonable population. That's a reasonable assertion. >> What is it you're representing when you say tech bro though? Um, anybody in a tech industry, just as anybody in advertising, myself included, is overweighted towards a belief in the ability of advertising to solve all problems. And I will truly admit that I am guilty as charged. Um, however, ad people don't get that much opportunity to convince other people of the rightness of their argument. What has happened is that in marketing for example the tech companies the consulting firms that sell stacks and I owe a lot of this to a guy called Adel Bori very interesting self-taught Libyan marketing writer former boxer Annel Bori and I coined the phrase technopplasmosis by analogy with toxopplasmosis which is tech people and consultants have taken over the finance department >> so that the marketing metrics the finance department has faith in and demands from marketing are not those metrics which are most conducive to building brand and customer value over time. They're the metrics which are most time. They're the metrics which are most conducive to selling tech solutions to the companies. >> What are the metrics that are most >> well it's all about short-term transactional uh bottom of the funnel um clickth through you know how can you shovel money to meta in a slightly more efficient way. It's not about long-term efficient way. It's not about long-term value creation at all right now. Now, don't get me wrong. All that bottom of the funnel short-term transactional stuff is very important to get right. I'm not I'm not disparaging it, but it's only a third of the game, >> right? >> And they're not interested in the other two/irds of the game because they don't make money if someone spends money on their call center or, you know, upgrades their call center staff or allows the call center staff to call out. >> It's sort of like cyber security. It's seen as a cost. It's a cost. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bonnie Blue would do really well in this because she's all about the numbers, not about the quality of the relationship. You know, funny enough, she did work in NHS finance procurement. Ironically, or no, finance recruitment actually. She recruited people for N for National Health Service finance. So, her approach to sex is merely an extrapolation of what she learned, I think, recruiting finance people for the National Health Service. All all about the quantity, not Service. All all about the quantity, not about the value creation, the the relationship. I like this quantification relationship. I like this quantification bias thinking I mean Buffett okay you're quite rightly your hero um is he was obsessed with the quality of the management of companies with whom he invested wasn't he >> well I mean I'm obsessed with personal factors I've read a lot in I think I'm going to give a nuanced answer here I don't know the answer so I'll preface that with that I did read a lot about what he used to do in the 60s and he used to hire like private investigators And what he was trying to determine, I don't think it was anything about the person other than does what they say line up with who they are. >> And if the answer's yes, I can deal with that because I know what to expect. And if the answer's no, if they're they can't go to work and, you know, claim to be a penny pincher, because if they go to work and say they're going to cut costs, but they're driving around with a Ferrari or whatever, like this is a thing that it doesn't line up. And so I I feel like he was always just trying to assess the predictability of people if that makes sense. >> In other words, by looking at their consistency >> consistency did the management >> do what they said they were going to do. the balance sheet changes over you know like he was a very he had a different emphasis on things than people I think realize and I think with a lot of his investments I mean my personal take is he was looking for predictability and it wasn't about massive disruption it was never about things being turned around he got out of that in the late60s with diversified refilling was the last real turnaround situation they sort of got themselves into they exited quickly and when They got burned. Did they quite Well, they didn't really get burned, but I was talking to Munger about this over dinner one day and he's like, "We just realized that we made a mistake. Uh, we were never going to make a lot of money in this business and it was highly competitive and we had no edge and so they got out as quickly as they could." Uh, and I think that the predictability of what he buys, at least his long-term holdings, like if you look at that, I think it's really interesting because it's like you can kind of see it. The railroad, people are going to be using the railroad in 50 years. That's a great example. So, it will be unbelievably example. So, it will be unbelievably difficult to build a competing one, >> but you can also you can leverage it if it's predictable. And leverage is is it's predictable. And leverage is is this interesting thing where he says they don't do a lot. And they don't when you look at the whole company, but on the railroad, for instance, they'll a decent amount of debt in the railroad because they know what the earnings it's very predictable the same as the energy where they're putting a lot of capital they put a lot of debt in and I talked to this guy in um Nova Scotia John Bragg and he sort of did the same thing and so he c he created Oxford frozen foods he's this incredible story he's this billionaire from this small town of 1100 people he started >> I've been to Nova Scotia what's it called Oxford Nova >> it's called Oxford Nova Scotia and started not one, not two, but three multi-billion dollar companies from this small town of,00 people. >> Is he still there? >> He's still there. Yeah. They're like that. >> Such a great guy, too. And it was fascinating to talk to him because he basically was like, "Look, you know, he owns North America's largest private telecommunications company." And he telecommunications company." And he said, "I wasn't afraid of debt at all." No. >> And we levered up massively. We went all in multiple times acquiring more assets, acquiring, >> but if there's something more volatile, he gets very nervous about the debt. >> So, he wouldn't do it if there was volatility. But he also had this thing volatility. But he also had this thing where it was so counterintuitive to what you hear on Wall Street, which is is like, I don't mind paying more, you know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, and I was like, really, that surprises me. And he's like, well, a lot of these me. And he's like, well, a lot of these things only come up once. I don't get another shot at it. And if I'm a private company, I don't have public company shareholders, uh, and it takes me, you know, 5 years versus 3 years to get my money back out of the deal, why do I care? I'm never going to be offered this care? I'm never going to be offered this again, and they're not going to build another one. >> No. >> So, when it comes to fiber optic in the ground, he's like, it's getting harder and harder to do. >> What is this company, the Canadian company in telecoms? >> Uh, it's East Link Cable Communications. >> I've heard that. Yeah. And so, but they not only do they deliver cable to a large portion of Canada, but they own a lot of infrastructure that people aren't aware of. And he's like, well, what aware of. And he's like, well, what difference does it make? And I've been chewing on that nugget ever since. And you know, you can apply this from a marketing perspective as well, right? If you if you have a client or go back to real estate for a sec. I have a client who's looking at a lakehouse or a cabin or a cottage or whatever you call them in in the UK or in the United States and you get a property and you say my budget is I don't know say 500,000 and you find a property that's seven and is it worth splurging on the $700,000 property or whatever it is and the answer is is this like a once in a generation property that I'm never going to have the shot at again and if you can frame frame things >> is also much more likely to be scarce >> the rarer you get generally >> and then overpaying you make overpaying seem rational and in a way it kind of is rational where it's like well this is only going to come up once so like I I have a friend actually going through this now they're looking at buying a family cottage and I'm like how do you think about these things he's like I saw this one it was perfect but it was a little more money than I brought this up having a cottage on a lake on which yours is the only cottage is the kind of gold standard for Canadian property. >> That would be the dream. Have a lot of lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as a kind of >> but it's sort of like what what do you want? If you want a second property, you want? If you want a second property, you want proximity so it's easy to get to. You want privacy. Uh so there's not a lot of things around it. And these things just don't come up very often as many lakes as we have. I mean the the prime properties come up maybe once every five or six years per lake. And >> and as Kaden said, in the long term, we're all dead. >> And we're all dead. So anyway, an interesting aside here, but when we sat down, we were talking about high trust versus low trust societies and introducing friction. Yeah. I'm introducing friction. Yeah. I'm wondering, spend a beat on that for a second. >> Well, I met um someone you must interview, by the way, called Philip K. Howard, who's written various books called Life Without Lawyers. He's just written a book which is coming out right now called um uh I think it's uh can do which is restoring the spirit of American can do and he argues that a large part of economic decline and social malaise has come from the overintrusion of law and regulation into practices which should properly be left to subjective human judgment. that we've created a culture where people are so afraid of making a subjective decision that they fall back on often totally inappropriate rules and regulations. And there are a whole bunch of people who are employed not always by the government just as much by the private sector who are much more interested in adherence to uh approved procedure than they are in quality of outcome. >> Because you can't get fired for >> you can't get fired for following the rules. >> You can't get me in trouble. Well, you told me to follow this proced and common sense would be to opt out at some point in certain situations and use your brain and judgment and uh but if I do that if I have if I do very little parapet there's no upside uh and there's considerable uh reputational risk and and career risk >> from doing something slightly perverse and different. But there are a whole and different. But there are a whole bunch of arguments. First of all, an awful lot of quality human decision-making of necessity has to be tacit and instinctive, not regulatory. There are various people I think it might be Michael Palani who says most of life is like a kaleidoscope. We never completely encounter the same situation twice. Mhm. twice. Mhm. >> And therefore regulating for the universal when in fact the great evolutionary gift of the human brain is adapting to context is inherently lawyers love it of course because they make money out of this. You know, arguably uh the legal system, particularly in the United States, has strayed into all kinds of areas which were once settled by two humans amicably discussing something and possibly finding a creative resolution to to the trade-off that's replaced by effectively we will take this to a legal decision and that starts to infect um particularly because there's no tor law reform in the US and that's partly Because I was told yesterday trial lawyers are among the largest donors to the Democratic Party because they resist any kind of tort law reform. M >> this has led to things that should be solved through our evolved human talent for conflict resolution being solved through totally inappropriate application of of uh legal structures to a situation which is uh in many cases not really adequately captured by law or where a legal decision is made which makes perfect sense within one setting but which sets a precedent which leads to ludicrous second order consequences. Yeah. So for example, if you accept the fact that a I think has happened in one of uh Philip K. Howard's cases, someone demanded that trees were dropped down in their street because one of their grandchildren was allergic to the nut that came off the tree. The argument would be that if you accept that, which may seem kind-hearted and uh you know and and generous within that particular frame of reference, ultimately you've opened up the path to widespread deforestation because nobody can grow a tree anywhere to which anybody could claim to be allergic. There's an interesting case um allergic. There's an interesting case um in England where someone broke into a theme park or some park of some kind and then while drunk dove into a pond which wasn't really deep and hurt themselves and then sued in the lower courts they said there should have been a notice warning of the shallow water because you could reasonably anticipate this problem and then it went up to the high whatever whoever it was the lawlords at the time and they said if you took if you took this ruling to its uh uh you know natural consequences you would have no lakes you know you would have no swimming you would have no swings you'd have no playgrounds because everything would have to be ge around with warnings about every possible anticipated negative consequence that could arise from this part of the environment and so what what happens is that uh you've created a kind of idea I suppose where the legal solution has become the default >> uh when it should in fact be the last resort. >> What happened to common sense? >> Well, this is this is the argument being that that your fellow countrymen, what's his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston Saul. Have you come across him? Saul. Have you come across him? >> No. >> You Canadians totally underrate yourselves. You know, you produce yourselves. You know, you produce wonderful people and you're always trying to import people like me from the UK or people from the US. John Rolston saw wrote this book which I think is called Voltater's Bastards >> and he argues that human brains have evolved with a variety of mental capabilities only one of which is the capacity for reason. >> There's also the capacity for imagination, creativity, common sense, you know, etc. We have a whole variety of different mental mechanisms at our disposal gifted to us by, you know, a few million years of evolution as a social species. And yet we've made social species. And yet we've made rationality the gold standard. This is what's weird about working in advertising, by the way. And I think it's probably similar way. And I think it's probably similar to theoretical physics and it's probably similar to entrepreneurialism. Okay, which is what's unusual about those fields is that rationality is the bronze standard >> in advertising. If someone says, you know, uh this is the problem and you come up with a completely rational solution, um people don't go, right, that's perfect. let's go and do it as that's perfect. let's go and do it as they would do in a finance setting or a compliance setting. Okay? In most of compliance setting. Okay? In most of decision- making in institutions, rationality, i.e. quality of rationality, i.e. quality of argumentation is the gold standard. In advertising, if you came up with a rational ad, people go, "Yeah, it's all right, but can you do a bit better?" You know, is there an ad that says the same thing, but in a more emotionally engaging way? Is there an ad that says engaging way? Is there an ad that says the same thing in a way that's funny? Is there an ad that says this in a way people will remember or will act on? So what is funny about being an advertising creative and you know I spent 20 years of my life either in or managing those departments is you know the rational solution is where you start >> you use it as a springboard to something better. There's a famous quote, you better. There's a famous quote, you know, fascinatingly from Neil Spore who said, "You're not thinking, you are merely being logical." Isn't it? I think you'll know that >> he was an interesting guy, wasn't he? In terms of his because he also was the person who said the opposite of a good idea, you know, in boring physics, the opposite of a good idea is wrong, but in high level physics, the opposite of a good idea might be another good idea. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What can we learn from marketing from the madmen era that's still true today? Uh today? Uh >> I think there was an understanding then and the remuneration of agencies respected this because you were paid on commission. So if you had a big idea and commission. So if you had a big idea and you came up with a campaign and the client spent millions running the campaign, you made money from that campaign for years after you'd conceived it. So it was rather like having it. So it was rather like having royalties on a book. >> Oh, okay. >> We didn't realize that at the time. Then media independence came along and so we had to be paid by the hour like lawyers and management consultants and we've never recovered because it's a catastrophic way to be paid and the reason it's a catastrophic way to be paid my argument is that marketing is actually fat tailed so is innovation R&D pharmaceutical research science okay in other words 5 to 10% of what you do delivers perhaps 110% of the value and therefore paying people by the power and demanding that every quantum of effort has to be matched to a quantum of value creation in some neat proportion. This is so the way market never mind advertising that okay right let's look at the whole of marketing as a discipline within an organization of which advertising is not a not necessarily very important part you know for a lot of organizations it may be you know relatively trivial what they actually spend on bought communication on the other hand uh you know how you design your reception or you know whatever you know that's still affected the application of psychology to value creation let's say you have a brilliant idea and the value of that idea last goes on for 10 years. And I've seen this happen all the time. The agency, let's say an agency had the idea. It may well have been the client who had that idea. They are held responsible for every single unit of cost they incur >> year by year by year by year. You cannot offset any of those costs against the value you created in 2023 by having a huge idea. Let me give you an example. huge idea. Let me give you an example. There's an enormous idea for a very large enormous American, let's say, fastmoving consumer goods company. There's an idea conceived by Oglev Australia. It has made that company in Australia. It has made that company in excess of a billion dollars in the last 10 years. It's still running. It runs in 10 years. It's still running. It runs in something like a hundred markets. Still useful today. For that idea, the agency in Australia got paid $350,000 Australian dollars. Or rather, that's Australian dollars. Or rather, that's what they made from it. So in other words, you have a billion dollar idea, you get to buy a small flat in a crap part of Sydney. Now what I'm saying is that this is not me bleing about the advertising industry. It's saying that advertising industry. It's saying that anything like R&D or marketing which is fat tailed, in other words, a small percentage of what you do, it's Jeff Bezos's point about in business, you know, in baseball you can only score four, in business you can score a thousand. In marketing thousand. In marketing when you score a thousand which and the purpose half the purpose of marketing is not operational gradual incremental improvement it's finding another way to hit the ball out of the park and score 100. If you cannot claim the credit for 100. If you cannot claim the credit for that except to the extent that it delivers value in the quarter in which you had the idea or the financial year in which you had the idea you are underfunding your marketing effort. So, it's like saying to imagine if you went to JK Rowling and said, "Yep, you can have the royalties on the Harry Potter books, but only on the first edition." And consequently, long-term marketing ideas when you're paid by the hour or when you're evaluated by the quarter as marketers would be. Now, you wouldn't go into a pharmaceutical research company and said, "You invent a blockbuster drug this week." No. Or you're all fired. You this week." No. Or you're all fired. You accept the fact that you spend a load of money effectively. Okay, this is the money effectively. Okay, this is the brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't find entrepreneurs in chess clubs. You find entrepreneurs in casinos. They're playing poker. They're playing bat gam. You know, they're playing games of chance with an occasional very high payoff. And a lot of life is exactly payoff. And a lot of life is exactly like that, but you don't know where the huge payoff's going to come in advance. The people who are running these organizations for the benefit of financial predictability are trying to make it chess. They're trying to turn it into a reductionist game where the most you can score is one for a win. >> They're trying to put a ceiling on. >> They're trying effectively to to to pretend it's a high variance mechanis low sorry a low variance mechanistic predictable process. >> 50 50% of your effort in life once you've ensured the fact that you're not going to starve to death, die, etc. You know, you've looked after your children should be attempts to get lucky. In other words, what Nim would say, I love this phrase, uh, increasing your surface area exposure to posit to positive upside optionality. You know, finding upside optionality. You know, finding opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I want to go back to this. I want to think about this out loud here. And maybe I'm wrong. With a book, it's great. I write wrong. With a book, it's great. I write a book once, I can sell it for the next hundred years, assuming I've earned it on my road. >> Yeah. If you have a great marketing idea which continues to add value for the next 15 years, the difference some of that credit should be offset against your current marketing costs. Fair. The difference is marketing also can go the other way and and like Jaguar perhaps or Cracker Barrel, I don't know if you followed the So you can create negative value. It's not like the baseline is value. It's not like the baseline is zero and there's only upside and the upside is like one to 1 million. You can actually destroy a company through marketing. >> The case is okay. >> And advertising. >> Uh some of those I'm going to defend the companies. >> Oh, please do. Yeah. Yeah. >> Because in the case of Bud Light, >> are you defending Bud Light? I want to hear this. >> Yeah. No, no, no. They could not have necessarily anticipated that because it was confected outrage. Look, I'm politically on the right. Okay. I get just as angry from confected outrage on the on the right, which is, "Oh, they've gone woke when, you know, you're merely showing, you know, a mix of ethnic groups you're advertising or something. This is bull, right?" And and the right do it and the right?" And and the right do it and the left do it. Uh there's confected outrage on the left, I would argue, about um American Eagle, and it's confected outrage on the right. It's done for signaling purposes by a very narrow group of people. Do those cases actually damage the business? I don't know the figures. Gillette did. There was an figures. Gillette did. There was an extremely Now, this wasn't confected outrage because Gillette ran an advertisement. They realized they had to advertisement. They realized they had to move on perhaps from the best a man can get despite the fact obviously that their customer base is overwhelmingly male for fairly obvious reasons. And they produced an ad which I would argue and even my wife would argue was needlessly um insulting towards men in that it conflated the me too movement with barbecuing. Okay. In other words, it seemed to take a definition of toxic masculinity which went which went the whole spectrum from things which all rightinking men would quite rightly condemn to things which for example two boys having a you know a small scrap on a patch of grass which all primates play fight. It's not, you know, don't get me wrong, sorry. If, you know, there's a kid wailing on another kid with a plank of wood, uh, you know, I'll be quick to condemn it, but I'm not totally, you know, the odd play fighting thing, barbecuing, I don't think is particularly objectionable. And that was particularly objectionable. And that was a case where it was almost a kind of act of deliberate affronttery to your core target audience. The Bud Light thing, to target audience. The Bud Light thing, to put it in context, was a influencer marketing campaign of which most people in the company were probably unaware where they sent personalized caners of Bud Light to a variety of different uh influencers, one of whom was Dylan Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess about this as a Brit, you're Canadian. >> Mhm. >> The gender thing isn't quite the flash point in the UK or Canada as it is in the United States. Did you know for example um that when it came out I found this quite interesting in Britain we've had pantomime for 200 years you know men dressing up as women you know women dressing up as attractive women dressing up as young boys Shakespeare you know crossdressing some like it hot was a highly controversial film with all the studios in the United States when it came out because it involved men dressing up as women now in the UK my grandmother went to see it she was a sort of conservative woman in a Welsh provincial It would not have occurred to her literally that there was anything controversial about this at all. It was simply funny. >> I think what maybe has changed is the meaning we ascribed to it. >> Well, in this case, my argument was okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan Mulvaney the face of Bud Light, >> right? >> You know, and I think creating these cultural flash points through confected outrage is something to be disparaged when the rights do it and when the left do it. I don't I I think it's equally I do it. I don't I I think it's equally I think it's equally absurd because you have in any communication you have to understand context and the intention of the person producing the communication. Now in the case of Jaguar they wanted it to look unlike a I would argue I mean I was talking to Rick Rubin who was in Hawaii and he'd heard about the Jaguar ad the it wasn't an ad by the way. Do you know that don't you? It way. Do you know that don't you? It never ran as an advertisement. It was a brand film they showed at the launch of the car. And then I had a right-wing the car. And then I had a right-wing podcast uh in the UK going, you know, it utters the most out, you know, um outrageous anti-conservative sentiment, which is copy nothing. Copy nothing was the exhortation of Sir William Lions who founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he said it in 1932. He was the original founder of the car company. You've also got to understand their position. What are they trying to do? So, so I'm just explaining this just in wider in wider context, which is >> they fundamentally made a mistake. I can't blame them for doing it because we all do this. We all benchmark against our most obvious competitor. >> Don't benchmark against your most obvious competitor. All you'll do is obvious competitor. All you'll do is make make yourself a copy of them. And Jaguar was always trying to compete head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Mhm. Audi. Mhm. >> And bluntly put, because of the scale of those entities, it was always going to lose. Because if you're the kind of lose. Because if you're the kind of person who's happy to buy a BMW, an Audi, or a Mercedes, and you're also happy to buy a Jaguar, you'll probably end up buying an Audi, a Mercedes, or a BMW simply to, you know, because of scale, winner takes all effects, all manner of other things. So, if Jaguar needs to survive in the electric car age, making its cars in the UK, which as a Jaguar lover, I ideally want them to continue to do, they've got to find a different kind of target audience rather than benchmarking themselves against uh, you know, companies which have gains to scale and a whole load of advantages they can't replicate. And so going for what you might call the car of choice of the wealthy younger creative class. Reasonable bet. >> It's a reasonable bet. Okay. I work in advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car lover. I really really like for example lover. I really really like for example the Chris Bangal era BMWs I thought were magnificent. I really really like those magnificent. I really really like those because can't buy one. And the reason is because part of my shtick, okay, is being a bit left field. And if I drive around in an Audi, it kind of screams I work in financial services, >> right? >> Okay. You know, I aspire to managerial roles. Do you see what I mean? roles. Do you see what I mean? >> Yeah. >> And so, you know, I've always bought slightly weird cars there. I don't know. I've been fed to there. I don't know. I've been fed to know what you have. What What do you have back in Canada? I got to ask. >> Uh, I have a Tesla. >> Oh, fine. You see that? You know, did you do you have a sticker on it that says I bought this before Elon went mad or anything like that so that Canadians don't key your car? It's >> been keyed three times. >> It's been keyed by and uh run into by uh somebody I can only assume intentionally uh in the past. >> Ota. >> Oh yeah. In the past. >> Well, Otawa is this like hot bed of Elon haters. Is it? haters. Is it? >> It's interesting because my mom got me one of those stickers and I I was like, I don't have a problem with Elon. like I don't I don't understand this. I'm not going to put that on my car. And you I want to relate this to sort of evolution. >> I agree. It's a little like um biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it? >> Well, it's also like going back to the Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things together, right? And I think we need together, right? And I think we need >> a variation in approaches. And the the point of this is like we need more people like Elon, not fewer in the world. Whether you agree with him or world. Whether you agree with him or not, this is how society progresses. We need differences. We have an environment and people thrive or don't thrive in that environment. Ideally, we have some that environment. Ideally, we have some sort of social safety net uh to catch people um if they don't succeed. >> But not ideally, that's essentially in any civilized society. >> And and so Jaguar the same thing. They're they're taking a bat as a company. They're being different. They company. They're being different. They occupy an environment and manage. >> If you think about it, they survive as Land Rover, Range Rover because they have effectively created the category they dominate, >> right? So I want more variety. >> right? So I want more variety. >> No. Oh right. This is this is where your wonderful compatriate Rodri Martin, praise be upon him, okay, makes this point that um economists have this fantasy of the world of companies in direct competition driving down price and increasing efficiency while supplying the same thing which is based on a false premise that people know what they want to begin with. Now I would argue when you don't create differentiation, everybody suffers. Now let me explain everybody suffers. Now let me explain because if you have a differentiated car market, it makes the car market more valuable overall to investors because uh you know there is more variety within the market. It benefits the companies the market. It benefits the companies because they can achieve a reasonable profit on what they do because it has some degree of scarcity or uniqueness and it benefits the consumer because the consumer ends up with more choice. What often happens is you have something like a regulated telecoms market or you have a regulated insurance market and everybody is forced to compete along the same dimension and what you end up with is just red red ocean competition and nobody wins. >> But where I was going with all of this is that going back to the Madman era and how you can create a billion dollar uh profit for the company and only get paid like 300k. >> You need to watch that. Yeah. And I think I've never actually watched MMA, but I think the the point that I was getting at is you can also create negative value and like how do you ascribe for the negative value? >> I can speak for Gillette where the evidence was that it was and by the way the research showed it was deeply problematic with a large swave of people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I doubt it. In some ways you could argue it's an ingenious marketing strategy which is that you press the hot buttons of 1% of the population. So they then repeat your message accompanied by their own signaling outrage. Meanwhile, you get free media coverage practically everywhere. >> But maybe I'm naive. >> I mean, the media budget for that Jaguar film you realize was zero. >> Maybe I'm naive. Like the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle thing, I think we're just going back to normal, aren't we? and like we've we've sort of deviated in the last few years and and that seems more maybe it's akin to my time and my frame and like when I was brought up, but like nothing about that struck me as rage or um on either side. Like when I looked at that, I was like, "Oh, great." It's just like an advertisement. It's a pup. >> Yeah. Like it just I didn't even think more I didn't think there was more to it. I just saw, oh, this is great. it. I just saw, oh, this is great. Right. There there's a kind of weird sensitivity signaling which generally has nothing to do with the groups you are trying to protect which is just it's sometimes called a purity spiral where you effectively signal your moral or political purity by signaling extraordinary heightened sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend someone else. even if the group on whose someone else. even if the group on whose behalf you claim to be campaigning is completely unconcerned by it. >> But like the opposite of her, whatever that would be, it would not cause rage in me either. It would just I wouldn't I wouldn't even think about the brand, you know? It would just be like another know? It would just be like another thing that flies by. I don't understand why we're so hair triggered at that this moment in time unlike maybe never before. way you have to really watch it before. way you have to really watch it in um and I've I've noticed this in certain people on the right which is I think it's fundamentally dangerous to invest too much of your own identity in a political standpoint to the point where I I've seen it in people both sides become effectively deranged. Now, you could say that's deranged. Now, you could say that's that's the effect of the people who attack them and that uh the derangement wouldn't happen and wouldn't be necessary in a different kind of media environment. What's different about environment. What's different about today? Why is everybody on such a hair today? Why is everybody on such a hair trigger? Why do we identify so strongly trigger? Why do we identify so strongly with extremes? I'm going to say actually with extremes? I'm going to say actually that everybody always blames social media. I would argue that the mainstream media, it is always in your interest, and this is a problem in journalism. It's always in your interest to provoke a fight because then you have something to cover. Nobody's interested in reading cover. Nobody's interested in reading about peace and harmony. They're interested in reading about discord and argument and dispute. By the way, that's an evolutionary tendency. If we're sitting here and we hear we heard a fight break out across the street, we'd be there with our noses pressed up against the glass. Okay? If if we heard, you know, people amicably discussing the weather, we wouldn't pay it the slightest attention. you know, where slightest attention. you know, where where we we've fundamentally evolved to pay attention to uh conflict >> and so the only difference is the tools available to us >> and the extent to which social media provide the mainstream media with the tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to find someone who was outraged by the the Sydney Sweeney advertisement, you'd actually have to do some leg work, wouldn't you? I don't think you now now wouldn't you? I don't think you now now it's one search on X or uh you know blue sky or whatever it may be. Uh willful misunderstanding is another thing that you know is another technique which is deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean I you know it's perfectly obvious that that had is not intended to mean Sydney Sweeney is the flower of Aryan womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's not that. Now in a perfect world had not that. Now in a perfect world had they had more budget maybe they would have had three celebrities of different different ethnicities or genders or whatever it may be um but nonetheless this business where you effectively effect to be outraged by things well I'll give you a lovely story about this I always forget which is I don't think phrases like uncomfortable or offended or inappropriate you know you know you that you get these things where you know your presence here people would find it you know would feel unsafe triggering okay they don't really belong in the public sphere >> you know they're matters which for you know a few hundred thousand years we simply sorted out amongst ourselves we didn't have we didn't make recourse to the university dean or the supreme court in cases where we were bothered by things because you accepted that's just part of life and we were allowed then creatively to find ways to get along without recourse to some sort of speurious rule book. Consequently, you know, I don't I don't think those phrases like in I mean, this is one of the worst things that happens. You say, you know, was accused someone is described in the newspaper as being accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I now have no idea. I mean, I've literally had to book people for speaking engagements. You go on their speaking engagements. You go on their Wikipedia page and it says accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no idea whether they're the next Epstein, right? or whether they told a knockk right? or whether they told a knockk knockock joke that two people found unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? Knock knock. At least I'm not being complet because otherwise I could have been misunderstood there. You see, but you I I now have no idea. Literally no idea whether the person's guilty of some utterly trivial infraction which would only have offended 0.01% of the population >> or they're not guilty at all. somebody just made up an accusation and the accusation became the framing and the framing became the narrative. >> So it strikes me as highly problematic in the UK. I'm not one of these people, by the way. I'm not, you know, I'm not JD Vance. I don't believe that free JD Vance. I don't believe that free speech is completely dead in the UK. But there are worrying signs where people who make a complaint on the basis that they found something disturbing can then call in the that's not a police matter unless it involves a direct threat of physical action. >> Yeah. I mean simply being disqued by something can't be. >> But we we've gotten to this point and you know to varying degrees in varying different countries where you know the we don't tolerate people who have different ideas than us and we saw this last week play out in the US with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And so whether you agree or disagree with him and his views, >> I have to confess I was only dimly aware of his existence beforehand perhaps because I'm a Brit. Uh I mean I I I'd heard the name and I knew he >> we see the same thing in Canada with sort of our politics, right? I imagine you see in the US too where media is definitely uh intolerable of one position and more favorable of the other. You can analyze this. You can study it. You could do a PhD on this. It exists. And it seems like we're just not capable of having to think for ourselves. And we're not capable of having reason discussion on things and and being friends with people. It used to be back in the the 30s, the 40s, the the Churchill era, both sides of the the house or would talk to each other. They would have dinner together. They would find common ground. How many of these people who are hypers sensitized on one side or the other, how many of them really exist? By the way, don't include really exist? By the way, don't include things like one of the things I find really disturbing is the practice of the media describing people who say oppose uncontrolled immigration and describe them as a far-right group. >> Oh, and well, because that is that you know you normal people are described as far right now. So, so in other words, if if you literally take an opinion which may may be held, by the way, from my own personal standpoint, I'm pretty benignely disposed to immigration uh within reason. However, I also believe within reason. However, I also believe in democracy and if a significant proportion of the population disagrees with me, I owe it to them to hear them out because their circumstances are different to my own. You know, I might be beneficially, you know, one of the slightly annoying things is people who are very rich people who are pro- immigration because they say their Polish housekeeper is wonderful. Well, that is an experience of immigration which is not shared perhaps by any means by the other 98% of people. I'm conscious of the fact that depending on where you are, you see the world differently. That's inevitable. And the differently. That's inevitable. And the job of a democracy is to accept uh the majority opinion even when it goes against your own. And so describing and vilifying an opinion which is held by a fairly large weight of the population regardless by the way the rights and wrongs of the whole thing. I'm not even getting into this now. Um it's deeply dangerous because people go well if that makes me far right it looks like I'm far right. I mean, insulting, calling people right. I mean, insulting, calling people deplorables is a terrible, terrible way of getting deplorables to gang up against you and then people don't speak up. They tell their opinions and then up. They tell their opinions and then you lose debate and you lose and then you lose perspective because you don't hear the other side of it. So, you think there is no other side and anybody who believes that might be an idiot like >> give an example on this debate which changed my mind a bit. a very very good Oxford economist called Paul Collier wrote this economically balanced assessment of general migration and made some you know pointed out that on both sides of what you might call the balance sheet it was immeasurably more complicated for example if Nigeria trains doctors who then immediately hoof it to the United States how how is that possibly a good thing overall in that a poor country trains doctors who move to a rich country which arguably has enough doctors from a country which doesn't have enough. That's not you know you have to >> depends on how you frame it right because another way to look at that and I'm not arguing for this by any stretch is that they come here they make a lot of money and they send that money home to their families. >> I agree all Collier said is look this is inordinately more complicated. >> Yeah. Um it is >> one of the things he said is the right for example of recent immigrants to family reunification is a bit dubious because you're giving someone a right which the native population do not have. So I can't pick five Canadians and get them British citizenship. You see >> I I've yet to meet somebody who totally disagrees with all immigration. It's a matter of what reasonable immigration looks like >> and also assimilation. It should be decided by someone other than human rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. >> I would probably agree because you know fundamentally as a as a branch of the law that is not a partial >> entity because human rights lawyers it isn't you you know that great phrase of is it Sinclair Lewis or someone which is uh it is difficult to get someone to disbelieve something when their salary is dependent on believing it. And just as management consultants have a huge incentive to sell in digital transformation programs to their clients and therefore we have a culture in business which more or less doesn't assumes that any money spent on tech is money well spent. They don't look at the opportunity cost. Should we have a opportunity cost. Should we have a better call sector? Buffett and Mer had a good way to sum this up which is never ask your barber if you need haircut. Yeah. And it's the same thing a human rights lawyer. It is in their interests rights lawyer. It is in their interests for human rights to capture a greater and greater part of public discourse at the expense of democratic bodies. And consequently, it's, you know, you're not really in the you're not really in the dispensation of justice. You're in the amplification of grievance business. It's very different. >> I want to switch gears a little bit. My kids had a question for you. >> Oh, good. Okay. Go on. A few years ago, we were in Italy on vacation and we walked into a Louis Vuitton store and they saw a purse and they were asking me what makes somebody spend I think it was I don't know 20 or 30,000 euros on a purse and I had gave them an answer but they wanted me to ask you some of those things by the way weirdly you can resell them for more than the purchase price because in some cases the Kelly bag for example they won't sell it to you until you've been a fairly reliable customer of theirs for some time and therefore the price on eBay is higher than the price they charge in the store. Um uh so so by the way it's not it it's not in it's complicated but they're vellin goods effectively a large proportion of goods depend for their value on being perceived to be expensive. >> So what goes into that though because they were we're all we're all guilty of it to a degree. No, but they were talking about the store and the service and the lighting. >> My wife just came back from, you know, somewhere where there was quite a nice night dress in Harrods, I think it was in London, which was £1,800. >> Okay. >> Now, you have to remember that there are quite a lot of goods where the purpose of the good emotionally is to say, well, let's take the endline. I often think there's a lot of hidden truth in advertising endlines. The L'Oreal advertising endlines. The L'Oreal endline because I'm worth it. Some part of that is the person advertising to themsself. So, you know, when you drive around in your brand new blinged up Tesla, albeit slightly keyed, okay, you're not actually doing it to pick up chicks, I imagine. I mean, maybe I have no idea what you do in your private time. Okay, but if you let's say private time. Okay, but if you let's say you bought a bright red sports car, yes, one purpose of it in a in a particular group would probably be, you know, I visibly have resources to spare. But quite a large part of this stuff is actually signaling to ourselves, which is, you know, uh because I'm worth it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of person who drives this. Uh it provides me with a kind of ego boost, a sense of reassurance, whatever it may be. And so consequently, if you think about part of the reason why bags became very expensive is that very high-end clothing can only be worn in quite specific situations. Mhm. situations. Mhm. >> On the other hand, a bag like a man's watch can be worn every day. So, one of the reasons why those things are expensive is to use a very interesting measure, cost per entertainment hour. I wear a Casio G-Shock. I think it was 130 quid because I' actually decided as a gross rationalist that the best watch is one that's cheap enough to wear in the shower so you don't have to take the thing off every day. But Paul Dolan, Professor Paul Dolan, who's the behavioral scientist at London School of Economics, I met him when I first met him. I said, "I'm intrigued because you've worked with Daniel Carnean on happiness and I noticed you wear a Rolex." >> Mhm. And he said, "No, no." He said, "It's extremely good value for money because it makes me feel good every single day when I put it on and in 20 years time I'll give it to my son." 21 years time, I don't know how old his son was, I'll pass it on to my son who can enjoy exactly the same thing. So, as a repository of meaning. >> Oh, interesting. >> Now, cost per entertainment hour is quite interesting because it was used to explain the fact that relatively poor young people will spend 90 $100 on a computer game, which seems like a lot of money until you realize that they might play that game for >> Oh, yeah. >> 80 90 100 hours. >> Yeah. >> Or more. >> Super cheap. >> So, it's super cheap. I mean, compared to going to the cinema where it's $10 per entertainment hour, more if you buy popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting metric. I mean, one of the things that metric. I mean, one of the things that used to make me really annoyed in Britain was when people, rich people got really snarky about poor people having large televisions. And I said, "Look, large televisions. And I said, "Look, you if you haven't got much money, TV is a source of long-term entertainment is spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a really good television on which to enjoy it because you're not going to go Porsche racing at the weekend, you know, you're not you're not going to be there, you know, effectively going to Glindborn or popping up to the bloody, you know, Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a really large television is a perfectly rational decision. >> Go deeper on this truth and endline signaling to ourselves when we purchase something. Jeffrey Miller is something. Jeffrey Miller is fundamentally right that a lot of what we're doing is to advertise ourselves to other people and the mating mind and spent two books I think you really should read because they're extremely good that a lot of a third book by my compatriate will store the status game which you must know you read it fantastic I've heard of it >> and I have to admit I'm going to the only caveat I give to reading these books a bit like reading uh the selfish gene is when you read them, you are at, you know, if you're someone of any kind of sensitivity, you are at risk of experiencing depressive episodes after reading them because not because they're not true, but because they are. And you go, God, am, you know, am I really that shallow? You know, I do things because I shallow? You know, I do things because I they feel good. I explain why I do them, but deep down the evolutionary and emotional reason I'm doing these things is really to show off or to establish, you know, some sort of oneupmanship or status. It's kind of complicated. Do I status. It's kind of complicated. Do I buy one piece of conspicuous consumption as is argued by various people like Lord Leard in the UK? Do I make my neighbors less happy if I buy a newer, better car? because what I've done is I've changed their comparative frame and therefore my pleasure comes at the expense of theirs. >> Now, that's not I don't think that's totally simple. I think if you were a totally simple. I think if you were a real car obsessive and your next door neighbor bought a Ferrari, you'd actually be delighted because you could go out and talk about torque vectoring and an adaptive air suspension or whatever it may be, okay? or the, you know, the normally aspirated V12 and you'd probably be made happier by that purchase. So, I don't think I don't purchase. So, I don't think I don't think it's absolutely simple. I think Jay Leno and Jay Leno's garage makes him one of the world's great philanthropists because he goes and spends a fortune on extremely rare cars and then shares his passion with an audience of millions. If you are a car enthusiast, you know, it's an extraordinary case, by the way, of translating money into something which is both a selfish pleasure and a generous pleasure. It's complicated. But when you read these books and you you realize that status is effectively a kind of thing within us which we can't turn off. >> The currencies will change. The status currencies change with fashion and time and everything else. Um, you know, there was a time where having a digital watch was the, you know, the the highest status thing. In my school, if you were status thing. In my school, if you were the first kid with an LED digital watch, people were in awe of you. So, these things change, but nonetheless, it's probably innate. Would it be nice if we probably innate. Would it be nice if we had the power to completely disregard the opinions of others? Well, yes and no. I mean, I think such a society might no. I mean, I think such a society might be better in some respects. I also think it would be kind of atrocious because people would kind of go shopping naked. You know, is shame necessary? It was book by Jennifer Jackwood actually, you know. I mean, as a social species, know. I mean, as a social species, patently at some level, we're massively calibrated to care about the, you know, the repute of others. And that's why some things need to be expensive because then it's a costly signal. It's peacock's tail. It's a so the guy who rescued the British sparkling wine industry effectively did so by improving quality by 10% 20% and then putting up price by about 150%. >> Cuz price is the same >> because in the sparkling in the champagne business it doesn't matter how good the drink is if people think you've bought it for $8.95 it's not doing the job it's supposed to do which is to signal generosity to signal hospitality or to mark a special occasion you know. Oh, I see you've taken out the good stuff because it's my birthday. And that's pot I mean, you're a Canadian, right? Pot latch was, I think, a right? Pot latch was, I think, a practice by the the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where they destroyed possessions. >> You know more of a Canadian history than I do. >> I I think I think it was tribes in the Northwest who practiced this pot latch thing where you destroyed things of value as kind of uh you know, a signaling mechanism. >> That that is like ultimate signal. It's like the rappers burning money on videos or something. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Signaling things that they're probably not intending to signal. >> There is a serious question here, which is can we take a an innate and immutable human instinct and harness it for good rather than for ill. And Jeffrey Miller's example here is let's imagine two parallel tribes. Bluntly put, in one tribe, the men folk signal their desiraability as mates uh by uh fighting each other with axes. >> That's a negative sum game. In the neighboring tribe, they signal their desiraability of mates by going hunting and trying to bring home meat which they then share with the rest of the tribe. That's a positive sum game. So there is this really complicated question which is undoubtedly human pursuit of status has both positive and negative externalities depending on the currency you choose to signal and also it's not totally it's not totally easy to say whether it's negative or positive. I mean, >> it probably drives a lot of human behavior which drives ambition, which drives progress, which drives >> I mean, if we genuinely didn't care, okay, if we had no shame, uh, you're absolutely right. I mean, no one, you absolutely right. I mean, no one, you know, I'm sure, by the way, I think also a lot of valuable goods are affordable now by everybody because they started as luxury goods. >> Yes. >> So, I always mention this because it's such a silly boast. My grandparents were the fourth family in Wales to own a dishwasher and it cost about hundred and something pounds at a time when their house which was a very nice house cost them £4,000. >> That dishwasher probably works better than a modern one too by the way. >> It's still working. They bought it in 195961 something like that. >> Why are they 4hour cycles now? >> And it's like yeah ready Tuesday week. Come on. You know >> I have one of these It's interesting just as a funny aside. I have one of these dryers from the 80s in my house. >> It came with the house and the >> It dries the clothes in the back. >> The repair man is like, "It's going to be just as expensive to fix this as it would be to buy a new one. I'll just assume." I was like, "No, no, fix this one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, "Tries the clothes in 30 minutes." >> I'm going to make an unusual foray into environmental responsibility here. Uh folks, everybody listening, do if if there's a do simple thing you can do, two things. put on your appliances at two things. put on your appliances at times when there is an abundance of clean electricity. You don't have to clean electricity. You don't have to change what you do. You just have to change when you do it. Secondly, if you've got a dryer that doesn't have a heat pump, get a dryer with a heat pump. >> Yeah. >> Because Yep. It's slow. I'm going to acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy efficiency of a dryer with a heat pump. Or better still, Americans, if you live in Arizona, dry your clothes outside. Because this is something that's slightly beusing because in Britain we didn't have the social stigma of hanging clothes up to dry to the same extent. Now we do now. Nobody would hold hang clothes up. But that's just a social clothes up. But that's just a social stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got a fairly climate. You're Canadian. Okay. There plenty of times of the year where your underpants can be hanging there for three months and they wouldn't not they might freeze but they wouldn't noticeably dry. But I do find it noticeably dry. But I do find it slightly weird in the US where if you're somewhere like Arizona, you could literally hang them up for I I was in Fa Ventura in an island in the Canaries. And well, the amusing thing was you literally they had a washing machine but no dryer. You put it up on the line no dryer. You put it up on the line about 40 minutes later it was ready to wear. >> So how would you market that to people? How would you change the >> change the behavior so that it's not necessary? Now I understand that people necessary? Now I understand that people don't want to put their underpants, you know, private things. I suspect that a lot of it is those weird housing associations already have rules that say you can't do it and then bit by bit the social norm spreads. >> Those American housing associations basically like living in a Nazi regime, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, it's like those co-op apartments in New York which are you I mean in London we never tolerate that degree of kind of uh intrusion before we're allowed to move into a property. The interesting thing about the co-op apartments in particular, from what I understand, I don't understand everything, so I may be speaking a bit about something I don't know, is the degree to which all people play it. >> Yes. >> Whether you're uh sort of like a student just graduating or you're a billionaire, you're all sort of like playing this this game uh in the co-op housing. But >> no, no, it is completely a game. And apparently they can demand information which the IRS can't demand. I mean, it is, you know, it is absolutely bizarre. you have a co-op board which will uh you know in occasion kick people out as well. But what probably happens is that well. But what probably happens is that once this is very similar by the way with the necessity of children playing outside which is once the behavior drops below a certain threshold you have an inflection point. Mhm. >> So my my parents couldn't believe this when I when I was 20 25 and I told them that when I was 11 I used to cycle 11 miles to the nearest town to see my grandmother on my own at the age of 11 and then when I told them which they did know I used to at the age of sort of 11 climb up onto the apex of the roof and just wander around on the roof 30t up. >> Yes. >> My parents were a gasast that they'd ever allowed it to happen. But if most people did that >> at the time it was normal. >> It was completely normal. Yeah, >> you'll be locked up today. My parents would have been locked up for sever, you know, several of the things which I was allowed to do uh when I was young. Now, what happens, I think, is that you reach a a threshold or a tipping point where in my childhood, let's say someone had abducted me or I'd been hit by a car, okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year 1974,75,76, that kind of era. If I'd been hit by a car cycling to Mammoth or I'd been abducted by a pedophile, uh, okay, my parents would have been described as unlucky. >> You get past a threshold where that behavior becomes weird and now my parents will be held as irresponsible and would be blamed. >> Yeah, >> I don't think it occurred to them. I was, funnily enough, hit by a car. It was my fault, be honest. I failed to signal before maneuvering. I was hit by a car. Nobody suggested it was my a car. Nobody suggested it was my parents fault for allowing me to cycle around the place. that was just a normal thing you did and then you get these weird I've got a few theories um for example what are the things that are products of social norms where you can suddenly hit a threshold tattoos among the middle class would have been an interesting thing in Britain is this true in Canada as well so perfectly middle-class people now have body art and it's normalized it would have been deeply weird in any middle class millier to see someone with a to uh in the 1970s or 1960s. >> It's just normal. I mean, like everybody >> No, no, no. I know. But I mean, this you you got to be you got to be 59 to notice this stuff. A lot of it happens over this stuff. A lot of it happens over quite a long time. Fresh. >> It's been a slow. >> I've got a theory that all British men would wear shorts all the time if it weren't for social pressure. >> I also think for example, okay, here's an interesting one. I don't know if you're into paranal sunning. Are you? >> What is this? It's a Buddhist practice where you basically expose your paranneeium to direct sunlight. Um I think that a fairly large proportion of the population are naturists to an extent by which I don't mean wandering around the streets with their schlongs out. But I mean that on a beach in a field in sunny weather in you know in some sort of privacy they would like to wander around with no clothes on because it's good for you. It exposes your whole body to sunlight. You get a lot of vitamin D. You know, it's generally healthful. And my argument generally healthful. And my argument about sunbathing is well, you know, evolution made it pretty enjoyable, maybe it's not all bad. And there are some schools of thought in dermatology which made a case that actually weirdly although it in enhances the risk of skin cancer, it improves cardiovascular health. So there was a study actually health. So there was a study actually among Swedes where there was a higher instance of skin cancer among Swedish sunbed addicts but they actually had a higher life expectancy which they didn't expect. >> So quite often you see what we do is we measure the narrow effect of a behavior but not the broader effect. Quite interesting in terms of >> you know how we might get things wrong. By the way, I wouldn't do it on a beach as there were children present and then you know, but if you go to if you go to parts of the of Europe, particularly Germans will just wander around naked. Now, I think at some level if they're no children. Now, in the United States, children. Now, in the United States, that would be perceived in a completely different way. So, quite a lot of these different way. So, quite a lot of these things are arbitrary. They're just in other words, you know, if doing something makes you weird, there is a point at which you reach a threshold, vegetarianism, veganism, etc., where it where it goes from being weird to mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is it's not an even process, >> right? >> And sometimes you never get to the threshold. >> I I see what you're saying. I know we're coming up to time here. I want to get to a couple questions. What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? I think a large part of it comes that? I think a large part of it comes down to, you know, Michael Pollani and his idea of a tacit skill, which is we know more than we can tell. There are some generally good rules, which is write conversationally, much more conversationally than people think they should write because everybody thinks they have to write a a and actually I'll give you two examples of this. David Oglevie, all his books are incredibly readable because I think he was a copywriter first and an author second. His pro style is very good and he also adopts a clever trick which I've stolen and which uh a few other people is that he writes extremely plainly for the most part but will throw in the odd cescoilian long word just to remind the reader that he you know you're not an idiot. You know it's almost there to idiot. You know it's almost there to flatter the reader as much as it is to flatter the writer. Conan Doyle, I was talking to Rick Rubin about this. He and I both grew up on those Sherlock Holmes short stories which are not only models of thinking and deduction and uh you know and a fantastic lesson for uh mental gymnastics. I think they're also mental gymnastics. I think they're also the Kingsley Amos believed this that he's one of the greatest pros writers in the English language because bear in mind a lot of that stuff's written in 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's written in 1880 does that what's that mean? Oh god, hold on. I'll have to go back to page 27 to work out how who on earth Mr. Homer Angel is or uh Miss Miss Mary missed something sudden, doesn't there, Marlin? At no point in reading a Sherlock Holmes short story have I ever had to go back a page to work out how who somebody is. Yeah. >> In terms of just absolutely brilliant clarity, uh those are astonishing. But in terms of persuasion, uh there are various things. So you use generally verbs of movement. You you use verbs in preference to adjectives and adjectives in preference to adverbs. I think you tend to use Anglo-Saxon words rather than the romance words for the most part without being silly about it. You convert a feature into a benefit. There's also an element where sometimes all you need to do is tell people a fact. Now I don't know any evidence fact. Now I don't know any evidence about this and I'd like to know it and I asked this question which is of the people who are antiaxers during co was there a difference between the people who are basically happy with the idea of a vaccine and the people who weren't partly driven by whether you knew that vaccination dated back to the 18th century and smallox. In other words it was a 250y old medical practice >> or whether you thought it was some weird new fangle thing that you couldn't possibly trust. I don't know. But possibly trust. I don't know. But sometimes, do you ever watch Press Telw Walker on YouTube? You know those mathematical puzzles, geometry puzzles? I really recommend them because weirdly I find myself on YouTube watching people solve mathematical equations for fun, which I never thought I'd do. But Fresh Telw Walker and I can't remember what it's called something like something decision or something. Anyway, um it's great great little YouTube channel. It's not that little. a huge following and sometimes there's a geometry puzzle which looks completely impossible to solve until you just draw one extra line at which point the solution becomes obvious. And so sometimes in marketing obvious. And so sometimes in marketing all you've got to do is tell people a fact. It's not always about persuasion. fact. It's not always about persuasion. It's not always about getting people it's simply putting people in a you know state of knowledge or belief or conviction that this thing can make a difference to their lives. And by the way, you're not you're almost always up against a problem, which is that the two human default modes of do what everybody else does and do what I've done before for obvious reasons. You know, what you've done before and what everybody else always does is not necessarily optimal, but it's much less likely to be catastrophic than trying something new that nobody else ever does. You know, so we're kind of herd species and we're kind of habitual species. So in the marketing of something which is genuinely new you know your the Tesla the the electric car there is a degree of extreme anxiety which you don't encounter when you repeat buy or when you buy the brand leader >> there's like a resistance you have to overcome >> you have to yeah you have to overcome it because just as a camera has a default mode the human default mode is do what I did before do what everybody else does I feel comfortable doing that very very rational default mode there's Nothing silly about that in terms of if you think about it our evolutionary um brain architecture those two things make a lot of sense but um it does mean and something I only realized about a year ago 35 years after I started working in the business is that as a consequence of that big innovative new ideas don't require less marketing they require more because you're asking people to at the initial stages you're asking someone to do something that nobody else has done >> and you're asking them to do something they haven't done before both of which create a kind of disqu and so providing people with conviction and reassurance quite often I suspect by the way in the early stages of a technology that happens one to one that you know it was my brother who's he's an astrophysicist so he knows all the bloody maths about kilowatt hours and stuff so my brother provided me with the reassurance to buy my first electric car I don't think if he hadn't bought an electric car I've now had Three, would I have bought an electric car? No, >> probably not. >> Probably not. >> Yeah. >> Uh, it will be my brother who persuades me to get solar panels or a heat pump or something of that kind. But big ideas don't require the the classic geek idea is our idea is so good it will sell itself. >> A re since your fellow Canadian Stuart Butterfield, isn't it? Who founded um Slack? Yeah. Is that right? Slack? Yeah. Is that right? >> Yeah. Uh he says the only real measure of innovation is behavioral change. that the only real measure of whether an innovation is significant is whether it h it both in first order and second order ways changes the way people behave. Now an interesting question is behave. Now an interesting question is is AI at that point yet? And my second question is the lesson of all tech is that loads and loads of geeks compete through for technological numerical superiority by some measure or other. And then someone else comes along with a cute user interface and makes all the money. It's basically Steve Jobs. money. It's basically Steve Jobs. >> Yeah. >> Nobody's done that yet for AI. Now maybe this weird thing that Johnny Iv is concocting which is some sort of weird pendant which talks to your mobile phone. Maybe that's what it is. phone. Maybe that's what it is. >> There was this thing that sort of relates to that which was Bill Gates had this saying. He's like the best and you this saying. He's like the best and you know I have friends living this now. The best technology doesn't win. >> That's a very engineering point of view because you're judging technology by its um engineering qualities rather than its uh human appeal. >> Oh that's an interesting reframing. >> So uh there are there are people in every field like in the camera world there are people called measure baiters. They're they're denigrated as measure baiters because they're obsessed with the numerical qualities of the camera. >> Yeah. >> You know, you focal lengths and all that stuff and they don't take very good photographs. >> Yes. >> And um saying that the best I mean undoubtedly by the way I mean you know Betamax is the famous example where they failed to capture network effects and in a world where there are network effects. Yeah. By the way, the best technology probably often doesn't win. I think that's probably fair. Everybody was competing to make a slightly faster IBM compatible PC, but they were all gray and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world would go, "The slight problem with this PC isn't the fact that the clock speed or the processing power or the RAM is insufficient. The problem is if I put insufficient. The problem is if I put this device in any room of my house, it turns that room into an office." >> Yeah. If you put an IBM PC, a gray IBM PC in any room in your house, including the you might as well put a photocopier and a bloody filing cabinet in the room, right? Whereas when Jolly IV comes along and has that lickable, the iMac, >> the you can actually put that in any room of the house and it it it actually enhances passion statement. >> It's fantastic. It's, you know, it's an adornment. And so their failure to understand the wider context within which they were operating which is the job of marketing is exactly the reason nerds hate marketing because they think in a perfect world nerd metrics win out. But the consumer is much more bothered by the fact that when you get to the bottom of the iPhone scroll, it gives the little bounce, you know, and we you could, if we're to be absolutely honest, you could ridicule um uh you know, Ives and Jobs over their obsession with uh you know, bezels and chfers and things like that. But of course, multiply that like that. But of course, multiply that by a billion owners using the thing a 100 times a day. Okay, that's a 100red billion encounters and that probably matters a lot more in fact than you know by the way I mean I lost faith in Apple when they canled the car. How interesting. >> Because I thought you they had the brand power to create for places like New York and London a form of microtransport which was really really cool, really really efficient. You know the brand really efficient. You know the brand power you have, you see, you know, if you're Apple or Ford or whatever, people will buy a weird product from you much more readily than they will from Alfa Romeo, >> right? >> Because they go, well, if Ford's doing it, it, you know, it must be okay. So, one of the gifts of having a strong brand is your power to really disrupt and create new categories, you know, new categories of transit, for example, which we need. You know, don't get me wrong, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to off 600 horsepower electric car, but when I go into London, I want a Microlino or an itty bitty little thing because that's appropriate to the task. And my argument is that they could have done something there. They could have used their power to do something and and you know, the finance people killed it really. It was what was it called? project something or other it called? project something or other never remember but but no now they're just changing the shape of things and making the camera a bit better come on guys produce by the way do you want a good tip okay I tend to buy and this will actually apply to electric cars as well always good reason to buy Korean stuff do you know why >> because they're going to do that anyway the Koreans are going to make fantastic tech and fantastic cars regardless of the profit motive do you know why to wind up the Japanese so they've got two motivations Okay. Other people are just trying to make money. Deep down. Do you know do you money. Deep down. Do you know do you know why the largest Episcopalian church in the world is in Soul? >> No. >> Right. This is really fascinating. I'm going to Soul for the first time. I've never been. But the last four presidents of Korea have been variously like Catholic Presbyterian. Now before um before the Japanese invasion, Christianity was a tiny niche missionary religion in Korea. Uh when the Japanese invaded um uh the tiny Christian population refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor and some of them were martyed for refusing to effectively uh pay due respect to the divinity of the Japanese emperor and therefore it became the patriotic religion because it was seen as a deeply patriotic entity. So I've got a hunch that you you know deep down you know if you go buy a Hyundai or a Genesis or something like that there's a dual motivation here. Let's make a bit of money and uh but that's that's purely so similarly if you want to look for anthropological reasons to buy um an awful lot of German businesses are driven by sibling rivalry. >> So Puma versus Adidas Aldi North versus Aldi South. There's a whole weird family Aldi South. There's a whole weird family rift in the German car industry which is too complicated for me to understand about Porsche and the family who own Pinchit. There are a whole load of Pinchit. There are a whole load of families which are kind of weird waring families and sometimes the family business has a motivation which actually >> the consumer is the winner. >> But the consumer is the is exactly the winner in in all this. Um but but going back to that family business thing that you know undoubtedly if you can harness other motivations alongside the profit motives most people working for a company unless you've bought them off with massive stock options because they're in the senior management most people don't get up in the morning to enrich the share owners. No, >> you know I don't get up you I don't get up every morning I don't know what a big shareholder is of my company. It's probably like the state of Wisconsin DMV pension fund. Well, for the best wish pension fund. Well, for the best wish will I don't wish them any ill will. Of course, I don't get up in the morning cuz I go, "Oh, I really worry about those DMV people's pensions in Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. I can worry about colleagues. That's a natural human motivation to serve those people. We always end with the same people. We always end with the same question, which is what is success for you? >> Just expanding the adjacent possible. That's a very pretentious article, but push the pebble a bit further. That that's it. I mean, you know, one of the reasons I do a lot of this stickick stuff is because the feedback I got was every now and then someone comes up to me and says, "I made a different decision because of something you said. Someone said to me, I bought my house because of you." I thought they might be about to hit me. We still hear from people about our first podcast every two or three months. Somebody emails me and and says, you know, because of that, oh, I love this. I never heard of this person. looked them up. And one thing I'm really clear on and I we've made this mistake. All creative people have made this mistake which is to go no that rationality is silly. What you need is creativity. No, silly. What you need is creativity. No, no. What you need is two strings to your bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode of problem solving. It works best in parallel with some rational or quantitative or datadriven measures. But the quantitative and datadriven measures should not be allowed to crowd it out. And so when I say the reason someone bought a house because of me is I said when you're looking for a house don't optimize because everybody will want that house. Instead find something the house has which most people won't like but you don't care about next to a pub. Now I'm not saying next to a rough pub. I don't want to have fights outside my house. But most people particularly older people would hate the idea of being next to a pub because they crap on about noise and the beer garden and all that stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a good happy pub is music to me. I don't get a sleep before midnight anyway so it's not going to keep me awake. Railway line personally it to me it's a bonus to most people it's negative. Go and look for those things where you can arbitrage >> uh what's possible. That would be my attitude. Now similarly if you've got a attitude. Now similarly if you've got a problem to solve >> don't purely define the problem in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in America you have a temperature and you have a feels like temperature which is by the way very very intelligent thing because what makes us feel hot is not just the ambient temperature. It's a combination ambient temperature. It's a combination of temperature, humidity, breeze and I think there's one other factor when they do the feels like temperature there's something like temperature so many feet above the ground that they factor in. Um now when I'm going outside I'm not going to do chemical experiments. I don't need to know what the ambient temperature is. I need to know will I feel hot and in the same way I think there's something really important here which is that do not define an objective which is designed to serve human beings without considering psychological factors because you might be able to solve your problem very very cheaply and efficiently by changing the psychology not by changing the technology >> and provided people are looking at both with a reasonable amount of imagination I'm not I'm not angry with a well bit. I'm I'm only angry with accountants and lawyers and economists, not because they do what they do, but because they have too much power doing it and they've achieved a kind of monopoly over decision-m which I don't think they have a reasonable claim to. >> That's a brilliant place to end this. >> It is not a bad place to end though. Fantastic. >> Thank you very much. We're not going to wait nine years before nine years before we get back together. How often are you in London? >> Uh once or twice a year. Mhm. >> Yeah. >> Oh, we must meet up then. That would be fantastic. >> Definitely. Loading video analysis...

Title: Ad Agency Stocks Seen Turning AI Disruption to Their Advantage

(Bloomberg) -- A key stock-market theme of 2025 has been the slide in shares that stand to lose out from advances in artificial intelligence, chief among them being advertising agencies. Beset by contract setbacks, Britain’s WPP Plc has plunged 60% this year, while rivals including Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc. have fallen by a lesser extent amid broader fears that AI will replace much of the manual work behind advertising. Yet a school of thought is developing among analysts that these companies will be able to turn the disruption to their advantage. Bulls argue that major brands will depend even more on agencies to navigate an increasingly complex, multi-platform media landscape. That’s reflected in recommendations for Publicis and Omnicom being near the best levels in years. “The industry is being disrupted, but it’s not being disintermediated — I think that’s the key,” said Morningstar analyst Mark Giarelli. This year saw Google’s Nano Banana and OpenAI’s Sora 2 — which create images and videos from text prompts — gain momentum. Coca-Cola Co. aired a Christmas commercial produced by AI for a second year running. Pressure is also coming from Big Tech, with Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. rolling out tools to help brands design ad campaigns by themselves, rather than relying on third-party consultants. The chief concern is that companies may choose to use these automated tools to build in-house marketing teams. In September, for example, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. said it developed an entire advertising campaign on its own, without relying on external agencies. ‘They Know Where We Are’ But what Google or Meta can’t do is to help brands allocate ad budgets across channels, said Morningstar’s Giarelli. And that’s where ad agencies can add value, as they can help clients to avoid duplicating spending between, say, Instagram Reels and Google Search, he said. That capability is based on consumer behavior data dating back to the 1980s when direct mail campaigns were dominant. “Ad agencies are quite good at understanding a variety of characteristics. They know where we are, what we’re thinking to some degree, and they’re able to tailor a marketing message based on that,” said Giarelli. It all comes at a time when the ad landscape is turning more complex, with AI likely to allow personalized digital content to be created “almost on the fly” for each consumer, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Bloxham. “There is going to be a strategic role for agencies,” Bloxham said. “With more complexity, you want more valued advice to help you navigate through, whether that’s the overall marketing strategy or media strategy.” Another argument in support of ad agencies is that lower production costs should allow more ads and more investments by the biggest brands, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Daniel Kerven. When AI raises the bar for ad quality in general, that may create an incentive for top advertisers to lock in to an “arms race” to create “unforgettable experiences,” he said. Depressed Valuations The debate around AI has weighed on the industry’s valuations. WPP’s forward price-to-earnings multiple has fallen to a record low. Omnicom’s valuation is close to the lowest since 2020, while that of Publicis is closer to its 10-year average. Any AI-driven rally in the broader market poses a risk to the sector, as these names tend to be grouped in brokers’ thematic baskets that include companies seen to be disrupted by the tech. Some agencies may come under greater pressure than others. WPP, for example, cut guidance twice this year as it lost a string of high-profile clients to rivals. It’s set to drop out of the FTSE 100 for the first time after 27 years. Still, deals could provide a silver lining for the laggards. Japan’s Dentsu Group Inc. is reviewing its overseas arm. The Times reported in November that WPP has attracted interest from Havas NV, which Havas later denied. Ad agencies are ripe for consolidation as they’re locked “in a fight for survival in the digital-led world,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Joel Kulina. --With assistance from Neil Campling.

Title: Your 2025 Crystal Ball Predictions Revisited: Was Anybody Actually Right?

Learn to make your money work as hard as you, so you can focus on your patients, your family, and your own wellness. Quick Start Page Recommended Professionals Financial Boot Camp Three hundred and thirty-six days ago, we published the 2025 crystal ball predictions from The White Coat Investor readers. Like just about every other year, I figured the majority of them would be wrong. Maybe some people would get lucky, but we know there’s a reason why one of the mantras on this site is about how our crystal balls are always so cloudy. When I wrote the 2025 crystal ball predictions column that ran on January 12, questions filled the air about how the first year of the second Trump administration would play out, whether an AI bubble would pop (the same question we’ve asked for the past few years), if the stock market and crypto would continue to be in full bull mode, and if the threat of tariffs on US allies would hurt the economy. Nearly 12 months later, the world has changed dramatically. Just like it does every year. Since I’m a sucker for history (ancient and recent), let’s, for just a moment, return to the time of January 2025—when people didn’t know what they didn’t know but gave valiant predictions anyway—and figure out if anybody got anything right. Note: all of the 2025 predictions below are italicized and bolded. From Reader Kendall, an ophthalmologist from North Carolina The Fed dropped interest rates three times in 2025 for a total of 75 basis points, and home prices still seem rather inflated. Kendall was right about those. His last two predictions were incorrect. As for value vs. growth, here’s what the YTD totals were at the end of November: US value stocks were up 14.35%; US growth stocks were up 20.03%. Growth ended up way outperforming value. A selection of predictions from WCI commenter TomS Prognosticator I’m not sure about the nuclear fusion or quantum computing predictions, but neither seems correct at the moment. A number of judges have come under attack, but nobody on the federal level has been impeached. AI companies have continued to grow massively. Bitcoin reached as high as $126,000, but in the past few weeks, it’s fallen pretty hard. I wouldn’t call that a collapse. At least not yet. From financial services company UBS Mostly good predictions here. The S&P nearly hit $7,000 in October, and it should finish the year right around its record high. Inflation has stayed steady, though it’s inched upward. And gold has continued to be awesome (as of November 30, it was up 60.2% YTD). From WCI columnist Charles Patterson My predictions are perennially wrong, and so I am going to try something different this year: whatever I think, I am going to predict the opposite: Patterson was wrong (therefore, he was right) about the stock market being up by 10%-15% (as of this writing, the Dow Jones is up about 15% and the S&P 500 is up about 17.6% on the year). The employment rate stayed about the same, but we are definitely NOT closer to world peace. Oh, and the US had the longest government shutdown in history in 2025. From analyst and writer Ben Carlson I’m fairly confident the stock market is due for a correction. I am not confident at all in my ability to predict the timing or magnitude of said correction. Preparation is easier than predictions. By mid-April, when stocks were way down thanks in part to the Liberation Day tariffs, it certainly looked like the stock market was wavering. But that long-awaited correction hasn’t come to fruition. Maybe 2026 will be different. From Bloomberg In its third-quarter report, Nvidia showed its revenue was up 62% year over year. Amazon, up about 9.4% YTD, was the worst performer of the seven. If you were following a Magnificent 7 index, you’d be up about 23.2%. One prediction from commenter Will R The US will have a recession. At some point, the people who predict this every year will be proven right. 2025 was not that year, however. A selection of predictions from commenter ADRad I’ll take a shot again since I did pretty well on last year's predictions. The 10-year Treasury yields have dropped a little in 2025, and while large caps continued to dominate, international stocks were 28.76% YTD and US stocks were up 17.16% YTD, as of the end of November. And as bonkers as it sounds, TikTok STILL hasn't been sold. Real estate platform Redfin Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the high-6% range throughout 2025, with the weekly average rate fluctuating throughout the year but averaging around 6.8%. Investors are anticipating that if President-elect Donald Trump implements a significant portion of his proposed tax cuts and tariffs, and the economy stays strong, the Fed will only cut its policy rate twice in 2025, keeping mortgage rates high. Tariffs could be inflationary, and enacting more tax cuts would increase the US deficit, both of which would push mortgage rates up. High mortgage rates are the second part of the equation that will keep homebuying unaffordable. The Fed ended up cutting rates three times, and mortgage rates dropped by a little less than 1%. According to CBS News, the average mortgage rate on a 30-year term is about 6.12%, and it’s 5.37% on a 15-year term (in January, those rates were 7.04% and 6.26%, respectively). So, Redfin was a little conservative with its prediction. Financial Times Will Bitcoin hit $200,000? Yes. Bitcoin topped $100,000 only in December, so a further doubling might seem a stretch—but why not? The Trump team’s wholehearted embrace of crypto, with digital asset advocates named to top Washington jobs, has already fueled the post-election ascent to record highs. Under friendlier leadership, the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to end its aggressive lawsuits against crypto companies and create rules to make Wall Street banks and asset managers more comfortable to trade and hold crypto. An inflow of institutional money, without the fear of lawsuits, will only send the price of Bitcoin higher. It'll be interesting to see what happens to crypto. It’s been tanking lately, despite the administration’s whole-hearted embrace of it. WCI Founder Dr. Jim Dahle My crystal ball is cloudy as always, and I am changing nothing in my financial plans based on these predictions. The misses on the stock market, Bitcoin’s performance, the Russia-Ukraine war, and small and value stocks outperforming large and growth notwithstanding, calling the Dodgers' World Series win made up for all of it. Overall, predictors were too pessimistic on the stock market and a little too optimistic on global politics. But who knows, all of that could change by next year. Now, it’s your turn for 2026. Let us know in the comment section or via email ([email protected]) what’s going to happen in the new year when it comes to finances, investing, or anything relating to money. I don’t care if your prediction is obvious or outlandish, funny or fiendish. Just give me your best shot at prognosticating, and we’ll publish the results in a few weeks. From special guest writer Dr. Jim Dahle: I asked Josh if he had ever used The Barenaked Ladies’ If I Had a $1,000,000 as the Money Song of the Week. As a music guru/snob, his response was essentially that it was too OBVIOUS, like using Pink Floyd's Money. I'm a big fan of obvious, though, and I think it deserves a mention. The lyrics are classic: “If I had a million dollars, we wouldn't have to walk to the store/If I had a million dollars, No, we'd take a limousine ‘cause it costs more/If I had a million dollars, we wouldn't have to eat Kraft dinner. But we would eat Kraft dinner, of course we would, we'd just eat more. And buy really expensive ketchups with it.” It's a silly yet aspirational song that many of us who grew up without much wealth can relate to, a bit like Chris Janson's Buy Me a Boat. One of the best parts of building real wealth is realizing you can buy a whole lot more than a boat or some extra food with it. You can really change your life and the lives of those around you. [AUTHOR'S NOTE: The best thing I can say about this song is that it doesn’t mention anything about Chickity China the Chinese chicken.] Happy holidays, everyone! What are your predictions for 2026?

Title: AI has taken over Wall Street. Should it take over your portfolio too?

The extraordinary rally in US technology stocks over the past few years, especially those linked to artificial intelligence, has left investors wondering whether they are witnessing the formation of another classic market bubble. For Indian investors, the concern is sharper because most international exposure from the country is concentrated overwhelmingly in US equities, particularly Nasdaq-heavy funds. While exposure to the world’s largest economy remains important, the current environment suggests that investors need to think more broadly about global diversification, rather than anchoring portfolios to a single market and a single theme. The rise of mega-capsThe US market rally has increasingly become a narrow one, powered by a small group of AI-linked mega-caps. While mega-caps are defined as the companies with over $200 billion market capitalization, 10 US stocks currently hold a market cap of over $1 trillion each. These include names like Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., etc. Over the last three to four years, these companies have surged on the back of aggressive spending on data centres, chips, and computing infrastructure. The scale of this concentration is unprecedented. “AI-related firms have contributed almost 80% of US equity gains in 2025, with just the five biggest AI mega-caps making up around 30% of the S&P 500 and 20% of the MSCI World Index, the highest concentration in nearly 50 years," said Ankur Punj, managing director and business head at wealth management platform Equirus Wealth. Also Read | Missed Tesla and Netflix? Here’s how Indians are now investing abroad The US technology sector now accounts for around 35% of total US market capitalization, and the 10 largest US companies comprise more than 20% of global equity value. Such dominance is extraordinary by historical standards and raises the risk that returns are being driven by an increasingly narrow part of the market. Punj added that the S&P 500 is currently trading around 23x forward earnings, placing it in one of the most stretched valuation phases relative to other global markets since the dot-com boom. AI-related capital expenditure is expected to touch $390 billion in 2025, heavily concentrated in a handful of companies and contributing to what Punj described as a “circular AI economy". Signs of a bubbleYet, according to most analysts and reports, despite these stretched valuations and the lopsided market structure, the US tech sector is not in an outright bubble, at least not in the classic sense. Some segments of the US market are indeed expensive relative to their own history, pointed out Raunak Onkar, head of research and fund manager at PPFAS Mutual Fund. “Some businesses have seen a sharp rise in valuations simply because their short-term numbers have surged with AI demand, but not all of these companies have cash flows strong enough to justify those valuations." But he added that it would be inaccurate to call the entire US tech landscape a bubble, because certain companies continue to generate strong cash flows that fund their growth. View Full Image Valuation opportunities outside the US look more balanced. A recent Deutsche Bank report makes the same point: The rise in AI-driven valuations has been accompanied by real earnings growth and robust profitability, unlike earlier bubbles that were fuelled by unproven business models and unrealistic assumptions. Dangerous dependenceOnkar cautioned that chasing fads simply because stock prices are rising is not advisable. And for Indian investors, the implications of the US rally are different from those for American investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized that the real problem for Indian investors is not exposure to the US per se, but excessive dependence on a single geography and theme. A narrow market rally, stretched valuations, and currency movements create asymmetrical risks. Punj pointed out that Indian investors face a double-layered risk during a US correction. “A US pullback driven by an AI correction could see stocks fall. If stocks fall, capital may move out of the US, causing the dollar to weaken against the rupee, hitting Indian investors both ways." Onkar added that international investing should follow a diversified approach rather than revolve around the US alone. For most Indian investors building global exposure, the weakness lies in the absence of meaningful allocation to the rest of the world. Beyond the USThe US comprises half of the global market capitalization. Therefore, any diversified global portfolio, noted Onkar of PPFAS Mutual Fund, cannot and should not exclude the US entirely. “If one has to build global exposure, investors will need to accept US markets as being part of that diversified portfolio. Also, looking at it purely from a US and non-US perspective might disadvantage investors as they won't be able to participate in sectors that are leading with growth," he explained. Many innovative companies across sectors are listed in the US but earn cash flows from across the world. Also Read | Investing abroad: Here are the pros and cons of using old and new routes Nevertheless, valuation opportunities outside the US look more balanced. Punj highlighted Europe and Japan as attractive regions. Europe offers broad-based exposure through cyclical sectors, industrials, and stable dividend-paying companies that have significantly lagged US valuations. Japan, despite its strong run, continues to benefit from corporate governance reforms, improving shareholder returns, and valuations that remain appealing in many long-neglected sectors. Overcoming the fears of technical recession until a few months ago, meaning two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, Japan’s equity market remains anchored by sustained reform momentum. Recent reports from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs indicate that Japanese equities are undergoing a structural re-rating, driven by rising dividends, record buybacks, and stronger board independence, marking a significant departure from decades of economic stagnation. Among emerging markets, Brazil appears particularly compelling. Punj noted that Brazil trades at low-teen price-to-earnings multiples while benefiting from commodity demand, structural reforms, and higher foreign participation. Taiwan and Korea also offer exposure to the global semiconductor supply chain, but remain more volatile and sensitive to US tech sentiment. Punj suggests that Indian investors diversify across developed markets like Europe and Japan, with modest exposure to emerging markets. “Retail investors should restrict international allocation to 20% of the overall portfolio, and as far as allocation outside the US is concerned, currently should focus on Europe/Japan, 80%, and some allocation to emerging markets like Brazil, 20%," he said. Diversification through mutual fundsInterestingly, mutual fund data suggests that Indian investors have already started rebalancing to other geographies. Several international funds outside the US have seen significant AUM growth. The Invesco India-Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund grew from ₹25 crore in December 2024 to ₹170 crore in October 2025, a jump of 580%. The Axis Greater China Equity FoF saw its AUM rise 488% to ₹1,501 crore over the same period. These trends show growing willingness among investors to explore opportunities beyond US-centric products. Onkar stressed that even outside the US, there are pockets of expensive and reasonably priced businesses. “Valuation opportunities exist everywhere, even in markets that appear overvalued in aggregates," he said. So, instead of betting on single countries, he recommended multi-geography ETFs, which offer instant diversification without requiring investors to track individual stock stories across continents. Saurabh Mittal, CFA and founding director at wealth manager Circle Wealth Advisors, said most client portfolios maintain 10% to 15% international exposure. But after the sharp US rally in recent months, the weight of US funds has naturally risen. “What we are doing is just rebalancing those allocations and bringing them back to desired levels," he explained. Money is also being shifted from US-specific funds to broader global indices like the MSCI World Index. “But even in the MSCI World Index, US stocks are approximately 75%. So you are not immune to what happens in the US," he said. The MSCI World Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries. Mutual funds or ETFs?Most experts believe India-domiciled international mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain the cleanest and relatively safer way for Indian investors to build global exposure. Punj highlighted their advantages: better risk control, simpler taxation, transparent structure, and none of the complexities involved in owning stocks directly abroad. Onkar added that stock-picking in international markets requires deep research and monitoring, which remains difficult for most retail investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized the importance of a staggered approach to investments, as predicting corrections or bubbles is impossible. A long-term horizon and systematic investing, he said, is the most reliable path. While that may be true given that domestic domiciled ETFs are trading at a premium, now may not be the time to invest through them. Rushabh Desai, founder of mutual fund distributor Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services, said valuations in US equity markets, especially tech, have become expensive, and due to Securities and Exchange Board of India’s restrictions on overseas mutual fund inflows, many ETFs are trading at unusually high premiums. In his view, domestic markets currently offer better risk-adjusted opportunities. “This is the right time to focus on home rather than abroad as the returns in the Indian equity markets have been subdued and with reasonable valuations in many pockets," he added. Investing via mutual funds, either through active or index funds, said Desai, is always better from a risk, return and liquidity point of view for retail investors. But if you are looking to invest abroad, you could consider outbound retail funds and ETFs that apps like Vested Finance and IndMoney have begun to offer. Also Read | What you need to know about RBI rules when investing abroad Experts also warned that chasing US tech after a huge AI-driven surge can backfire; FOMO buying and panic exits destroy wealth. As Onkar noted, investing isn’t thrill-seeking but goal-driven. With the US so dominant and capable of making global markets “catch a cold" when it sneezes, a broader, more balanced global diversification via the mutual fund route, where experts invest your money after deep research, remains the safer long-term path. The US market rally has increasingly become a narrow one, powered by a small group of AI-linked mega-caps. While mega-caps are defined as the companies with over $200 billion market capitalization, 10 US stocks currently hold a market cap of over $1 trillion each.

The scale of this concentration is unprecedented. “AI-related firms have contributed almost 80% of US equity gains in 2025, with just the five biggest AI mega-caps making up around 30% of the S&P 500 and 20% of the MSCI World Index, the highest concentration in nearly 50 years," said Ankur Punj, managing director and business head at wealth management platform Equirus Wealth. The US technology sector now accounts for around 35% of total US market capitalization, and the 10 largest US companies comprise more than 20% of global equity value. Such dominance is extraordinary by historical standards and raises the risk that returns are being driven by an increasingly narrow part of the market. Punj added that the S&P 500 is currently trading around 23x forward earnings, placing it in one of the most stretched valuation phases relative to other global markets since the dot-com boom. AI-related capital expenditure is expected to touch $390 billion in 2025, heavily concentrated in a handful of companies and contributing to what Punj described as a “circular AI economy". Signs of a bubbleYet, according to most analysts and reports, despite these stretched valuations and the lopsided market structure, the US tech sector is not in an outright bubble, at least not in the classic sense. Some segments of the US market are indeed expensive relative to their own history, pointed out Raunak Onkar, head of research and fund manager at PPFAS Mutual Fund. “Some businesses have seen a sharp rise in valuations simply because their short-term numbers have surged with AI demand, but not all of these companies have cash flows strong enough to justify those valuations." But he added that it would be inaccurate to call the entire US tech landscape a bubble, because certain companies continue to generate strong cash flows that fund their growth.

A recent Deutsche Bank report makes the same point: The rise in AI-driven valuations has been accompanied by real earnings growth and robust profitability, unlike earlier bubbles that were fuelled by unproven business models and unrealistic assumptions. Dangerous dependenceOnkar cautioned that chasing fads simply because stock prices are rising is not advisable. And for Indian investors, the implications of the US rally are different from those for American investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized that the real problem for Indian investors is not exposure to the US per se, but excessive dependence on a single geography and theme. A narrow market rally, stretched valuations, and currency movements create asymmetrical risks. Punj pointed out that Indian investors face a double-layered risk during a US correction. “A US pullback driven by an AI correction could see stocks fall. If stocks fall, capital may move out of the US, causing the dollar to weaken against the rupee, hitting Indian investors both ways." Onkar added that international investing should follow a diversified approach rather than revolve around the US alone. For most Indian investors building global exposure, the weakness lies in the absence of meaningful allocation to the rest of the world. Beyond the USThe US comprises half of the global market capitalization. Therefore, any diversified global portfolio, noted Onkar of PPFAS Mutual Fund, cannot and should not exclude the US entirely. “If one has to build global exposure, investors will need to accept US markets as being part of that diversified portfolio. Also, looking at it purely from a US and non-US perspective might disadvantage investors as they won't be able to participate in sectors that are leading with growth," he explained. Many innovative companies across sectors are listed in the US but earn cash flows from across the world.

Punj highlighted Europe and Japan as attractive regions. Europe offers broad-based exposure through cyclical sectors, industrials, and stable dividend-paying companies that have significantly lagged US valuations. Japan, despite its strong run, continues to benefit from corporate governance reforms, improving shareholder returns, and valuations that remain appealing in many long-neglected sectors. Overcoming the fears of technical recession until a few months ago, meaning two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, Japan’s equity market remains anchored by sustained reform momentum. Recent reports from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs indicate that Japanese equities are undergoing a structural re-rating, driven by rising dividends, record buybacks, and stronger board independence, marking a significant departure from decades of economic stagnation. Among emerging markets, Brazil appears particularly compelling. Punj noted that Brazil trades at low-teen price-to-earnings multiples while benefiting from commodity demand, structural reforms, and higher foreign participation. Taiwan and Korea also offer exposure to the global semiconductor supply chain, but remain more volatile and sensitive to US tech sentiment. Punj suggests that Indian investors diversify across developed markets like Europe and Japan, with modest exposure to emerging markets. “Retail investors should restrict international allocation to 20% of the overall portfolio, and as far as allocation outside the US is concerned, currently should focus on Europe/Japan, 80%, and some allocation to emerging markets like Brazil, 20%," he said. Diversification through mutual fundsInterestingly, mutual fund data suggests that Indian investors have already started rebalancing to other geographies. Several international funds outside the US have seen significant AUM growth. The Invesco India-Invesco Global Equity Income Fund of Fund grew from ₹25 crore in December 2024 to ₹170 crore in October 2025, a jump of 580%. The Axis Greater China Equity FoF saw its AUM rise 488% to ₹1,501 crore over the same period. These trends show growing willingness among investors to explore opportunities beyond US-centric products. Onkar stressed that even outside the US, there are pockets of expensive and reasonably priced businesses. “Valuation opportunities exist everywhere, even in markets that appear overvalued in aggregates," he said. So, instead of betting on single countries, he recommended multi-geography ETFs, which offer instant diversification without requiring investors to track individual stock stories across continents. Saurabh Mittal, CFA and founding director at wealth manager Circle Wealth Advisors, said most client portfolios maintain 10% to 15% international exposure. But after the sharp US rally in recent months, the weight of US funds has naturally risen. “What we are doing is just rebalancing those allocations and bringing them back to desired levels," he explained. Money is also being shifted from US-specific funds to broader global indices like the MSCI World Index. “But even in the MSCI World Index, US stocks are approximately 75%. So you are not immune to what happens in the US," he said. The MSCI World Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries. Mutual funds or ETFs?Most experts believe India-domiciled international mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain the cleanest and relatively safer way for Indian investors to build global exposure. Punj highlighted their advantages: better risk control, simpler taxation, transparent structure, and none of the complexities involved in owning stocks directly abroad. Onkar added that stock-picking in international markets requires deep research and monitoring, which remains difficult for most retail investors. Both Punj and Onkar emphasized the importance of a staggered approach to investments, as predicting corrections or bubbles is impossible. A long-term horizon and systematic investing, he said, is the most reliable path. While that may be true given that domestic domiciled ETFs are trading at a premium, now may not be the time to invest through them. Rushabh Desai, founder of mutual fund distributor Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services, said valuations in US equity markets, especially tech, have become expensive, and due to Securities and Exchange Board of India’s restrictions on overseas mutual fund inflows, many ETFs are trading at unusually high premiums. In his view, domestic markets currently offer better risk-adjusted opportunities. “This is the right time to focus on home rather than abroad as the returns in the Indian equity markets have been subdued and with reasonable valuations in many pockets," he added. Investing via mutual funds, either through active or index funds, said Desai, is always better from a risk, return and liquidity point of view for retail investors. But if you are looking to invest abroad, you could consider outbound retail funds and ETFs that apps like Vested Finance and IndMoney have begun to offer.

As Onkar noted, investing isn’t thrill-seeking but goal-driven. With the US so dominant and capable of making global markets “catch a cold" when it sneezes, a broader, more balanced global diversification via the mutual fund route, where experts invest your money after deep research, remains the safer long-term path.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it?—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Business An exterior view of the Oracle Field Office at Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo NEW YORK, Dec 12 : The red-hot trade backing artificial intelligence-related stocks has taken a bruising from back-to-back troubling updates from Oracle and Broadcom, reigniting concerns about frothy valuations and an AI bubble. Still, investors say reasons for optimism about AI remain intact, and many are wary about calling a top. Investors have piled into AI-related companies this year as the technology has taken off, with promises to make Corporate America more efficient. But some investors feel AI-related shares are overvalued. High-profile names such as Michael Burry have been bearish, comparing the recent AI boom to the 1990s dot-com era. For now, however, short-selling has been limited to smaller companies, with few pressing bearish bets against the biggest AI names.

Title: Intel said to have pursued deals that boosted CEO’s fortune
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/12/12/intel-said-to-have-pursued-deals-that-boosted-ceos-fortune/
Time Published: 2025-12-13T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
When the chairman of artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s chief executive: Lip-BU ​Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks to Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. ‍The competition for the start-up drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion (€1.7 billion) valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the start-up’s returns at Meta’s expense. Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.” The events show one of at least three instances ‍where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for start-ups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. [ Lip-Bu Tan, Intel CEO with Silicon Valley’s toughest turnaround jobOpens in new window ] Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment. Intel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a long-time investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or companywide transaction, the sources said. Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said. In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to chief financial officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan. Intel declined to make Zinsner available for ‌an interview. Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic US chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said. Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.” [ US government investment in Intel looks bad for LeixlipOpens in new window ] Tan’s deal making comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating ⁠it as strategic to the US and effectively making its citizens shareholders. Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.” Tan does not perceive his deal making at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these start-ups and at Intel ‌make him ​uniquely able ‍to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said. In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s deal making posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalise on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.” The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date. US regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock. Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalising its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.” Rivos was one of the big targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing start-up SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said. The rationale – ⁠debated inside Intel – was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said. SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the start-up and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said. Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks. Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the US chip manufacturer’s CEO ⁠was “highly CONFLICTED.” According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on US national and economic security. ⁠In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal. Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. Soon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganised the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A & E Investment, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources ‍said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said. One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the start-up, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A & E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows. ProteanTecs declined to comment. A & E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan “has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.” Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show. Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows. Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million. Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s deal making raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies. One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don’t want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specialising in corporate disclosures and insider trading. The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova. Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.” The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special ‌committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, ‌and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information. Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure. The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said. The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which predated Tan’s leadership. In 2018, SambaNova was a start-up with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on ‌its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper. SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the start-up’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which ⁠is designed for more specific AI applications. In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip start-up tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said. Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the start-up, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the start-up recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.” Deal talks to SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. – Reuters © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

You are expected to deliver a seamless, relevant experience for every single customer—true 1-to-1 personalisation—yet you are often armed with a fragmented stack of tools that treat your customers like rows in a spreadsheet. To overcome this, you need to consolidate customer data from all digital platforms, such as your website, social media, SMS, and mobile apps, to create a unified view of each customer.Currently, you might have an email platform for newsletters, a separate tool for SMS, a siloed system for customer support, and ad managers that don’t talk to your CRM. The result? A disjointed customer experience where a VIP shopper is treated like a stranger the moment they switch from their laptop to their mobile phone. Integrating these tools is essential to avoid data silos and enable a seamless customer experience across all touchpoints.This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market.

This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market. Why Multichannel is Not OmnichannelBefore we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions. Many businesses believe they are practising omnichannel marketing simply because they are present on multiple channels.However, if you are sending emails, running Facebook ads, and offering SMS updates without a unified strategy, you might still only be doing multichannel marketing.Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric. The strategy focuses on the medium: “How do we grow our email list?” or “How do we get more clicks on Instagram?” These channels operate in silos, often competing with each other and confusing the customer.Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows.Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Before we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions.

It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric. The strategy focuses on the medium: “How do we grow our email list?” or “How do we get more clicks on Instagram?” These channels operate in silos, often competing with each other and confusing the customer.Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows. Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows. Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts.

The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5.

Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Your brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure?

For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue.

It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams.

A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure?

By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Your omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience.

Title: Affordability, AI Stocks, Parlays and Bad Bunny Top Investopedia’s Terms of the Year

Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings. Tariffs dominated the headlines in 2025 and for the better part of 2024, making it our top term last year. Still, 2025 was shaped more by the impacts, or concerns about the impacts of tariffs on issues such as affordability (see above). That said, investors, consumers, and business owners needed a calculator and a good eraser to try to quantify the impact of tariffs on the real cost of goods, given how many times they were imposed, reduced, or reciprocated by the White House in 2025. There is no doubt that tariffs have become one of the key instruments of economic policy in the 2020s, and we should expect this term to remain popular. Among all the major asset classes in 2025, none shone brighter than gold. The precious metal surged more than 60% year-to-date, as investors, from global central banks to retail investors shopping at Costco on a Sunday, clung to it as the safe-haven asset it is known to be. Even as the stock market and Bitcoin steadily rose throughout most of the year, gold’s allure was too strong for those investors looking for a buoy to cling to in the tumultuous seas of tariffs and stock market uncertainty. Record gold prices spilled over into other metals, such as silver, which also hit record-high prices throughout the year. 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the super-scaling of the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem and infrastructure, and the stocks that took off with it. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA), have been benefitting from the build-out of AI for several years, 2025 was the year we saw companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) blow out their CapEx budgets to the tune of $380 billion, and pledging to spend even more over the next several years. The more they spent, the more their stock prices climbed, until, that is, the last quarter of 2025, when investors and executives began questioning whether these AI stocks are in a bubble. According to Investopedia's most recent sentiment survey, our readers agree. The Trump administration came into office pledging to make America the ‘Crypto Capital of the World’. It began that process by passing the Stablecoin Act of 2025, also known as the Genius Act. That established the first federal framework for payment Stablecoins in the U.S. Our readers wanted to understand what a Stablecoin actually is, how it compares to Bitcoin, and why our federal government wants to introduce a digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar into our banking system. 2025 will also be remembered as the year that sports betting, event betting, and predictive markets went mainstream. Americans are expected to wager over $150 billion in 2025, and with more states legalizing sports betting, bet on that number to grow. As it does, our readers wanted to learn more about the high-risk, high-reward parlay bet, which links together two or more individual bets, known as legs, but only pays out if every leg wins. While there weren’t any major convictions or charges of insider trading in 2025, our readers were searching for what it actually means and whether it was happening in front of us on several occasions this year. This term received extra attention in early April following the so-called “Liberation Day,” as the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on hundreds of trading partners, leading to a near 5% selloff in the S&P 500. As the stock market went on to fall as much as 19% in the subsequent days, the President’s post telling Americans to “Buy Stocks” just before he lifted or paused many of those tariffs on April 9th raised more than a few eyebrows, especially as the market roared back to record highs. Reports of government officials selling stocks before Liberation Day surfaced soon after, but charges were never filed. While technically not a financial term, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, better known as ‘Bad Bunny,’ got as much attention for his business acumen and net worth as he did for his latest best-selling album. 2025 was a good year for Bad Bunny’s money, as he was Spotify’s most-streamed artist, sold out arenas around the world, including a residency in his home country of Puerto Rico, hosted SNL, and was selected to be the headline act at the Super Bowl in 2026. His net worth, according to our latest report, is $88 million, and climbing. Kevin Winter / Getty Images The private markets, which include private capital and private equity, were once an exclusive playground for institutional and well-heeled accredited investors. Inherently opaque, often risky, but tempting with upside potential, private markets have received a public reception from the new administration, which is lowering regulatory hurdles to allow them into defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. In August, President Trump signed an executive order to ‘democratize’ access to alternative investments, such as private markets, paving the way for their inclusion in retirement plans. Our readers sought to learn everything they could about private markets and their potential impact on their portfolios. One of the simplest strategies to generate income in the stock market this year was through covered calls in the options market. The strategy involves an investor who owns a stock with no intention of selling it, does not expect the price to move significantly, and sells a call option that generates a premium for the option's term. If the stock rises in price, the investor gets their premium payment plus the increase in the stock price, up to the strike price. If the stock falls, the investor still gets the premium, which offsets some of the loss. As the stock market has been churning sideways since September, more of our readers have wanted to learn and use this strategy.

Title: Replacing The Woo Products Module With Custom Loops In Divi 5

Posted on December 12, 2025 by Christopher Morris 3 Comments The WooCommerce Products Module is Divi’s built-in solution for displaying products. It automatically connects to your shop and provides quick toggles for product images, titles, prices, ratings, and add-to-cart buttons. Divi 5‘s new Loop Builder takes a fundamentally different approach to building product features. You design the product card with any modules you choose, and then dynamically feed WooCommerce data into it. Both tools display product listings, yet each excels in different scenarios. You can use either, but the Loop Builder offers far more flexibility, which could help you build a better online store. Let’s compare the two. The WooCommerce Products Module is built for standard ecommerce patterns. It assumes you want recognizable product cards and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how WooCommerce products work. Every product shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as ecommerce content. These shared characteristics include: The Products Module was designed with these traditional elements in mind. Images show what you’re selling. Titles identify the product. Prices tell customers what it costs. The add-to-cart button completes the sale. Divi’s Products Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in filtering tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the rating but keep the price, show sale badges, or skip the description. Small decisions and quick results. The Products Module can display WooCommerce products along with filtering options for product types (like featured products). The Products Module works great when you stick to WooCommerce’s standard data structure. It limits its options to fields that are native to WooCommerce’s default product data. Detailed specifications, custom badges, shipping estimates, or anything custom won’t appear in the Products Module because it was built for standard WooCommerce fields. The module has no toggle for those custom product details. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module uses a fixed grid structure, allowing you to set the number of grid columns. However, it does not include Divi’s newest Grid and Flex CSS layout controls. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying WooCommerce products. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, the Loop Builder allows you to construct your product display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Products Module. With the Products Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With the Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to working with custom product displays: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop” with a query type of “Products,” it repeats itself for each matching product. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, Button, and any other Divi modules. Can also be used in the Theme Builder set to “Posts for Current Page” You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct WooCommerce data token. Divi’s UI makes this straightforward. The Image points to the product image. The Heading points to the product title. The Text Module can show the price. The Button links to the add-to-cart action or product page. This modular approach gives you complete structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can add multiple text blocks for price, SKU, and custom fields. You can create unique badge designs or custom rating displays. This way, you build the product card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a quick scenario. We’ll quickly build a similar product card (compared with the example Products Module above) and swap the data sources to show the Loop Builder’s flexibility. And apply some styles that will be used with each post item in the loop. Then, build a custom Loop for standard WooCommerce products. Use the “Product” post type. We will also use four post items in this loop. Now, we’ll quickly assign some basic dynamic content to the sub-modules of this Loop. We’ll start with Product Featured Image, Product Title, and Product Price. Now, if you have custom fields with data applied through a WooCommerce extension, you can apply those via Custom Field assignments inside the Dynamic Content selector. I also went ahead and added an icon and changed up the flex settings to arrange the items better. And this is the end result. A clean-looking card for a product category page through the Theme Builder. It utilizes a custom field and simple filtering, making the Loop Builder ideal for this purpose. How do you add those custom fields to WooCommerce products? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here, while Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset can also do the job. Numerous WooCommerce extensions offer this functionality specifically for WooCommerce. This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Products Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Products Module when the card you want to design includes only standard WooCommerce fields. Straightforward product catalogs that link out to individual product pages. The Products Module also has slightly better filtering options, so you can showcase featured products or those on sale. Use the Loop Builder when you need custom fields that standard WooCommerce products don’t include, or when your product card design doesn’t match a stock pattern. The trade-off is that you’ll need to work around the missing WooCommerce-specific filters by using categories, tags, or custom fields instead. Divi’s Products Module is still the fastest way to display a standard WooCommerce product grid, and it remains the only option for WooCommerce-specific filters, such as featured products, sale items, best-sellers, and sorting by price or popularity. The Loop Builder unlocks custom product cards, custom fields, unique layouts, and complete design control. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design you have in mind, whereas the Products Module has some limitations. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the particular section you are creating.

The Loop builder is great for developing a Woocommerce product page, the bit that’s a nightmare is sorting (ordering) the products. I don’t really want to sort or order by on any of the preset fields like date etc. I want to order using a custom field like “Product order by” or “Product sort order” That way my client can determine what order the product are ordered. Right now the only way is to manipulate the post dates and the order by date. Absolutely agree. The looper only needs a custom sort to allow it to be used in so many more jobs. As it stands that missing custom sort is a real handicap. It’s good to have a choice but what we need most is to display first level categories and it’ still impossible!

Title: AI is powering Trump’s economy, but American voters are getting worried

Time Published: 2025-12-12T15:35:19Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump is heading into the 2026 election year vowing to pull out all the stops to promote artificial intelligence — just as American voters are starting to voice some doubts. All through Trump’s first year back in office, almost everyone had something to say about AI. Economists detailed how it’s powering US growth. White House aides explained why it’s key to staying ahead of China. Stock-watchers cheered a market boom, and fretted about a bubble. Tech geeks speculated about what the bots might one day be able to do. The president helped fuel the buzz, appearing alongside various tycoons to announce big AI projects. On Thursday, he signed an order seeking to limit states from imposing their own curbs on AI — marking another win for the industry. “Our administration is committed to total dominance in technology,” he said a day before at a White House event with prominent tech executives. “Right now, we’re leading artificial intelligence by a lot.” One group that hasn’t gotten much of a hearing above the hubbub is the US electorate. But in last month’s off-year contests there were signs of an AI backlash, one that could amplify concerns about the cost of living and the job-market outlook in Trump’s economy. At the local level, many voters objected to the spread of data centers, the building blocks of AI’s advance, whose huge demand for electricity is getting linked to bigger household bills. That affordability issue now has political traction. It helped Democrats score major wins in Virginia and New Jersey. On top of that, there’s the employment risk. Data centers create plenty of construction jobs but not so many once they’re up and running. Worse, there are widespread fears that the technologies incubated there may turn out to be job-killers. None of this means AI isn’t key to America’s economic future — just that it’s hard to sell as a political priority in the meantime. That’s particularly true for a White House already struggling to convince voters that Trump’s economic policies are working. Perhaps there’s an echo of the debate over free trade. Economists, executives and investors all predicted long-run benefits, but millions of American voters reckoned they’d drawn a short straw, and the disruption helped bring Trump to power. Now Steve Bannon, one of the populist MAGA movement’s architects, has all but declared war on AI, citing economic, political and even religious reasons to rein it in. “They are coming at you from every different direction. They want your productivity until they get the robots and then they’ll toss you aside like trash,” the former Trump strategist said on his “Bannon’s War Room” podcast, in a November episode devoted to the dangers of AI. The White House has pointed to potential productivity gains from AI as enriching workers and businesses. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett — seen as the frontrunner to be Trump’s next Federal Reserve chair — in a recent Fox Business interview said AI would “make a lot of productive workers a heck of a lot of money.” AI technology will aid, not replace, American workers, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to detail their thinking. Ensuring the US is a leader in AI will help create more employment opportunities and also lower costs for services and goods, further spurring job growth, according to the official. The Department of Labor said it was investing in skills training to help workers benefit from AI and to help fill surging demand for jobs to build out the technology’s infrastructure. Still, there’s anxiety at the grassroots level — and it’s not only politicians who’ll have to factor that in. There’s been a surge this year in the number of data center plans blocked or delayed by local opposition, according to Data Center Watch, a monitor run by AI intelligence company 10a Labs. Its research identifies $98 billion of investments stymied in the second quarter, more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023. That’s adding time, uncertainty and political risk to some projects, which investors will likely start to price in, said Miquel Vila, an analyst at the group. Lordstown in northeast Ohio illustrates the gap between the upbeat talk from the top and anxiety on the ground. It’s one of five locations where AI infrastructure is being developed as part of Stargate, a $500 billion project announced by Trump in January on his first full day back in the White House. But not far away, another company backing a separate $3.6 billion data center project is finding that many residents don’t want it — even though the region could use an economic lift, after losing 40% of its manufacturing jobs in the past two decades. Bristolville 25 Developer LLC wants to build a data center campus on 133 acres of industrially zoned property. The village council is trying to block large-scale data centers because of concerns like rising power costs, water usage and pollution, and Lordstown Mayor Jackie Woodward said four council elections last month hinged on whether candidates opposed such projects. “I don’t have the money to pay a bigger electric bill or bigger water bill,” Richard Coe, a 78-year-old Lordstown retiree, told the council at a Nov. 3 meeting. “So I would appreciate that our council members take that into account.” In letters to village officials, attorneys for Bristolville outlined benefits that the investment would bring, including more than a million dollars a year in state and local income tax revenue, plus millions in property taxes. Bristolville has also offered $10.8 million for water infrastructure upgrades, as well as contributions to a community fund for facilities like an event center or pickleball court. The venture would employ an estimated 1,600 workers during peak construction, and then 120 full-time employees with an average wage of more than $84 per hour. That’s not enough permanent jobs to justify the impact on the community, said Lordstown Council President Robert Bond. “We don’t see the advantage tying up large industrial acreage for 120 jobs.” Among leading Republicans, it’s state governors who are most worried about an AI backlash, according to one Trump adviser who says the party wants to “win the AI race” but hasn’t really figured out what that means. Concerns at this stage are more focused on electricity bills, which threaten to become a benchmark affordability measure like gas-pump prices have traditionally been, than the risk to white-collar jobs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, who earlier this year intervened to preserve an exemption from state sales taxes for data centers, isn’t among the doubters. He says rising electricity prices are “a legitimate discussion,” but doesn’t think local opposition will stunt the industry in Ohio. “We believe that data centers bring other business, that they bring other jobs into the state,” DeWine says. Back in Washington, the Trump administration seems chiefly interested in ensuring AI companies keep expanding — since that’s what is powering the economy and equity markets. Trump this week granted permission to Nvidia Corp. to export its high-end H200 chip to China, bypassing national security concerns that had previously loomed large. Many analysts calculate that the AI boom accounted for more than half of US GDP growth in the first six months of 2025, and see that trend continuing when third-quarter numbers come out. The big tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. — have tripled their capital spending, which will likely exceed $500 billion in 2026 according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Many of these companies donated to Trump’s presidential inauguration, or his new White House ballroom, or both. There’s consensus on Wall Street that AI has driven most of the gains on the S&P 500this year — but disagreement over whether that’s pushed the market into bubble territory. Lenders who funneled cash into the data-center rollout have begun to seek hedges. Oaktree Capital Management LP’s Howard Marks plunged into the debate this week, calling the AI risk to employment “terrifying.” Economists are scouring the data — which is patchy, thanks to the long government shutdown – for early signs of where the AI economy is ultimately headed, for better or worse. That could show up as faster productivity growth, or AI-driven job cuts, or strains on the electrical system, though it’s likely too soon to be sure. In both political parties there’s a sense that more thought-out AI strategies will be needed – but neither of them has one right now, according to another Trump adviser, who calls AI a “political football.” Leading Democrats like Virginia Senator Mark Warner and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have cited the need for lawmakers to respond faster to the pace of change without offering much in the way of policy proposals. Democratic candidates who won governorship contests in Virginia and New Jersey promised steps to shield households from higher power prices driven by data centers. In the coming weeks, the White House is expected to release a much-anticipated executive order on expanding the US electric grid. It will include measures focused on bolstering transmission capacity and enhancing grid technology, according to a person who’s been briefed on drafts. Politically the message is far simpler: The administration is trying to show it’s doing all it can to boost power output in the hope of bringing down prices. And it’s redoubled the effort after Democratic ballot wins in November, amid expectations that data centers will consume more energy and keep pushing electricity prices up. Gene Sperling, a former National Economic Council director and adviser to former President Joe Biden, sees a similarity with the 2024 election campaign. Biden and then his deputy, Kamala Harris, campaigned hard on the big-money investments in electric cars and clean energy their policies had delivered. But voter anxieties about the cost of living helped swing the election to Trump. There might be a lesson there on AI for Republicans heading into 2026, Sperling told Bloomberg TV. “You would let people know, ‘Hey, we want to lead in AI, we want to beat China,’” he said. “But we also want to do it in a way that you’re not seeing people make hundreds of millions of dollars while your electricity costs are going up.”

Broadcom shares fell nearly 5% after earnings despite strong AI-driven revenue. Investors reacted to lower expected margins from AI systems and sky-high expectations. Oracle’s weak outlook added pressure, but analysts say Broadcom’s $73B backlog and soaring custom-chip demand still support multi-quarter AI growth.

Business An exterior view of the Oracle Field Office at Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo NEW YORK, Dec 12 : The red-hot trade backing artificial intelligence-related stocks has taken a bruising from back-to-back troubling updates from Oracle and Broadcom, reigniting concerns about frothy valuations and an AI bubble. Still, investors say reasons for optimism about AI remain intact, and many are wary about calling a top. Investors have piled into AI-related companies this year as the technology has taken off, with promises to make Corporate America more efficient. But some investors feel AI-related shares are overvalued. High-profile names such as Michael Burry have been bearish, comparing the recent AI boom to the 1990s dot-com era. For now, however, short-selling has been limited to smaller companies, with few pressing bearish bets against the biggest AI names.

Title: Tech stocks tumble amid renewed AI worries on Wall Street

Time Published: 2025-12-11T22:55:51Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As tech companies push the stock market to record highs, fears of an artificial intelligence bubble continue to simmer on Wall Street, where even a slight earnings miss threatens to upend high-flying stocks. On Thursday, Oracle was the latest company to experience that firsthand. Oracle shares closed down nearly 11% on Thursday after the company announced revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. That wiped nearly $70 billion off the company's market value in a matter of hours. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only major index to close lower, because of tremors in the market made by Oracle. The S&P 500 ended the day at a record high, as did the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Oracle also announced Wednesday night that its spending for fiscal 2026 would be $15 billion more than its estimate in September. The company's total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 are set to be $50 billion. Many of those expenses will be driven by contracts with the likes of Meta and Nvidia, Oracle said. It also said it had a backlog of signed contracts with customers worth $523 billion. Long known for dull back-office software systems, Oracle this year found a renewed purpose as a provider of cloud computing services for the AI boom. But Oracle's share-price drop Thursday had a ripple effect on other top AI stocks for most of the day. Nvidia shares dropped almost 1.5%, while chipmakers Arm Holdings and Intel slid more than 3%. Google owner Alphabet dropped 2.4%. Data center operator CoreWeave and other chipmakers, like AMD and Micron, also dipped into the red. As Oracle's spending rises on the back of AI deals — which some consider "circular" — the company's credit default swaps have soared. The swaps, or CDSes, can be a proxy to gauge how risky a company's bonds or debt are. After Oracle's earnings report Wednesday, they soared to the highest level since 2009, according to Bloomberg, which cited data from the exchange operator ICE. Oracle's credit default swaps have become a closely tracked measure among investors and a barometer for the state of the AI industry overall. On Wednesday night's call, Oracle's principal financial officer, Doug Kehring, said the company is "committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating." "Investment grade" is a rating given to a company's bonds or credit on a sliding scale. Anything below investment-grade is considered speculative, also often referred to as junk. Earlier Thursday, Oracle declined as much as 16.5%, which would have put it on track for its worst one-day performance since 2001. With the S&P 500 up more than 16% and the Nasdaq Composite up more than 20% for the year, the market broadly remains in good shape. Still, the nature and the size of the AI deals — and their uncertain returns — are leading some to question whether the investment boom portends an upcoming bust. Part of those valuations comes from an increasingly complex, interconnected web of deals as AI companies invest in one another. Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI have all announced various investment deals worth tens of billions. In September, chipmaker Nvidia announced a deal to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. But Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said this month that "we still haven't completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them." The comments underscored how much distance there is between a splashy investment announcement and a binding contractual obligation. At the same time Oracle's shares decline, so do the fortunes of the company's majority shareholder, Larry Ellison. Ellison, ranked as the world's second-richest person by Bloomberg Billionaires, has a fortune worth more than $280 billion. Ellison's son, David, is making a hostile $108 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, trying to upend an agreement Warner Bros. already has to sell its movie studios and HBO to streaming giant Netflix. David Ellison is backstopping his bid with the family's fortune, which rests in large part on shares of Oracle. Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Oracle shares fall 14% on increase in data centre spending

Oracle stock slumped after it reported disappointing revenues on Wednesday alongside a $15 billion (€12.8 billion) increase in its planned spending on data centres this year to serve artificial intelligence groups. Shares in Larry Ellison’s database company fell 14 per cent on Thursday. The move came as Oracle reported revenues of $16.1 billion in the last quarter, up 14 per cent from the previous year but below analysts’ estimates. Oracle raised its forecast for capital expenditure this financial year by more than 40 per cent to $50 billion. The outlay, largely directed to building data centres, climbed to $12 billion in the quarter, above expectations of $8.4 billion. Its long-term debt including operating leases increased to $116.3 billion, up 44 per cent from a year ago. Oracle has launched an aggressive drive to catch up with much larger cloud players such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in the race to supply the vast amount of computing power that AI groups including OpenAI and Anthropic need to train and run their models. [ Oracle’s share price surge suggests the AI trade still has momentumOpens in new window ] Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said its cloud contracts would “quickly add revenue and margin to our infrastructure business” as he defended the vast investments. Yet the company said it expected full-year revenues to remain unchanged from its previous forecast of $67 billion. It expected to generate $4 billion more in revenue the following fiscal year. Total bookings for future revenue, known as remaining performance obligations, rose 15 per cent to $523 billion in the three months to the end of November, supported by deals with Meta and Nvidia. Investors initially welcomed the push into AI from Oracle. Shares surged after its last earnings in September when it disclosed it had added more than $300 billion in bookings, largely driven by data centre contracts with OpenAI. But the stock has given up its gains since then as investors worry about the large amounts Oracle will have to borrow and spend on infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker — and concerns over the start-up’s ability to pay for these contracts in the years ahead. Debt investors have also soured on the company. Oracle’s Big Tech rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have helped reassure investors about their large capital investments by posting strong earnings from their vast cloud units. But in the last quarter, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which includes its data centres, posted worse than expected revenues of $4.1 billion. Ellison’s company is also relying more heavily on debt to fuel its expansion. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

Title: Broadcom Shares Down 3% Thursday After Oracle's Earnings Disappoint

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast. In the Podcast, we break down the biggest news in AI each week and issue AI recommendations for our $500,000 AI Portfolio. One of our better recommendations: buying shares of Broadcom on October 11, 2024, and buying more on December 6, 2024. Those two recommendations are up 125% and 127%. Other great recommendations we’ve made include Credo (up 455%), Lumentum (339%), Ciena (243%), and SK Hynix (up 163%). We’ve embedded our latest episode below. Subscribing is absolutely free.

Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Tiger teeth, dried seahorses and shark fins sold illegally on Facebook, BBC finds
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce91072g59no
Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:01:53Z
Full Content:
Endangered species, including tiger body parts, shark fins and pangolin scales, are being offered for sale on Facebook, BBC News has found. One Chinese user posted videos of a tiger in a cage that was for sale as well as pictures of tiger bones and teeth, while another included two live tiger cubs in a box. An image showed a tiger head and bones for sale piled up on scales. A seller told the BBC his products "can be shipped to the UK". He said a 10cm-long tooth would cost 2,000 Chines yuan (about £213) and that he could sell me tiger bones for 3,600 yuan per kilo (about £380). Another seller, who was offering shark fins, claimed to ship from the US to the UK and charged $50 per kilo (about £37). The sale of endangered species such as tigers and pangolin is illegal in the UK and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, closely regulates international trade in species under threat. The voluntary agreement, signed by more than 180 countries and other bodies, only allows the trade if it is both legal and sustainable. It comes as Interpol has announced the results of a global crackdown on the wildlife trade, which it says led to the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals. Meta, which owns Facebook, says it does not allow the sale of endangered species and removes such content. The UK has strict laws on what species can be imported legally. However, BBC News also found British companies selling dried seahorses, which can only be traded in the UK if the seller can certify they were sustainably harvested. In practice, that's not possible and supplying them is likely to break the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, punishable by a fine or prison sentence. One seller was found promoting them as a tonic for mothers who have just given birth and as a medicine for combating coughs. There is no scientific evidence to support this. When contacted, the seller - based in the north of England - immediately sent pictures of the seahorses they had in stock. Ordering online cost just over £60. Two days after placing the order three packets containing 15 dead, dried seahorses arrived in the post. The delivery had no documentation about the origin of the specimens but did include a recipe on how to make soup with them. The BBC showed the samples to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, who said it "made him sick to his stomach". He said they could only have been supplied illegally. Three pregnant males were among the order - male seahorses carry as many as 200 young. Mr Garrick-Maidment says that, kilo for kilo, seahorses are currently worth as much as silver and warned further price rises could mean they are fished to extinction. The global trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth £17bn per year and Interpol assesses it to be the fourth largest international crime type behind drugs smuggling, people smuggling and arms trafficking. The pangolin, which is the only mammal completely covered in scales, has become the most trafficked animal on earth and is now critically endangered. A seller in Laos was found to be offering pangolin scales for sale on Facebook. He told the BBC he charged $150 per kilo. One user even offered to sell rhino horn and suggested making contact via private message. In a statement, Meta said: "We do not allow the sale of endangered species on our platforms." The social media platform says it takes down that kind of material as soon as it becomes aware of it, saying it encourages users to "report any content they think may violate our policies". Today Interpol announced the result of Operation Thunder, a month-long global initiative to combat the trade in endangered species. Authorities in 134 countries were involved in the operation which included the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals and 30 tonnes of animal parts. Interpol says the growth in live animal seizures is driven by the exotic pet trade, but the market in bushmeat is also on the rise. Kenyan authorities seized 400kg of giraffe meat as part of the global crackdown and, in Belgium, primate flesh was found. More than 4,000 shark fins were also intercepted. Danny Hewitt, Border Force's director for UK command operations who oversaw the British arm of Op Thunder, said there had been a 73% increase in seizures compared to 2023. That included live snakes, tarantulas and lovebirds found hidden in vehicles stopped at the UK border. As populations move to the UK they drive demand, he added. The trade has been driven by organised crime, and in many cases, customers who don't understand the harm they are doing. Mr Hewitt added: "They may not have been illegal in other parts of the world, but they are illegal in the UK." At the end of 2024, Keir Starmer announced key government targets including on NHS waiting lists and building new homes, how is he getting on? Here are the year's breakthroughs for the climate and nature you might have missed. A historical site dating back to the last Saxon king is being revitalised. Seal pups and jellyfish-like organisms are among the creatures washed up on Dorset's beaches. California's governor Gavin Newsom issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order.

UPDATED 18:50 EST / DECEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped more than 10% in extended trading today after the cloud and database giant missed expectations on quarterly revenue while going full-steam ahead on its ongoing artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout. The company reported second-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.26 per share, easily beating Wall Street’s target of $1.64 per share. However, though revenue grew by 16% from a year earlier, to $16.06 billion, it fell short of the $16.21 billion analyst estimate. In terms of profitability, Oracle showed a big improvement, with net income of $6.14 billion in the quarter, up from just $3.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. However, the company’s guidance was perhaps a tad discouraging for investors. Oracle executives said they’re looking for earnings of between $1.70 and $1.74 in the third-quarter, which is only in-line with the Street’s forecast of $1.72. The company also called for revenue growth of between 19% and 21% versus the Street’s $16.87 billion estimate, which implies 19% growth. Oracle said it delivered $7.98 billion in cloud revenue during the quarter, above the $7.92 billion consensus estimate. Within that segment, cloud infrastructure revenue came to $4.1 billion, up 68% from a year ago. Today was the first quarterly earnings call by Oracle’s new co-Chief Executive Officers Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, who took over the job from former CEO Safra Catz in September. In a call with analysts, Sicilia highlighted a number of new cloud infrastructure customer wins with companies including Airbus, Deutsche Bank, LSEG, Panasonic, Canon and Rubrik. Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann told SiliconANGLE that it’s quite telling that Sicilia felt the need to highlight so many customer wins during the call. “The market has been really nervous about Oracle’s overreliance on OpenAI and other AI plays from a RPO and forecast perspective, so this litany of customer wins and apps growth acceleration shows some welcome diversity,” she said. Oracle’s software business didn’t fare so well, however, with revenue declining 3%, to $5.88 billion, falling short of the Street’s $6.06 billion estimate. On the other hand, Oracle’s future does look promising, with the company pointing to remaining performance obligations that soared 438% from a year ago, to a staggering $523 billion. RPO, as the metric is known, refers to contracted revenue that has not yet been realized, and is really a measure of the company’s enormous backlog of orders, mostly for cloud infrastructure capacity. Wall Street had been forecasting RPO of $501.8 billion. Oracle Principle Financial Officer Doug Kehring said on the call that the increase was the result of new commitments by customers including Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp. and others, and told analysts that the company is hoping to be able to convert this revenue sooner than expected. “This is good news for Oracle and its capex story,” Wettemann said, referring to Oracle’s runaway capital expenditures. The company has been trying to position itself at the center of the AI boom by committing to a massive data center buildout, and expects capex to increase to $50 billion this year, up from $21.2 billion in the previous fiscal year. While the increased capex has boosted the company’s revenue and backlog, some investors have become worried about the enormous amounts of debt it has taken on to fund its investments. Much of Oracle’s backlog stems from OpenAI Group PBC, which has committed to spending more than $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure services over the next five years. “The longer the backlog sits there, the greater the risk that Oracle can’t monetize it, or the AI landscape changes enough that certain customers can’t pay on their commitments,” Wettemann explained. Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller said some eagle-eyed investors may have noted that Oracle’s growing revenue is coming at a steep cost, resulting in lower profitability as it generates more sales. “The problem is that the $2 billion in cloud revenue growth only translated to around half a billion in operating income,” the analyst said. “At the same time, Oracle keeps spending like a drunken sailor on capex and is cash flow-negative by $13 billion. While this could end up great if AI pans out, it could also become a problem.” Kehring tried to reassure investors, telling analysts on the call that the company remains committed to maintaining its investment-grade debt rating. “There are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,” he said. “Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.” Mueller agreed that the debt Oracle has been taking on isn’t a problem. “With interest payments at approximately $1 billion, the debt load is more than manageable for the company,” he said. The company said its earnings during the quarter were boosted by a $2.7 billion pretax gain on the sale of its interest in chip design business Ampere, which is set to be acquired by SoftBank Group Corp. for $6.5 billion. Oracle announced the sale in March. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison (pictured), who remains the company’s most influential executive, said the decision to sell Ampere was taken because he thinks it no longer makes sense to continue designing, manufacturing and using its own chips in its data centers. “The company is committed to a policy of chip neutrality,” he said. “[It needs] to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy.” The earnings call comes on the back of a 23% drop in Oracle’s share price last month, its worst monthly performance since 2021. But although the stock declined further today, it’s still up more than 33% in the year to date, ahead of the broader, technology-focused Nasdaq index, which has gained just 22% this year.

Business Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan makes a speech on stage in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. REUTERS/Ann Wang SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 : When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEOIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGYTan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.”According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITALSoon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova.Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUPIn 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications.In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said.Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.

Title: Algorithms and Capitalism: Cleaning Up The Waze Parade

John Battelle's Search Blog Thoughts on the intersection of tech, business, and society. Do you feel it? A simmering discontent with the state of capitalism in American life? I certainly do. My kids engage with social media only if they have to – never because they wish to. They believe their feeds are manipulated by corporate interests, and they are distrustful of anyone who believes otherwise. My wife is convinced that anything she buys online – particularly the bigger ticket items like flights or hotels – is priced based on what algorithms calculate she can afford to pay – not what might be fair or offered to others. Parents in my friend group are terrified that their kids are using ChatGPT as a confidante and therapist whose motivations are unfathomable. The stock market keeps pushing ever upwards, but my colleagues are increasingly convinced a crash is around the corner. Something just feels….off. The complex socio-economic system that we’re all a part of seems rigged. And we feel powerless to do anything about it. Two news items from the past few days underscore this gloomy sensibility. From the Times comes this gem: Same Product, Same Store, but on Instacart, Prices Might Differ. Here’s the takeaway: digital aggregators like Instacart (and Uber, and Expedia, etc.) use a sophisticated combination of data, algorithms, and AI to extract as much profit as they can from each and every consumer with which they interact. It’s called dynamic pricing, and it’s an inevitable consequence of capitalism colliding with the digital economy. Turns out, my wife was right. The second item offering proof that something’s rotten in the state of capitalism comes courtesy of 404 Media, which uncovered some downright insidious behavior from Meta’s Instagram (I know, shocking!). In short, Instagram is creating AI-generated content based on its own users’ posts, then injecting that content into Google so as to drive more traffic back to Instagram. It’s a perfect example of “growth hacking,” a practice that Meta/Facebook perfected more than ten years ago. Turns out, my kids were right to not trust their social media feeds. What connects these two stories is how the “customer” is treated by tech platforms. The Instagram user whose posts are being distorted in pursuit of traffic, the Instacart consumer who sees a price driven by extractive algorithms – they’re being manipulated by forces they can’t see or understand. In short, they’re being treated like commodified inputs to a system, not valued customers who might have a choice as to where they shop or spend their time. They’re being taken for granted. Have you ever found yourself part of a “Waze parade,” blindly following the algorithm’s increasingly complicated instructions through suburban streets just to save a few seconds of time on your way to your destination? It kind of feels like that’s happening everywhere now, across every digital surface that’s intermediated by a profit-seeking technology company. We know it sucks, but hell, we’re already way off the highway and deep in unfamiliar territory, so let’s just keep making those lefts and rights, and hope we get there, right? Is there a way out of this algorithmic prison? I’m not sure, but I sense personal AI agents – ones that work only for us – could be a big part of the solution. I’ve written recently about the problems facing personal agents, and heard back from someone who’s working on those problems via a “loyal agents” consortium led by Consumer Reports, amongst others. They call their work “conscious commerce” – and I’m cheering for their success. From a recent post: If agentic commerce is built the way the internet works today, we’ll get an economy even more by advertising and other perverse incentives—one where your buying decisions are based on obscure deals between online retailers and AI companies, where all the intimate conversations you share flow into an ad platform, and where manipulative AI chatbots whisper in your ear over the months to spend more, or more foolishly. It doesn’t have to be that way. If we’re intentional, we can use this moment to build something much more consumer-centric—an economy where consumers have more power than ever before.

Title: Will Meta Platforms (META) Stock Hit $1,000 in 2027?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Derick Hudson / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Guided by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a business seeking a direction. Is Meta Platforms a social media giant, a metaverse pioneer, or an artificial intelligence (AI) technology trailblazer? Some investors have expressed disappointment about the performance of Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs metaverse/virtual reality (VR) business unit. On the other hand, Meta Platforms has more than 4 billion eyeballs on its social media applications globally. Thus, Meta Platforms is a force to be reckoned with and META stock could be poised for significant upside. In an optimistic scenario, the Meta Platforms share price could even reach $1,000 by the end of 2027 — but don’t place any bets until you’ve reviewed the catalysts and concerns. Since 2025 is nearly over, we can assess the year’s performance of Meta Platforms stock. The shares are up 11% year to date and are only up 5% over the past 12 months. That’s a decent performance, but it’s nothing to write home about. Frankly, META stock hasn’t been so magnificent lately even though Meta Platforms is a member of the Magnificent Seven. To hit $1,000 by the end of 2027, Meta Platforms stock would have to rise 54% from its current price of approximately $650. Even with a strong finish in December of this year, META stock would need to gain around 25% in 2026 and another 25% in 2027. At least, we can say that Meta Platforms stock looks reasonably valued after a decent but not spectacular 2025. At the moment, Meta Platforms has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.79x, which isn’t excessive for a mega-cap technology firm. While it doesn’t appear to be over-valued, Meta Platforms will still need to demonstrate robust financial growth for META stock to reach $1,000. So, let’s take a glance at the most recent quarterly data and analyze Meta Platforms’s growth trajectory. Here are the need-to-know data points. In the third quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ total revenue grew 26.2% year over year to $51.242 billion versus $40.589 billion in the year-earlier quarter. As usual, the majority of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.082 billion for Q3 2025) came from the company’s Advertising segment. Looking at it from another angle, nearly all of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.772 billion) was derived from the company’s “Family of Apps” (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). Suffice it to say, then, that app-based advertisements continue to be Meta Platforms’ bread and butter. Turning to the company’s bottom-line results, Meta Platforms’ net income declined 82.7% from $15.688 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $2.709 billion in Q3 2025. This occurred despite Meta Platforms aforementioned revenue growth. There’s no need to panic about this, though, as Meta Platforms’ year-on-year net income decline may just be a one-time tax-accounting issue. As it turns out, the company’s “provision for income taxes” jumped from $2.134 billion in 2024’s third quarter to $18.954 billion in the third quarter of 2025. The critics may be willing to overlook Meta Platforms’ steep net income drop-off, but there’s another possible objection. In particular, they could complain that Meta Platforms relies heavily on social media app ad revenue. That may be the case, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to expand Meta Platforms into new, intriguing technology fields. Will the CEO’s bold vision be a boon for Meta Platforms, though? After multiple quarters of operating losses from Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs division, investors may be relieved to see Zuckerberg shifting his attention to AI instead of the metaverse. Lately, there’s been talk about Meta Platforms possibly gearing up to introduce next-generation AI glasses next year. However, Meta Platforms will need to effectively parlay its legions of app users into a loyal base of AI tech consumers. Until that happens, Meta Platforms’ foray into AI technology will be quite costly. From 2024’s third quarter to Q3 2025, Meta Platforms’ research and development expenses ramped up 35.5%, from $11.177 billion to $15.144 billion. Plus, there are no signs that Meta Platforms’ spending spree will end anytime soon. Just this year, Meta Platforms expects to have spent a mind-blowing $72 billion on AI technology. Over the next three years, the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure and job investments, presumably to include AI tech development. It’s a costly pivot, and there’s no assurance that Meta Platforms will convert its millions of eyeballs into enthusiastic AI glasses wearers. Remember, Meta Platforms tried to get consumers to wear VR headsets but that didn’t work out as planned. Meta Platforms can rely on its massive app advertising revenue for growth, but the next chapter in the company’s story hasn’t been written yet. Zuckerberg’s AI obsession may turn out to be a costly misstep, just as Reality Labs ended up. Hence, it’s possible but unlikely that META stock will gain 25% in 2026 and then gain another 25% in 2027. Getting Meta Platforms shares to $1,000 is a tall order that would require strong evidence that the company’s spending spree is justified. So far, the proof just isn’t there yet, so investors should stay cautious for now. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: AI Business Deals Are Getting a Bit 2008-ish

The last time so much wealth was tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on December 12, 2025 A company that most people have never heard of is among the year’s best-performing technology firms—and a symbol of the complex, interconnected, and potentially catastrophic ways in which AI companies do business these days. CoreWeave’s IPO in March was the largest of any tech start-up since 2021, and the company’s share price has subsequently more than doubled, outperforming even the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. On Wall Street, CoreWeave is regularly referred to as one of the most important companies powering the AI revolution. In the past few months, it has announced a $22 billion partnership with OpenAI, a $14 billion deal with Meta, and a $6 billion arrangement with Nvidia. Not bad for a former crypto-mining firm turned data-center operator with zero profits and billions of dollars in debt on its books. CoreWeave’s business model consists of buying up lots of high-end computer chips, and building or leasing data centers to house those chips. It then rents out those assets to AI companies that need computing power but prefer not to take on the huge up-front costs themselves. If this is straightforward enough, CoreWeave’s financial situation is anything but. The company expects to bring in $5 billion in revenue this year while spending roughly $20 billion. To cover that gap, the company has taken on $14 billion in debt, nearly a third of which comes due in the next year. Many of these loans were issued by private-equity firms at high interest rates, and several use complex forms of financial engineering, such as giving the money to newly formed legal entities created for the explicit purpose of borrowing on CoreWeave’s behalf (more on that later). CoreWeave also faces $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. From the May 2025 issue: The new king of tech The money that CoreWeave is making, meanwhile, comes from just a few intimately connected sources. A single customer, Microsoft, is responsible for as much as 70 percent of its revenue; its next biggest customers, Nvidia and OpenAI, might make up another 20 percent, though exact numbers are hard to find. Nvidia is also CoreWeave’s supplier of chips and one of its major investors, meaning CoreWeave is using Nvidia’s money to buy Nvidia’s chips and then renting them right back to Nvidia. OpenAI is also a major CoreWeave investor and has close financial partnerships with both Nvidia and Microsoft. All of this might make CoreWeave the purest distillation of a trend sweeping through the AI sector. In recent months, tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle have been making gargantuan investments in new data centers, tying together their fortunes through circular financing deals, and borrowing huge piles of debt from lightly regulated lenders. The companies and their most ardent backers argue that these deals will set them up to capture the limitless profits of the coming AI revolution. But the last time the economy saw so much wealth tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. If the AI revolution fails to materialize on the scale or the timeline that the industry expects, the economic consequences could be very ugly indeed. The extreme financialization of the AI sector reflects a simple reality: The infrastructure required to train and run AI systems is so expensive that not even the largest companies have enough cash to pay for it all. Spending on data centers is conservatively projected to exceed $400 billion this year, roughly the size of the economy of Denmark; McKinsey estimates that it will reach nearly $7 trillion by 2030. Creative measures are necessary to pay for all of this investment. At the center of the action is Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company. Companies that train and run AI systems, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, need Nvidia’s chips but don’t have the cash on hand to pay for them. Nvidia, meanwhile, has plenty of cash but needs customers to keep buying its chips. So the parties have made a series of deals in which the AI companies are effectively paying Nvidia by handing over a share of their future profits in the form of equity. The chipmaker has struck more than 50 deals this year, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI and (with Microsoft) a $15 billion investment in Anthropic. Formally, these transactions don’t obligate the AI companies to spend money on Nvidia’s chips—an Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “does not require any of the companies we invest in to use Nvidia technology”—but in practice, that’s where the money goes. OpenAI has made its own series of deals, including agreements to purchase $300 billion of computing power from Oracle, $38 billion from Amazon, and $22 billion from CoreWeave. Those cloud providers, in turn, are an important market for Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI has also invested in several smaller AI start-ups, which in exchange have agreed to pay for ChatGPT enterprise accounts. Even when represented visually, the resulting web of interlocking relationships is almost impossible to track. Together, these arrangements amount to an entire industry making a double-or-nothing bet on a product that is nowhere near profitable. A single company, OpenAI, is simultaneously a major source of revenue and investment for several cloud companies and chipmakers; a close financial partner to Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon; a significant customer for Nvidia; and a leading investor in AI start-ups. And yet the company is projected to generate only $10 billion this year in revenue—less than a fifth of what it needs annually just to fund its deal with Oracle. It is on track to lose at least $15 billion this year, and doesn’t expect to be profitable until at least 2029. By one estimate, AI companies collectively will generate $60 billion in revenue against $400 billion in spending this year. The one company that is making a lot of money from the AI boom, Nvidia, is doing so only because everyone else is buying its chips in the hopes of obtaining future profits. The AI companies and their boosters see this as a gamble worth taking. Demand for AI services, they point out, is growing at an exponential rate. According to calculations by Azeem Azhar, a widely cited AI-industry analyst, the direct revenues from AI services have increased nearly ninefold over the past two years. If that pace continues, then it’s only a matter of time before AI companies will begin making record-shattering profits. “I think people who fixate on exactly how these investments are being financed are stuck in an outdated way of thinking,” Azhar told me. “Everyone is assuming that this technology will improve at a linear pace. But AI is an exponential technology. It’s a whole different paradigm.” If, however, AI does not produce the short-term profits its proponents envision—if its technical advances slow down and its productivity-enhancing effects underwhelm, as a mounting body of evidence suggests may be the case—then the financial ties that bind the sector together could become everyone’s collective downfall. The extreme concentration of stock-market wealth in a handful of tech companies with deep financial links to one another could make an AI crash even more severe than the dot-com crash of the 2000s. And a stock-market correction might be the least of America’s worries. When equity investments go bad, investors might lose their shirts, but the damage to the real economy is typically contained. (The dot-com crash, for example, didn’t cause mass unemployment.) But the AI build-out is so expensive that it can’t be funded by equity investments alone. To finance their investments, AI companies have taken on hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, a number that Morgan Stanley expects to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2028. When a bunch of highly leveraged loans go bad at the same time, the fallout can spread throughout the financial system and trigger a major recession. The AI sector’s debt is, of course, not guaranteed to go bad. But the complex way in which it is arranged and packaged isn’t reassuring. For instance, earlier this year, Meta decided to build a new data center in Louisiana that will cost $27 billion. Instead of applying for a loan from a traditional lender, the company partnered with Blue Owl Capital, a private-equity firm, to set up a separate legal entity, known as a special-purpose vehicle, or SPV, that will borrow the money on Meta’s behalf, build the data center according to Meta’s instructions, and then lease it back to Meta. Because Blue Owl is technically the majority owner of the project, this setup keeps the debt off of Meta’s balance sheet, enabling the company to keep borrowing at low interest rates without worrying about a hit to its credit rating. Other companies, including xAI, CoreWeave, and Google, have borrowed or plan to borrow huge sums through similar kinds of arrangements. Meta has described its arrangement with Blue Owl as an “innovative partnership” that is “designed to support the speed and flexibility required for Meta’s data center projects.” But the reason the credit-rating system exists is to give lenders and investors a clear sense of the risk they are taking on when they issue a loan. A long history exists of companies trying to circumvent that system. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, several major financial institutions used SPVs to keep billions of dollars in household debt off of their balance sheets. Enron, the energy corporation that famously collapsed in 2001 after a massive accounting scandal, used SPVs to mask its shady accounting practices. “When I see arrangements like this, it’s a huge red flag,” Paul Kedrosky, a managing partner at SK Ventures and research fellow at MIT who has written extensively about financial-engineering techniques, told me. “It sends the signal that these companies really don’t want the credit-rating agencies to look too closely at their spending.” SPVs aren’t the only 2008-era financing tool making a comeback. Data-center debt totaling billions of dollars is being sliced up into “asset-backed securities,” which are then bundled and sold to investors. This is not an inherently problematic way for companies to fund their borrowing. But Kedrosky argues that during periods of heightened speculation, these vehicles turn debt into a financial product whose worth is disconnected from the value of the underlying asset it represents—which can encourage reckless behavior. “Investors see these complex financial products and they say, I don’t care what’s happening inside—I just care that it’s highly rated and promises a big return,” Kedrosky said. “That’s what happened in ’08. And once that kind of thinking takes off, it becomes really dangerous.” Rogé Karma: Just how bad would an AI bubble be? Then there are the so-called GPU-backed loans. Several data-center builders and cloud providers, including CoreWeave, have obtained multibillion-dollar loans to purchase chips by posting their existing chips as collateral, just as many homeowners used their homes as collateral to take out loans for second and third homes in the 2000s. But, as Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise, notes in a recent report on the AI sector’s finances, whether that collateral will hold its value is far from clear. When new chip models are released, the value of older models tends to fall. According to Arun, if the collapse in chip prices were steep enough, a vicious cycle could ensue. As older chips fall in value, any loan using those chips as collateral suddenly becomes at risk of default. Lenders might respond by calling in their loans early, before companies have the revenue to pay them back. At that point, the lender might try to sell the chips to recoup their investment, but that will only flood the market with even more chips, driving down the values of existing chips even further, causing other lenders to call in their loans and so on. “A few months ago I would have told you that this was building toward a repeat of the dot-com crash,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “But all of this debt and financial engineering is making me increasingly worried about a 2008-like scenario.” The federal government responded to the 2008 crisis by limiting the ability of traditional banks to take on big, risky loans. Since then, however, private-equity firms, which aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as banks, have gotten more heavily into the lending business. As of early this year, these firms had lent about $450 billion in so-called private credit to the tech sector, including financing several of the deals discussed above. And, according to one estimate, they will lend it another $800 billion over the next two years. “If the AI bubble goes bust, they are the ones that will be left holding the bag,” Arun told me. A private-credit bust is almost certainly preferable to a banking bust. Unlike banks, private-equity firms don’t have ordinary depositors. In theory, if their loans fail, the groups that will be hurt the most are institutional investors, such as pension funds, university endowments, and hedge funds, limiting the damage to the broader economy. The problem is that nobody knows for certain that this is the case. Private credit is functionally a black box. Unlike banks, these entities don’t have to disclose who they are getting their money from, how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. This makes it impossible for regulators to know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy. Evidence is growing that the links between private credit and the rest of the financial system are stronger than once believed. Careful studies from the Federal Reserve estimate that up to a quarter of bank loans to nonbank financial institutions are now made to private-credit firms (up from just 1 percent in 2013) and that major life-insurance companies have nearly $1 trillion tied up in private credit. These connections raise the prospect that a big AI crash could lead to a wave of private-credit failures, which could in turn bring down major banks and insurers, Natasha Sarin, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in financial regulation, told me. “Unfortunately, it usually isn’t until after a crisis that we realize just how interconnected the different parts of the financial system were all along,” she said. An AI-induced financial disaster is far from inevitable. Still, given the warning signs, one would hope for the federal government to be doing what it can to reduce the risk of a crisis. Instead, the Trump administration is doing the opposite. In August, the president signed an executive order that instructs federal agencies to loosen regulations so that ordinary 401(k) holders can invest directly in “alternative assets” such as, yes, private credit, a change that could expose a far broader swath of the public to the fallout if AI loans go bad. Perhaps that is the key difference between 2008 and 2025. Back then, the federal government was caught off guard by the crash; this time, it appears to be courting one.
