If you've been waiting to buy a new laptop, you're in luck. Some of the best Black Friday laptop deals offer discounts on models suitable for every kind of user from nearly every major brand. As one of Insider Reviews' lead computer experts, I keep a close eye on the laptop market to pick out the best savings. And I've already found sales on fantastic Windows, Mac, and Chromebook laptops. There are a lot of savings to browse, but some of my favorites include nearly $100 off the already-affordable Acer Aspire Go, $200 off the powerful 2025 MacBook Pro M5, and 25% off the 13-inch MacBook Air. You have a lot more options in addition to these, ranging from travel-friendly Chromebooks to RGB gaming rigs. Keep an eye on this article for updated Black Friday laptop deals as they come in, and head to our roundup of Black Friday coverage to see all of the top discounts our team finds throughout the event. There are more Windows laptops on the market than any other kind of laptop. This means that you've got a lot of choices, and it's not hard to find great deals. I'm seeing discounts on laptops across the price spectrum, ranging from high-end gaming models to budget beasts. The Acer Inspire Go is a solid option for users on a budget. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price. The Acer Swift Go 14 AI is a thin laptop with a bright screen, fast processor, and unbelievably long battery life. Its power and longevity make it great for students and workers who need a laptop they can take on the go. MacBooks were once infamous for their high prices. However, in the modern day, MacBooks aren't actually any more expensive than PC laptops with the same hardware; PC laptop prices have increased, while MacBook prices have remained relatively stable. And on Black Friday, these premium laptops become even more affordable than usual. The newest MacBook Air models feature an M4 chip, which is one of the most powerful ever included in an Apple computer. Its speed, combined with a sleek design and beautiful screen, makes it a top-tier laptop. This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage. With all the "Mac vs. PC" hubbub, it's easy to forget about the third major player in the laptop market: Chromebooks. They're not as customizable or versatile as other laptops, but they do win in one department: Affordability. If all you need in a laptop is the ability to browse the web, check your email, watch YouTube, and maybe edit some photos, a Chromebook could be a better choice than an expensive Mac or PC — especially on Black Friday, when those affordable prices drop even lower. Chromebooks are solid options for buyers on a budget, and this affordable model from HP has decent specs for casual users. This budget Chromebook offers more memory and storage than most models, along with a bigger keyboard. It's a very affordable option perfect for budget-minded students and workers. Rather than invest in a bulky and pricey traditional gaming PC, a good gaming laptop is a solid option for smooth performance and portability. They're still not necessarily cheap, but finding one on sale for Black Friday can save you hundreds that would be better spent on peripherals like a reliable headset or lightweight mouse. All three operating systems have their pros and cons. But the large majority of buyers should stick with a Windows or Mac laptop. Windows laptops are remarkably versatile, capable of running more programs, playing more games, and opening a wider range of file types than any other operating system. They're also infinitely more customizable on both the hardware and software levels: Dozens of new PC laptops come out every year, and Windows offers loads of internal settings you can use to manage your computing experience. It's the operating system of choice if you want to have the most control over your laptop. MacBooks, meanwhile, place a greater emphasis on ensuring your computing experience is as smooth as possible. There aren't many settings you can edit, you'll install most programs through a streamlined app store, and viruses are nearly non-existent. It doesn't support as many programs as Windows does, but most users won't encounter any issues with this. If you want a laptop that just works without requiring any effort on your part, consider a MacBook. I wouldn't recommend a Chromebook to anyone except the most minimalist of laptop users. Chromebooks are essentially designed for one thing: Letting you surf the web. Sure, they can run some media editing software and support Google Gemini, but other operating systems can do that better. If all you need from your laptop is a basic internet connection, a Chromebook might be the right choice. Different laptop models fluctuate in price over the year. But in general, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times to buy laptops. This is because, like cars, laptop manufacturers tend to release new models each year. At the end of the year, retailers aim to clear out their stock to make room for the new models. This often leads to record-low prices. It's mostly branding. There's nothing a "gaming" laptop can't do that an everyday laptop can't, and that's mostly true the other way around, too. "Gaming" tends to be another word for "high-end." Gaming laptops typically feature brighter displays, more powerful graphics cards, and higher RAM capacities than laptops that lack the "gaming" branding. In exchange, though, they're usually more expensive and heavier. In short, a great gaming laptop is also a great everyday laptop. If you want the absolute best laptop money can buy, consider a gaming laptop, even if you've never touched a video game in your life. Shopping for more discounts today?

Several top AI chipmakers lost ground as a potential deal between two Big Tech giants underscored competitive pressures in the market. Meanwhile, shares of an electronics retailer moved higher after a strong quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes rose for the third straight session as investors grew increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its December meeting. The Dow rose 1.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.9%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.7% higher. See here for more from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) shares jumped 10% to log Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of electronic test and measurement solutions topped quarterly earnings estimates. The company's sales outlook came in ahead of expectations, boosted by strong demand from AI data centers. Keysight also announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Shares of companies exposed to the housing market extended their recent rise amid growing optimism about a cut in interest rates, which would lead to lower mortgage rates. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) stock surged close to 9% Tuesday, adding to solid gains posted by the residential construction materials supplier in the prior session. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected same-store sales, revenue, and adjusted profit for the third quarter, and its shares powered over 5% higher. The company also raised its full-year outlook, pointing to consumer resilience as well as gains in the computer, tablet, and gaming categories as customers upgrade and replace older devices. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped nearly 3% following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is evaluating using AI chips from Google. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed close to 2% to finish at a fresh high. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock lost 3.7% after the parent of its namesake fruit spreads, Jif peanut butter, and Folgers coffee released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Although sales for the period edged out forecasts and adjusted profit matched expectations, Smucker's full-year profit outlook disappointed. The company has raised its coffee prices as it navigates tariff pressures but said it would refrain from additional price hikes this winter after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.

Title: Why the GenAI Infrastructure Boom May Break Historical Patterns

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom—usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won. GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend: First, as I discuss in my prior post, the chips powering today’s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial—Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors’ assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s—much of it still in use today—enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon’s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure—shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth—but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. As I’ve discussed here previously, the chips powering today’s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the “GPU treadmill”—namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships—they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage—more cargo meant higher bills—but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge “reasonable and just” rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn’t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI’s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this “success” would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using “walled gardens” that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions—infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others’ applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or “sherlocking” the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the “brain” of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic—the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis—resides within the infrastructure provider’s model, not the customer’s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to “renting cognition,” allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft’s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence—they’re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized “spillover” benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

After a number of fumbles as Google struggled to get its own chatbot out the door, some of the closest Google watchers were calling for CEO Sundar Pichai to step down. Nearly three years later, Google has performed a miraculous turnaround. Its new AI model, Gemini 3, is proving such a win that Marc Benioff said he's switching from ChatGPT. Google has just surpassed Microsoft's market cap and is on its way to a $4 trillion status. Its stock price is up nearly 70% this year. It's a signal that Google — which has always held the various pieces to compete — has finally got everything working in harmony, all the way from the models up to the platforms like Search that put them in users' hands. In the fast-moving AI race, no victory is secure — but Google has never looked stronger. Here's why. Gemini 3 rolled out to the public last week with rave reviews. It outperforms its predecessor in coding, design, and analysis, and surpasses competing models in benchmark tests. As we at Business Insider discovered, it's highly adept at designing websites and basic video games, giving it broader use beyond coding. The new model has allayed some fears that Google was too far behind rivals and that scaling laws — rules that say AI models improve with more data and compute — were slowing down. The company's stock price has increased by more than 12% since the rollout of Gemini 3 on November 18. Google has spent over a decade developing its own chips for internal use. Known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google has used these chips to train its Gemini models. That's a great advertisement as Google hopes more companies will adopt the chips for their own models. Google sells access to its TPUs through its cloud business and has made a significant internal push in recent months to attract more customers. That could pose a long-term threat to Nvidia's business. Google is currently in discussions for a blockbuster deal with Meta worth billions of dollars, which would potentially host some of Google's chips in one of Meta's own data centers, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Information first reported on the arrangement, which sent the shares of chip companies like AMD and Nvidia tumbling on Tuesday. In September, a federal judge handed down penalties for an antitrust lawsuit brought against Google's search business in 2020. Those penalties, which threatened to tear up Google's lucrative search empire, amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist. Google was told it could continue making payments to partners such as Apple for default status, but could not do so exclusively. It was also ordered to share some search data with rivals. At one point, Google's Chrome browser was on the chopping block, which could have severed a crucial part of Google's search-advertising flywheel. Despite the judge ruling that Google had acted as a monopoly, the company came away relatively unscathed. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway built a $4.3 billion stake in Google parent company Alphabet last quarter, a regulatory filing revealed. That's notable for two reasons. Other than Apple, Buffett has tended to avoid tech stocks. He has also historically avoided expensive, high-growth companies. As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO, the decision to finally bet on Google — something he said he wished he'd done long ago — suggests strong confidence in the search giant. Google's core moneymaker is still search advertising, and one of the big investor fears has been how Google's self-disruption might hurt its cash cow. Not a lot, apparently: Search revenues jumped 15% in the third quarter, suggesting that even if AI is hurting some websites' traffic, it's not harming Google's business. In fact, Google says generative AI is causing people to search more than ever. The company is currently testing ads in AI Mode, its chatbot-like version of search that is gradually feeling like less of an experiment and more like Google's vision for how search will eventually work.

Title: The Reset: Your Hollywood Guide to an AI Bubble Burst

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Who’s most exposed when the AI rally finally comes to an end? What you’re missing: The Reset is a newsletter we send out every Sunday to the corporate enterprise subscribers to WrapPRO. If you think your company or organization would be interested in signing up for an enterprise plan, please reach out to our head of enterprise sales, Kimberly Donnan, at kimberly.donnan@thewrap.com. Happy Sunday, Part of any daily dialogue these days seems to include the argument over whether we are in an AI bubble. The sentiment changes almost hourly while the camp of of not if but when is picking up momentum. But it’s a rollercoaster. SoftBank selling its nearly $6 billion stake in Nvidia fueled bubble theories, but Nvidia’s knockout quarter reported on Wednesday seemed to shut those down — for now. The analysts’ estimates vary widely projecting that from 40% to as much as 75% of the stock market’s gains this year are attributable to AI-related equities. Either way, it’s substantial. This chart from Bank of America Global Research highlights the ongoing concerns of fund managers through a new November survey. Hollywood and the larger media sector have had a love-hate relationship with AI so far, which begs the question that if we are indeed in a bubble and that bubble bursts, how bad will it hurt business? Here’s a few thoughts on those with the most exposure: Netflix — A robust early adopter of AI for content personalization, dubbing, localizing programming, and automated trailer production has high exposure. Those tools depend on early-stage AI vendors that would get crushed if a bubble burst. Bottom line is that localization efforts, key to building sub growth outside U.S., would get more expensive. Disney — With its internal efforts at integrating AI stalling, Disney is increasingly looking at partners to help with production and VFX. It’s also beginning to use AI-driven personalization and robotics at its parks. A bubble burst would mean fewer outside options to fully take advantage of the capabilities of AI. Warner Bros. Discovery — AI isn’t much of a presence at WBD beyond the promise of the technology cutting costs from everything to marketing to production. WBD is pitching as positive a narrative as it can to Wall Street right now as it shops itself. The bubble bursting would kill that narrative, but presumably CEO David Zaslav would have sold the company already. Sony — Sony Animation and Crunchyroll are testing AI-dependent localization and subtitling pipelines. Its gigantic gaming division is experimenting with AI in the creative process, especially at the intersection of film and TV IP. What’s more, VFX shops, like Framestore, Weta FX and DNEG, are getting help from AI on so-called rotoscoping, upscaling and simulation. Same story: This kind of help comes from startups that would be wiped out in a bubble burst. It’s worth considering, too, the growing divergence between AI stocks and consumer sentiment, as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip pointed out last week, highlighted by this chart. The so-called Magnificent Seven include Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla. Stepping back, an AI bubble burst would not kill innovation in Hollywood, to be clear. But it will be a setback and likely force the delay of any planned technology rollouts. One upside, I guess, is that a bubble burst might take some of the tension out of labor relations that have been rocky since AI arrived on the scene. Enjoy your Thanksgiving and see you back here next Sunday. Tom LowrySenior Vice President/Editorial Strategytom.lowry@thewrap.com 1. U.S. Political Divide Revealed on Social A recent survey from Statista Consumer Insights reflects pretty much the U.S. political divide on an even basis. Some light differences do show up in the survey conducted between October 2024 and this past September; Facebook is where centrists feel most at home. X is where partisanship is most visible, with more users leaning right. No surprises there. LinkedIn also leans more right with its more business-focused user base. Reddit is the one platform of those included in the survey that leans left. BlueSky, which was created at a time when Elon Musk took control of the old Twitter, was not included in the survey. 2. Streaming’s Sticker Shock We all feel the weight of subscriptions we are carrying but this chart fromLeverage Shares brings it all home. It shows the price changes for the most popular streaming services since 2019, with Disney+ topping the list at 172% inflation, a factor that probably made it easier for subscribers to drop the service over parent company’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The inflation gives you pause to remember that streaming was created, in part, to be the low-cost alternative to traditional pay platforms like cable and satellite. But content is expensive and growth slows, and streamers feel like they’ve got the pricing power. But for how long? The work of determining the fate of Warner Bros. Discovery begins in earnest now. With bids submitted at Thursday’s deadline, let the due diligence begin. CEO David Zaslav will no doubt be leaning heavily on a team of advisors, no one more so than Paul Gould, the veteran investment banker with Allen & Co., one of the firms WBD hired to navigate a potential sale or split of the company. Allen & Co. has been advising media companies for more than half a century and Gould has been part of the team there since 1972. He is also an independent director on the WBD board, and has a long history of working with one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, billionaire cable mogul John Malone. The boutique investment bank is probably best-known for hosting its annual gathering of media, entertainment and tech executives every July in Sun Valley, Idaho. Gould is a fixture there. The confab has become known as the “billionaire’s summer camp.” But unlike the outsized personalities of the executives he serves, Gould is happy behind the scenes and famously press shy. In fact, the only photo we could find of him is the above picture from Sun Valley more than 10 years ago, walking alongside Malone. Gould has been an advisor on thousands of deals over the decades. Allen’s recent record includes the AT&T / Time Warner deal in 2016, advising Time Warner in its $108 billion acquisition by AT&T; advising Activision in 2022 in the nearly $70 billion acquisition by Microsoft; the firm advised on the 2015 separation of eBay and PayPal, a deal valued at $49.16 billion, the firm also brokered the Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of The Washington Post. The play for Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the biggest and most high-profile bidding wars in recent years for any company, not just in media. Zaslav will continue to be the public face of the unfolding drama. But you can’t underestimate the investment banker whose team is busy behind the scenes with an opinion or two about the potential buyer that will make the most sense.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained Tuesday afternoon, extending Monday's rally to start a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked 0.1% higher. Kohl's (KSS) saw its shares surge 35% after the department store chain reported a surprise third-quarter profit. The results came a day after the retailer said it would remove the "interim" tag from CEO Michael Bender's title to take over the top job permanently after its prior CEO lasted just months before being ousted over allegations of improper dealings with a vendor. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) was another retailer that soared Tuesday, with shares up 30% after the company topped third-quarter earnings estimates. Sales growth has slowed among its namesake brand, but picked up for Hollister, which executives said is expected to carry the company's sales for the holiday season. Videoconference software maker Zoom Communications (ZM) also posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares 12% higher. The company said it is seeing meaningful adoption of its AI offerings. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank close to 4%, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 Tuesday following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using chips from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares of Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chipmakers also slid. Coinbase (COIN) stock was one of several connected to the cryptocurrency sector, along with Robinhood (HOOD), Mara Holdings (MARA), and Strategy (MSTR), that extended their recent declines as the price of Bitcoin lost ground, trading around $87,200. The price of gold rose, and crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 4.00%. The U.S. dollar lost ground against the pound, yen, and euro.

Title: Amazon's $50 billion plan - AWS to boost AI, supercomputing for US government agencies — What we know

Time Published: 2025-11-25T17:02:35Z

US-based technology giant Amazon announced its plans to invest up to $50 billion into the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities for the US government agencies through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to an official announcement. Amazon's investment in the expansion is aimed at improving the discovery and decision-making ability of the government agencies as they integrate their simulation and modeling data with AI, autonomous experimental steering and real-time feedback loops. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” said AWS CEO Matt Garman. “This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Amazon Web Services' (AWS) up to $50 billion investment is set to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. The company will build data centres with advanced computing and networking technology power as part of its expansion efforts. According to the official announcement, the federal government agencies will gain expanded access to AWS's comprehensive AI services, including Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, and Anthropic Claude, among other things. “These new capabilities will be available to existing and future U.S. government customers across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and GovCloud (US) Regions, strengthening America's AI leadership and giving federal agencies the secure, scalable infrastructure they need for the next era of innovation,” the company said in its announcement. The investment will also contribute to critical US government and industrial base missions ranging from national security to scientific research and innovation, which includes autonomous systems development, cybersecurity, energy innovation, and healthcare research. According to a recent report from CNBC, Amazon's move comes after Meta and Anthropic's decision to expand AI data centres in the United States, and Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank's plan to invest $500 billion in the country's AI infrastructure. Amazon share price jumped more than 1% to $228.64 during the intraday trading session on Tuesday as of 11:53 a.m. (IST), compared to $226.28 at the previous US stock market session, according to the MarketWatch data. Shares of the tech and e-commerce giant have given more than 43% returns in the last five years, and over 14% returns in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Amazon shares are trading 4.39% higher in 2025. The shares of Amazon hit their 52-week high level at $258.60, while the 52-week low level stood at $161.38, according to the MarketWatch data. The company's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.42 trillion as of the stock market session on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.

Title: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Bet on This Big Tech Stock. Should You?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-bet-on-this-big-tech-stock-should-you-alphabet-goog-googl-11856004
Time Published: 2025-11-25T16:24:06Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has placed a big bet on one of the tech’s hottest stocks. Berkshire (BRK.A)(BRK.B) purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet’s Class A stock (GOOGL) in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing made public earlier this month. A stake of that size in the Google parent would be worth nearly $5.7 billion as of Monday's close. Alphabet is an unusual purchase for Berkshire, which tends to buy unloved stocks with the intention of holding them long term. Alphabet, meanwhile, is far from unloved. The stock soared more than 6% Monday after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised its Gemini 3 AI model, saying he was “never going back” to using rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Later Monday, news reports—first published by The Information—indicated that it might sell AI chips to Meta Platforms (META), further strengthening investors' sense of the company's position. Alphabet shares added nearly 2% on Tuesday. Berkshire Hathaway is known for investing in companies with slow-and-steady businesses and, in the firm's opinion, undervalued stocks, making its Alphabet purchase a relatively unusual one. Not only is Alphabet a member of the Magnificent Seven—the high-flying set of tech stocks whose valuations have spooked investors of late—it’s also the best-performing member of the group by a long shot this year. Shares are up about 70%, more than double Nvidia's (NVDA) year-to-date return as of Tuesday's close. Alphabet isn’t the only Mag 7 stock in Berkshire’s portfolio. Apple (AAPL) is the conglomerate’s largest stock holding, worth about $65.7 billion. But it first bought Apple stock in 2016 and has been trimming that position for the past two years. Berkshire sold about 15% of its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter. Analysts are generally bullish on Alphabet stock. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target by 13% after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results late last month. The analysts called the report “strong across the board,” and noted Alphabet was showing “signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat,” contrary to Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts at Wedbush also raised their price target, and argued the quarter "validates Alphabet's position as a leading AI beneficiary.” Alphabet also raised its full-year capital expenditures guidance last month. It expects to invest more than $90 billion in capital equipment this year, with much of that going toward building data centers and filling them with chips to train and run AI models. Investors have recently grown wary of tech's AI spending, with some wondering when they'll see a return on their investments, if at all. Regardless, 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate shares a “buy,” and the remainder recommend holding the stock. Their average price target of $324 is right about where the stock closed on Tuesday. UPDATE: This article has been updated to include the latest stock price information.

Title: Larry Page becomes second richest person in the world after Alphabet share rally — What's his net worth?

Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person in the world, just after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. thanks to a bumper and ongoing rally in Alphabet stocks. Larry Page on Monday dethroned Oracle's Larry Ellison to snatch the position, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Shares of Alphabet climbed 6.31% on Monday at close after a report said Facebook-parent Meta Platforms was in discussions to use Google's AI chips in its data centers from 2027 and rent chips from Google Cloud by next year. Alphabet stock price today continued its rally to touch an all-time high at premarket trading on Tuesday, rising over 3%. As per Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, the net worth of Larry Page stood at $267.5 billion on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison of Oracle slipped to the No.3 position with a net worth of $250.5 billion. Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world, with his net worth hitting a massive $473.2 billion. On Monday alone, Larry Page's net worth climbed by $8.7 billion as per Forbes, thanks to the rally in Alphabet shares. The rally in Page's personal wealth over the past five years is impressive too, going from $50.9 billion in 2020 to $144 billion at the beginning of 2025. By the years end, he touched the quarter-trillion dollar mark. Larry Page is the co-founder of Google, one of the world's most recognised and valuable companies. Page founded the company with Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998, and used to be the CEO of Alphabet — the parent company of Google. Larry Page vacated the CEO office in 2019 but continued to remain a stakeholder at the company, which explains the meteoric surge in his wealth. At Google, he was the CEO till 2001. Shares of Google parent Alphabet have rallied almost 70% this year, outperforming other megacaps and bringing it close to the prized $4 trillion market capitalisation. Alphabet climbed 3.7% in premarket trading, bringing the search giant closer to a $4 trillion valuation. The rally came after the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions of dollars on the search giant’s artificial intelligence chips. Meta is in discussions to use the chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, according to the Information, which cited an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Shares of Nvidia Corp. plunged nearly 7% during early trade on Tuesday following reports that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is considering using chips designed by Google. The slide put the stock on track for its biggest monthly decline since the market rout of 2022. The share price has fallen about 15% month to date. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. gained as much as 2.6% higher, after a more than 6% rally on Monday. The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. The company released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, this month. A Google-Meta deal would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia's chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms. Graphics processing units (GPUs), dominated by Nvidia, were initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, particularly for video games and visual effects. However, their ability to handle large data sets and computations made them ideal for training AI models. In contrast, TPUs are specialised microchips, known as application-specific integrated circuits, designed specifically for a particular purpose. Last month, Google signed a deal with Anthropic PBC to supply up to 1 million of its specialised AI chips in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. Meta's capex of at least $100 billion for 2026 suggests it will spend at least $40-$50 billion on inferencing-chip capacity next year, as per a Bloomberg report.

Title: BitMine Bags 70K ETH As PEPENODE Mining Meme Coin Nears $2.2M in Viral Presale

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Ethereum treasuries are back in the spotlight. BitMine Immersion Technology just snapped up another 69,822 $ETH in a single week, lifting its stash to 3.63M $ETH (roughly 3% of the entire circulating supply), and boosting combined crypto and cash holdings to $11.2B. The timing is spicy. $ETH has dropped close to 30% over the past month, dragging the value of BitMine’s treasury down from over $12B to near $10–11B before the latest rebound. Yet BitMine keeps buying, effectively doubling down on an ‘own the network’ thesis while its stock trades under pressure like other crypto-treasury plays. It’s the same tension playing out in Bitcoin land. Large $BTC treasuries have seen their market caps slump relative to the value of the coins they hold. And yet, while some $BTC has bled off, the drumbeat of acquisitions continues. This ongoing trend generates a weird split: corporate balance sheets hoarding blue-chip crypto, public equity multiples compressing, and retail investors left wondering whether to buy the coins, the stocks, or something else entirely. That’s where high-yield narratives like PEPENODE start to look interesting, particularly for meme coin hunting retail traders. Instead of owning a listed treasury at a discount, you effectively buy into a mine-to-earn meme ecosystem with direct token exposure, aggressive staking yields, and gamified virtual mining mechanics. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is built as a mine-to-earn meme coin on Ethereum, but it doesn’t ask anyone to plug in an ASIC. Instead, the project unveils a fully virtual mining simulator where holders use $PEPENODE tokens to buy miner nodes and upgrade digital facilities. Here, you’re building out customizable server rooms that generate simulated hashpower and rewards inside a web app dashboard. The idea is simple but clever; virtual mining rewards put in a meme coin wrapper and accessible from any basic Ethereum wallet. No rigs, no cooling fans, no angry landlord. PEPENODE also leans into the meme economy. The roadmap includes rewards not only in $PEPENODE itself but also in some of the best meme coins like $PEPE and other community favorites. These rewards will go to the top leaderboard players once the full game is live. On top of the gameplay, the presale already offers staking, not at a whopping 589% rewards for early participants, with emissions distributed over two years. It fits the project’s pitch: reward early backers aggressively while the mine-to-earn ecosystem spins up. For anyone watching BitMine push toward a validator-heavy future with its planned US-based staking network, PEPENODE feels like the retail, gamified interpretation of the same meta, just with memes, frogs, and a leaderboard instead of a Nasdaq ticker. Check PEPENODE’s official website for more. While treasuries like BitMine and the big Bitcoin holders wrestle with stock prices that occasionally drift below the value of their underlying crypto, $PEPENODE is still in pure token-issuance mode. That puts new buyers roughly in line with recent analyst models. Our $PEPENODE token forecast sees a potential high of $0.0077 for 2026 if the mine-to-earn game launches on schedule, exchange listings land, and crypto sentiment stays constructive. From today’s presale price, that implies a theoretical upside of roughly ~560% into 2026 under optimistic conditions. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE to join now. Instead of paying a premium or small discount for a listed treasury stock, whose upside is tied to multiples and macro flows, you’re taking on a high-risk, high-reward crypto with high-APR staking, decent upside potential, and optional exposure to multiple meme assets via the virtual mining rewards. Instead of just parking tokens and waiting for TGE, early buyers can stake immediately, then later deploy those same tokens into nodes and upgrades once Phase 3 of the roadmap kicks in. The result is a presale that behaves less like a static raise and more like a soft launch of the game economy. Explore the PEPENODE presale while early. This is not financial advice. Crypto and presale investments are highly volatile; never risk capital you cannot afford to lose.

Title: Korean Retail Frenzy Triggers Harsh New Rules on US Leveraged ETFs
URL: https://beincrypto.com/south-korea-etf-training-rule/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T12:32:12Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth South Korea is tightening oversight of its most aggressive retail traders, introducing mandatory training for anyone who wants to trade foreign leveraged ETFs. The move follows a record surge of Korean money into high-risk US products—and growing concern that this speculative wave is distorting global markets. South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will require retail investors to complete a one-hour online course and a three-hour mock-trading exam before gaining access to foreign leveraged or inverse ETFs. The policy takes effect on December 15, 2025, and aligns foreign-market rules with domestic standards. The decision follows an extraordinary influx into US leveraged ETFs. Korean retail traders invested $7 billion in these products in October alone and $30 billion year-to-date, according to data from depository and ETFGI. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows October’s inflow was the highest monthly foreign ETF purchase on record. Officials say the training is needed because many investors fundamentally misunderstand the mechanics of daily leveraged products. The FSS has warned that traders often treat 2× or inverse ETFs as simple linear exposures, without accounting for compounding effects and volatility decay. According to the regulator, these factors can cause long-term returns to diverge sharply from those of the underlying asset. “The new policy will help individual investors acknowledge some of the most basic aspects of investing,” Bloomberg reported, citing Bora Kim, head of APAC strategy at Leverage Shares. Local Korean media further highlighted the extreme intensity of this trend, noting that individual investors, known domestically as “Seohak Ants,” have purchased 43 trillion won (about $29.3 billion) worth of US stocks this year, a record high. October alone saw 10 trillion won ($6.8 billion) in net purchases, with another 8.3 trillion won ($5.6 billion) in November, making 2025 the largest year of outbound retail stock buying since data began. The frenzy has also spilled into Korea’s dollar funding markets. Securities firms’ dollar repo balances have surged 15-fold since 2019 to 28.6 trillion won ($19.5 billion), driven by retail investors’ need to fund overseas stock purchases. This nonstop demand for dollars has pushed the won-dollar exchange rate into the mid-to-high 1,400 range, with risks of future currency losses if the won reverses. This regulatory shift comes amid a dramatic rise in Korean trading of US single-stock ETFs. Analysts, referencing market data, note that IONQ now trades more daily volume in Korea than Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, a remarkable contrast given the massive market-cap difference. BREAKING (Bloomberg): People Don’t Understand What’s Happening With RETAIL Investors in South Korea $IONQ $RGTI $QBTS South Korean retail is so obsessed with US leveraged ETFs that regulators are now forcing mandatory DMV-style training just to buy them.Starting Dec 15,… pic.twitter.com/6liTz9nHIg Korean retail is heavily concentrated in leveraged single-stock ETFs tied to niche companies, not just broad tech funds. Local media indicates that Two 2× IONQ ETFs (GraniteShares’ IONL and Defiance’s IONX) have seen outsized inflows from Korean investors seeking amplified exposure to quantum-computing stocks. Local media reports also show that retail investors are heavily concentrated in AI, semiconductor, and big-tech bets. SOXL, the 3× leveraged semiconductor ETF, was the most purchased security by Korean retail investors this year, with net buying exceeding 1.12 trillion won ($765 million). NVIDIA, Meta, and Alphabet followed, further confirming Korea’s intensifying concentration in US tech momentum trades. Accordingly, the top 10 stocks purchased in November include SOXL, Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, METU, IONQ, Palantir, TQQQ, BitMine, and QQQ. TrackInsight data shows that leveraged single-stock ETFs experienced weekly swings of 40% or more in October, further attracting speculative traders. This behavior marks a departure from earlier Korean trends, which favored mega-cap tech names such as Apple and Tesla. As of August 2025, 28.7% of all Korean retail overseas ETF holdings were in leveraged or inverse funds, a concentration significantly higher than the global norm. The prevailing sentiment is that Korean investors are increasingly viewing foreign ETFs as a “quick and easy way to create wealth.” However, leveraged ETFs automatically rebalance daily, which means they can magnify both rallies and losses. In stressed markets, this can lead to cascading liquidations and performance that deviates sharply from expectations. This means that the current environment may end in tears if volatility spikes. The risk is magnified by some traders using margin, heightening the potential for forced unwinds. While the new training aims to improve investor understanding, it is also worth probing whether a few hours of coursework can meaningfully reduce risk-taking in a market culture that embraces high leverage.

Wall Street’s smart money is starting to take out some short positions on the AI trade, albeit mostly around the industry’s fringes. Brian Boyle brian@thedailyupside.com It’s certainly not a Big Short. More like bigger than expected. According to Goldman Sachs’ latest report on hedge fund positioning, seen by the Financial Times on Monday, Wall Street’s smart money is starting to take out some short positions on the AI trade, albeit mostly around the industry’s fringes. Still, the skepticism comes amid growing fears of a broader AI bubble, which yesterday’s rally hardly ended. To be clear, hedge funds aren’t big-game hunting. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia remain the five most common long bets among funds analyzed by Goldman (Tesla, on the other hand, holds its position as one of the most popular short bets on Wall Street, with nearly $33 billion in short positions against it). Instead, the smart money appears to be on the hunt for companies swept up in the hype machine that may be flying too close to the sun. Cases in point: Palantir ($9.9 billion in short positions), Oracle ($5.4 billion), Intel ($4.6 billion), and Qualcomm ($4.4 billion). Goldman analysts also flagged which companies received the highest short interest as a percentage of market cap, a figure that might be a little more reflective of where Wall Street sees froth: Cut Off: The uptick in shorts doesn’t necessarily spell doom. The S&P 500 clawed more than 1.5% higher on Monday, after falling 2% last week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had its best day since May. The rally was sparked in part by comments from New York Fed President John Williams, who said on Friday that he sees labor weakness as a bigger threat than inflation. CME’s FedWatch tool now shows odds of a December rate cut at 81%, compared with just 42% a week ago. Gemini was trained on Google’s in-house chips, which look like a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Nvidia’s cutting-edge products. Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things. Getting us on an exercise bike doesn’t appear to be one of them. Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? Nvidia faced “the tough task of meeting high earnings expectations and high skepticism around AI capex,” per analysts at Bank of America. Executives are touting Gemini 3, which comes eight months after the chatbot’s 2.5 model, as a “massive jump” for AI. Bezos, the third-richest person in the world, will serve as co-chief executive and co-founder alongside physicist and chemist Vik Bajaj. The cult hero/curiosity has launched a social media broadside against the AI trade that has fueled this year’s market rally. Sam Altman has begun floating the idea that the company could hit $100 billion in revenue by 2027, ahead of previous projections. AI-assisted code editing startup Cursor became one of the most valuable firms in the booming sector overnight with a $29 billion valuation. Through the last 100 days, the Russell 2000 has bested the rival S&P SmallCap 600 by 9%, good for the widest gap since 2010. CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said on an earnings call that SoftBank’s divestment had “nothing to do with Nvidia itself.” At the end of the year, the legendary investor will hand the top job at the holdings giant he’s led for six decades to Greg Abel. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: TJX Wins Without An RMN; Unlearning To Crawl

The X Factor Big-box department and clothing stores are getting hammered. So why is TJX, the parent company of discount chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, crushing it right now? That’s a question recently mulled by Bloomberg writer Amanda Mull. For one, TJX has a few fortuitous tailwinds. Manufacturers over-acquired raw goods earlier this year to stock up for tariff-related price increases. That’s ideal for TJX, which buys products cheaply when other companies overproduce. But, also, TJX is not a retail media player whatsoever and cares way more about in-store sales than it does about ecommerce. In-person is simply a more exciting shopping experience, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. And that, he said, is something the competition lacks, excitement. Consumers are therefore “very open to trying us,” Herrman said. Other retailers have reshaped their store footprint around ecommerce warehousing and buy-online, pick-up-in-store fulfillment. Stores, in turn, become less appealing, sometimes as a direct result of retail media. Who remembers the Walgreens-Cooler-Screens fiasco? Don’t Crawl On Me Two roads diverged in a yellow wood: One leads to a partnership with OpenAI, the other to blocking OpenAI’s bots. In contrast to Walmart’s headfirst dive into agentic shopping, Amazon recently updated its robots.txt file to block more OpenAI bots from crawling its site, Modern Retail reports. ChatGPT has been providing more referral traffic for some retailers, like Walmart and Target, but Amazon prefers shoppers to purchase from it directly, rather than via ChatGPT. A primary incentive? Ads, of course. Amazon’s advertising business generates roughly $56 billion a year, according to Modern Retail, and depends on shoppers browsing its site. (People can bypass ads when they’re shopping via ChatGPT.) And so, for now, Amazon has been leaning into its own agentic shopping tools instead. Still, Amazon hasn’t fully ruled out future partnerships with third-party agents. During the company’s most recent earnings call in late October, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to “find ways to partner” with these companies in the future. Bipartisan Haterade You know you’ve messed up as a company when politicians are reaching across the aisle to try and figure out what your problem is. Sens. Josh Hawley (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D) have asked the FTC and SEC to investigate Meta’s reportedly fraud-filled ad ecosystem, according to The Guardian. In a joint letter, the senators cited recent reporting by Reuters that Meta is involved in one-third of all scams in the US and made $16 billion (or 10% of its overall revenue) from fraudulent and scam ads in 2024. This isn’t the first time Hawley and Blumenthal have teamed up against Meta. In April, they announced an investigation into Meta’s alleged collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party to build censorship tools. And, last month, they introduced a bill to Congress that would require AI chatbot companies to enforce stricter age verification measures. Basically, any time Meta makes headlines for something egregious, expect these guys to respond with world-class hater energy. Speaking of which, a newly released legal brief suggests that, in 2019, Meta halted internal research when findings suggested that people who stop using Facebook report feeling less depressed. It should be fun to see what the senators make of that. But Wait! There’s More! Foreign content creators are making bank off America’s polarized political climate.
