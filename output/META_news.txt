I will never go a day without Prime Biome again." 2. Daniel R., 45 – Austin, TX "As someone in my 40s, I noticed my skin aging faster and constantly bloating after meals. I read about Prime Biome and decided to give it a shot. Within weeks, I felt lighter, more energized, and—shockingly—my skin actually looked better. My wife even commented that my face looked ‘refreshed.’" 3. Jessica T., 27 – Miami, FL "I was tired of using expensive skincare products that never worked. I saw a friend raving about Prime Biome on Instagram and took the plunge. BEST DECISION EVER. My skin is no longer irritated, and my gut feels incredible.

Noah W., 37 – Seattle, WA "I originally bought Prime Biome for gut health, but the bonus was my skin looking the best it has in YEARS. My digestion is perfect, no more bloating, and my wife says my skin has a new glow. It’s now a non-negotiable part of my routine." These aren’t just random success stories—they’re proof that Prime Biome is changing lives. If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use. >>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption. ✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation. ✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps: ✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover. ✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness. ✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save! Get 75% Off + $300 Discount from the Official Site. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome: ✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux. ✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups. ✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight: A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue. ✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump. ✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work?

Final Verdict – Is Prime Biome Worth the Price? Considering its high-quality probiotic strains, potent plant extracts, and scientifically-backed formulation, Prime Biome delivers real value at a price that reflects its superior ingredients and effectiveness.

Rather than wasting money on ineffective solutions, consumers can secure real, long-term benefits by choosing a formula that actually works.

Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time. The absence of stimulants, fillers, and synthetic ingredients makes Prime Biome a truly clean and effective formula for people struggling with bloating, digestive issues, and skin concerns.

The Life-Changing Benefits of Prime Biome It’s not just a probiotic. It’s not just a skin supplement. Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See how Prime Biome can transform your digestion – Learn more. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels. Prime Biome’s unique formula corrects this imbalance by: Most people assume that slowed metabolism is a normal part of aging, but the truth is your gut plays a far bigger role than you realize. Prime Biome ensures your hormones stay balanced, metabolism stays high, and fat-burning remains effortless. >> Unlock the secret to effortless weight management – Learn more. 4. Strengthens Immunity and Reduces Chronic Inflammation A weak immune system isn’t just about getting sick more often.

Prime Biome’s potent probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants work to eliminate inflammation at its source, strengthening immunity on a cellular level. No single ingredient supplement can deliver this level of immune support. Prime Biome’s full-spectrum formula ensures your body stays resilient, energized, and free from chronic inflammation. >> Stop chronic inflammation before it starts – Learn more. Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 15,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid fakes! Order Prime Biome directly from the official website. 2. Are Competitors Trying to Sabotage Prime Biome? As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula. Unlike questionable supplements, Prime Biome offers full consumer protection, including: >> Don’t fall for fake reviews—try Prime Biome risk-free today. Is Prime Biome Safe? Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome truly stand out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See why Prime Biome is trusted by thousands for gut and skin health – Learn more. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics?

How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria. They enhance gut barrier function, preventing toxins and harmful bacteria from entering the bloodstream, which is a major contributor to inflammation, acne, and digestive discomfort. By formulating Prime Biome with highly bioavailable, scientifically backed ingredients, the supplement delivers far superior results than standard probiotic capsules. Rather than simply replenishing bacteria, it creates an optimal gut environment where beneficial bacteria can thrive, repair gut lining, and restore digestive health—leading to better metabolism, clearer skin, and overall vitality. Final Verdict – Is Prime Biome the Missing Piece to Your Health? After analyzing the science, real customer experiences, and the unique formulation of Prime Biome, it’s clear that this isn’t just another probiotic supplement—it’s a complete gut and skin health solution designed to target the root cause of digestive imbalance, inflammation, and premature aging. Unlike traditional probiotics that focus solely on gut bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by integrating powerful botanicals, prebiotics, and clinically studied probiotics to restore the gut microbiome, support cellular renewal, and enhance skin clarity. With thousands of satisfied users, scientific backing, and a commitment to high-quality, non-GMO, GMP-certified ingredients, it’s no surprise that Prime Biome is quickly becoming the go-to choice for those looking to improve their digestion, energy levels, and overall well-being. If you’ve been struggling with bloating, sluggish digestion, persistent skin issues, or even stubborn weight gain, it’s likely that your gut microbiome is out of balance. Prime Biome offers a simple, scientifically backed way to correct these issues at their source, leading to long-term health improvements that extend beyond just digestion. With its doctor-formulated blend, positive customer feedback, and a risk-free 60-day money-back guarantee, there’s no reason to settle for less when it comes to your gut and skin health.

Good morning. New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on how far the White House has gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government. It's the largest insight yet into the mass firings. Oh, and if you're missing your usual anchor Dan DeFrancesco, he's got a funny story for you from parental leave. In today's big story, tech companies are sending a message to employees: The days of perks and pampering are over. What's on deck First, the tables have turned. Do more with less. That's the new mantra in Silicon Valley. Gone are the days of the in-office massage, the free laundry services, and the fancy food. Layoffs and budget cuts have become pervasive in response to a trifecta of issues: economics, post-pandemic realities, and political pressure. But CEOs aren't just ending the office pampering — they want everyone to know it. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, the message is clear: Tech is going hardcore. Here are just several examples of how tech companies have changed their tune: Big Tech leaders haven't been shy about adopting hard-driving strategies. But what do their employees think? BI reporters interviewed staff at tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta — as well as various startups — about the changes. "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a current Google manager told BI. A recruiting firm cofounder said he's heard multiple leaders tell their employees the same thing: "If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down." Tech employees had it sweet. Now, they have to sweat. 1. Tesla's stock slide just sped up. Shares are on pace to fall for a 9th straight week, and the slide accelerated on Tuesday thanks to a hailstorm of issues involving its CEO, competition, and expectations on Wall Street. However, Tesla's employees — many of whom receive large stock grants as part of their compensation packages — aren't worried. 2. Stagflation is the market's big bogeyman. Investors dumped a record amount of US stock last week. Growing stagflation fears were key, a Bank of America survey found, with 71% of fund managers saying they expected it to hit the global economy in the next 12 months. 3. Predicting where stocks could go next. It's a bad idea to use news headlines when trying to guess where the markets will go. Technical analyst Helene Meisler told BI the five charts she's using instead to gauge market sentiment, and what she sees in its future. 1. A big acquisition with bigger implications. Google's parent company Alphabet has acquired the cybersecurity firm Wiz for a whopping $32 billion. The deal rewards early Wiz investors, but other startups could stand to benefit if it catalyzes an M&A cycle. It'll also test the regulatory environment under Trump. 2. Elon Musk has gone MIA as CEO. He's not the only one. Musk's reign at DOGE has Tesla investors wanting their CEO back — but he's not the first chief executive to go AWOL. Company morale and productivity are paying the price. 3. Everything Jensen Huang revealed at the Nvidia conference. The CEO shared the company's road map for the next few years, including updates on the next generation of chips. He also introduced Blue, a "Star Wars"-like robot, to show off a partnership with Google and Disney. 1. One year after the real-estate revolution. A landmark settlement upended traditional industry practice by changing the way real estate agents are paid. Now, some Americans are saving big on homebuying. 2. The vibecession is back. The US isn't in a recession, but Americans feel like they're in one. That's thanks to recent market volatility, Trump's shifting tariff policies, and more. Even if the economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession still has serious consequences. 3. Inside JPMorgan's RTO plans for its largest office. Employees at JPMorgan's Polaris campus are heading back to the office next month. The bank is promising amenities like upgraded dining and shuttle services, according to a memo exclusively seen by BI, but not everyone is thrilled. Jensen Huang delivers keynote speech at Nvidia GTC AI conference. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: Sorting out the confusion on quantum computing utility

Understanding quantum computing’s pace of progress is not an easy task. Recent months have complicated it with contradictory messages. CEOs like Jensen Huang (Nvidia) and Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) estimated that useful quantum computers were decades away, while others like Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Sundar Pichai (Google) cast it as being just years from now. Some companies even stated that quantum computers would soon run LLMs more efficiently, with a lower energy footprint than classical HPCs running Nvidia GPUs. Your newsfeed is now full of imperatives: “the advent of useful quantum computers is not a matter of if, but when“, “this is the year to get ready” (whatever the year), “if you don’t jump in now, you’re late” (striking fear), such and such technology announcement “is a breakthrough” (Google Willow in December 2024, Microsoft Majorana-1 in February 2025), “we are getting closer to scalable quantum computers” (hopefully, not farther), “quantum computing progress is accelerating” (how do measure progress speed?), Google Willow or China’s Zuchongzhi quantum computers are already computing zillion “times faster than the largest classical supercomputer“, and so on! The stock market’s ups and downs shake the market cap of Rigetti, D-Wave and IonQ. Here, trust is not based on science but on buzz and beliefs, often only grounded on company’s investor decks and quarterly results. This is the characteristic of a “technology hype”, with its overpromises. These are fueled by research and industry vendor funding mechanisms, technology sovereignty issues, analysts and service companies’ opportunism and media buzz, which I described in an arXiv paper in 2022. End-user organizations and policymakers are also confused. You need a cold head to analyze this frenzy. You’re better off being embedded in the quantum ecosystem to know its stakes, but also, not being too much conflicted from the financial standpoint. Evaluating the quantum computing state of the art requires a broad scientific and technological background. If you are a quantum physicist, you may be too specialized, not knowing much about quantum algorithms. On the other hand, if you are a quantum software developer with not much knowledge of the hardware, you may not grasp the physics challenges to build a large scale quantum computer. And you are better off with having some knowledge of the state of the art in classical computing (GPUs, tensor networks, machine learning, etc.) against which quantum solutions are compared. So, here I am, with a couple of others, trying to bridge these gaps and to provide some understanding of the situation. To ease its reading, this paper is structured as a FAQ, addressing the following questions: It’s a bit like if you had 16 short papers for the price of one, given it’s free. If you cry very loudly, I can turn this into a series of 16 TikTok videos. Or maybe not… Still, you have a one liner blue response to all these questions. And then, elaborations! How to define utility-grade quantum computing? Who you are: a quantum physicist doing a Fermi-Hubbard simulation of some ferromagnetic material (example), a pharmaceutical company willing to simulate large molecular dynamics to design some new drug, a chemical company designing a new battery, a financial institution in search of better portfolio optimization techniques or a transportation company willing to optimize its operations? What benefit are you looking for: a quantum speedup, providing improved results like better chemical accuracy for some chemical simulation, a better solution with heuristics used to find approximate solutions of optimization problems, do something that is entirely impossible with classical computers, do stuff cheaper, with cheaper hardware or less energy? The definition of a “quantum computing advantage” is nowadays becoming multifactorial. Compared to what? The notion of usefulness is also not absolute but relative to classical computing. It can be against your own IT legacy or with best-in-class up-to-date classical solutions. Nvidia GPUs, deep learning techniques and classical tensor networks (MPS, DMRG) are continuously moving the goalpost for quantum computing to yield some quantum advantage. One interesting example is AlphaFold 3 from Google DeepMind, which does stuff initially thought only possible with future quantum computers in the 3D modeling predictions of complex organic molecules. At what cost? The value of anything new comes from computing its return on investment in comparison with competing solutions. With current quantum computers, this is a rarely debated aspect. Nobody really elaborates on the current and future prices of quantum computers. In the FTQC regime, it will become an important one, which will depend on the affordability of these systems. Hint: utility grade quantum computers supporting the thousand logical qubits and teraquops needed to run industry-grade applications may cost between $10M (which is acceptable) to several $1Bs (which is not), depending on the technology. This is like in quantum physics, it’s all about the measurement context! Variation of a slide from my QEI Workshop presentation showing how practical benefits are connected to the solution’s economics and business benefits (video, slides). One effect described in the above chart is the virtuous cycle that can come from platform and network effects coupled with the versatility of quantum computing systems. These could enlarge the quantum computing market and contribute to developing economies of scale, in turn driving prices down and extending its reach. This is the ultimate definition of “utility grade”. What quantum utility has been achieved so far? Consider IBM’s communication on “quantum utility” which started in June 2023 with the publication of a Nature paper and subsequent scientific papers related to the use of their most recent quantum computer (Eagle with 127 qubits, and, later, Heron with 133 or 156 qubits), or more recently, D-Wave with its 4,400 qubit Advantage 2 quantum annealer. These “utility cases” were about simulating some kicked Ising model for IBM, and the quench dynamics of two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses for D-Wave. This is about simulating the magnetism of materials at around 0K, a temperature found only in physics labs, at a scale supposedly unreachable by classical computers! These are interesting physics problems but far from any industry relevant problem. On top of that, both in both the IBM and D-Wave cases, subsequent papers argued that the quantum solution could be implemented classically, using tensor network methods, noticeably from the Flatiron Institute in New York (vs IBM and vs D-Wave). This spurs endless debates between the vendors and these classical computing specialists (example from D-Wave’s CEO). Right now, we have in-store quantum computers operating in gate-based mode like IBM’s, or using some analog processes like D-Wave quantum annealers or Pasqal/QuEra cold-atom-based quantum analog simulators. Quantum computing utility faces different challenges in all these cases due to algorithms resource requirements, theorical vs practical speedups, and (un)availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers of sufficient size. I ordered these who/what scenarios by order of potential appearance, spanning from now to 20 years. A chart positioning various use cases for quantum computing, from fundamental research to applied research and business operations. Current NISQ solutions seem to fare well in the first category. Future FTQC algorithms will probably bring some exponential speedups and improved results in the second category. The third one based on optimization and machine learning algorithms is more challenging at this point. Source: slides. You now understand why CEOs and commenters don’t look at the same target. Their wording and definitions are imprecise. BSI is focusing on cryptanalysis, so, as a threshold, breaking an RSA-2048 key using Shor integer factoring, while Jensen Huang talked about the fuzzy notion of useful quantum computers, probably thinking about doing stuff that is out of reach of existing and future classical systems. And when D-Wave touts quantum supremacy, it’s about implementing some physical simulation that happens to be useless for all companies. As a result, the irrelevance and standard deviation of all these CEO predictions are pretty high. But claiming that “the utility era is here” is clearly an overpromise, particularly, with mentioning the capability to solve some “real-world chemistry problem” with… two logical qubits! What is the difference between a use case and… a use case? Crafted in 1982, the notion of vaporware described a software or hardware product that was announced but released much later or even never released. One famous vaporware was the first version of Microsoft Windows that was announced in 1983 but released only in 1985. In the quantum world, this would be like releasing a product at the speed of light. Is quantum computing a modern version of vaporware? No! We have interesting algorithms and software that could provide some potential benefit. They “just” lack the quantum hardware to be executed and deployed. This explains why we have so many application “use cases” which are not real “use cases”. Most quantum computing use cases are small-scale prototype algorithms that are tested either in emulation mode or with NISQ quantum computers, often in a regime using so few qubits that they could be emulated on a simple laptop. In that situation, a laptop or simple server would be a more efficient solution with regards to computing time and solution cost. These use cases are frequently presented as “industry use cases”, which is ambiguous. It may mean “for the industry”, but not “in production”. Unfortunately, most of these use cases do not describe well the conditions to obtain some quantum advantage (problem size, number and quality of qubits, etc.). It even happens with scientific use cases like this recent one that is using a mere 16-qubit QPU. Use cases in analysts parlance, source: McKinsey. In 2023! These “use cases” can start to become interesting when they reach a regime where a classical quantum code emulation is impossible, even using tensor networks compression, when no equivalent classical solution can deliver a similar result in a reasonable time and when it is using real-life data sets. So far, this seems to be not yet possible for industry applications. When it happens, it sits in the “applied research” zone and not in the “industry utility” zone. It seems we’ll have to wait for FTQC QPUs to enable real-life industry use cases. For more insights on this, I published a framework to analyze use cases back in October 2023. Why are the first quantum utility use cases about simulating condensed matter physics at 0K and not solving your business problem? Simulating spin-glass models is easier with D-Wave annealers because they are themselves implementing spin models (below). Gate-based computers like the ones from IBM are also adapted to the implementation of spin models due among other things to their qubit layout. This is inline with the famous Richard Feynman’s motivation to build a quantum computer in 1981, laid out in the 1982 paper: Simulating Physics with Computers (22 pages). But chemical simulations are about simulating so-called fermionic models, when both gate-based and analog quantum computers are implementing bosonic models. As a result, computational problems that are not natively formulated as spin problems or bosonic problems need some conversion, which incurs a significant classical and quantum computing overhead. It is the same with solving combinatorial optimization problems. They can be mapped on quantum annealers or quantum analog simulators, but with some significant “embedding” overhead. All this explains why other problems require larger quantum computers, with our current knowledge of quantum algorithms. Hopefully, quantum hardware and algorithms are making progress and folks are still hopeful to find some Holy Grail there. What are the challenges of building utility-grade quantum computers? As a cofounder of the Quantum Energy Initiative with an engineering background and perspective, I am looking at the challenges ahead to build utility-grade quantum computers, particularly in the FTQC regime. Understanding, evaluating and optimizing the energetics of these systems must be based on a holistic scientific and engineering perspective, up to looking at the economics of quantum computers. This complements a bottom-up approach that is focused on determining the fundamental bounds of qubits operations, belonging to the fields of quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics. In the second QEI Workshop held in Grenoble in January 2025, I had a chance to provide a view on current quantum computing roadmaps and their energetics aspects (video, slides). In this talk, I inventoried some challenges and connected them to dozens of scientific and engineering questions: I should add here various other scalability challenges like handling data preparation efficiently, particularly for solving linear equations and quantum machine learning tasks. Then, we are still in search of some potential qRAM, a memory type that is nearly mandatory to execute oracle-based algorithms. Then, each qubit type (or “modality”) has its own scalability challenges. They can be very different. For example, solid-state qubits like superconducting and silicon-spin qubits are fighting against decoherence, noise and crosstalk whereas photonic qubits are hampered by low photonic sources and detector efficiencies and losses along the paths in photonic integrated circuits and optical fibers. These are very different scientific and engineering challenges. What is the current TRL of quantum computers? A TRL, aka, technology readiness level, is a metric from 1 to 9 defined by NASA in the mid-1970s. It characterizes the level of maturity of a given technology or product. 1 stands for an idea in the head of a researcher and 9 for a widely deployed technology like your smartphone or laptop computer. In between are physical experiments, prototype products and the first products being deployed. The TRL of a product can also be characterized by the readiness of its related ecosystem (training, skills, applications, documented deployed case studies). Let’s consider the quantum TRL scale created by Kristel Michielsen in 2018, as shown below. According to this scale, quantum annealer’s TRL sits around 7 while gate-based systems are at around 5 given they are not yet commercially implementing quantum error correction. You can still buy a gate-based QPU with over a hundred physical qubit, like Cleveland Clinic who acquired a System One from IBM and installed it in Spring 2023, You can use them in the cloud through AWS, Microsoft, IBM or D-Wave online services. You can learn quantum programming and test your code. Even D-Wave has an (undocumented) SLA (service level agreement) should you use their online QPUs for production. There are already tens of thousands of quantum developers worldwide thanks to these systems being available online. You can test a 127-qubit IBM Eagle-generation QPU for free. But the TRL is also currently quite low when considering the usefulness of quantum computers with regards to their added value and cost. Let’s say you test an online quantum computer with 20 operational noisy qubits. The system probably costs several $Ms and its hourly usage is charged at about $2K. But $2K is the price of a laptop where you could run your quantum code in a free open source emulator. And it would even run faster than on the quantum computer. For a higher number of qubits on a current noisy quantum computer, the situation is blurred depending on your use case as explained when responding to the previous question. So, technically, quantum computers (QPU) TRL sits at around 5-8 depending on the case, but their actual value is still low compared to legacy classical systems. Are NISQ computers useful for the industry? NISQ computers are the current noisy qubit quantum computers. Those you can buy, rent or test today. The current wisdom is that, while they have some scientific value, their industry value is questionable. This is John Preskill’s view. I described NISQ challenges in a 2023 paper, and things have not significantly changed since then. The main NISQ recent advances come from some improvements in qubit numbers and fidelities, with both superconducting and ions qubits, and from the use of quantum error mitigation, a technique promoted among others by IBM. Some use cases are presented, like with the interesting work from Algorithmiq, a software startup based in Finland. A broad industry and academic team led by Sabrina Maniscalco, who is the CEO of Algorithmiq, published a paper willing to fight some myths on NISQ: Myths around quantum computation before full fault tolerance: What no-go theorems rule out and what they don’t by Zoltán Zimborás, Fernando G. S. L. Brandão, Elica Kyoseva, Ivano Tavernelli, Sabrina Maniscalco et al, arXiv, January 2025 (11 pages). It tried to show that the power and use cases of NISQ with quantum error mitigation could be expanded thanks to the upcoming improvements of qubit fidelities. However, the paper leaves the question open of whether NISQ systems will deliver some exponential or practical speedups. Another open question is lingering about the potential known and unknown limits of analog quantum computing. What is it to be pessimistic or optimistic? First, you need to understand where we are and to identify the scientific and engineering challenges ahead. Some are workable, others are really hard. It never necessarily means that “it’s impossible”. It is up to scientists and engineers to find solutions. You then need to appreciate how long it could take, understanding for example the lengths of the manufacturing-testing-experimenting cycles that dominate in this industry. These cycles are long! Usually, the more you know a topic, the less optimistic you may become because you understand the sheer weight of the challenges ahead. It can lead to sheer pessimism. Listening to educated pessimists should be used to challenge the optimists. But you can also be excited by these challenges and by human creativity. That’s my situation. I try to avoid flirting with optimism or pessimism, which are just two opposite moods. I stick to the scientific state of the art and remaining challenges. My own belief is that by doing so, you are neither pessimistic nor optimistic, you are just neutral with some optimism bias even though the pure optimists will perceive you as being a pessimist. So, pessimism or skepticism? Source. When you identify challenges in the quantum computing space, and there are many, most of them are currently being addressed in multiple ways by scientists and industry vendors. What can make you optimistic is that multiple technologies are being developed, like with the types of qubits or even with all the varieties of quantum algorithms around. How to grade the related scientific vs technology uncertainty? A common wisdom with many physicists, including the Nobel in physics laureates I met in Lindau in July 2024 is that the challenges ahead are mainly about engineering and technology developments. According to them, the theory is accepted and proven. But some scientists, like Alain Aspect, also think that creating large scale quantum computers may require significant time, a bit like the LIGO gravitational waves detection experiment which took about 25 years from design to completion (from 1989 to 2015). I do not entirely agree with that focus on engineering. While for sure, engineering and technology developments are inescapable routes to building fault-tolerant quantum computers, there are still some scientific uncertainties to unfold. A bit like the whole history of physics, experimenting new artificial settings will uncover new mysteries which may require building new theories, a bit like Zeeman’s effect discovered in 1896 could be explained only about 30 years later with electron spins. Here, we don’t know yet what we will discover when creating large-scale physical qubit systems. Will they showcase high-fidelity entanglement states at scale? How will we characterize it? Will we reach the famous Heisenberg cut, when macroscopic systems stop behaving quantumly with coherence and behave classically without it? Will we face the effects of the Lieb-Robinson bound that conditions the speed of correlation propagation in large scale entangled systems? It may affect large QPUs, particularly those which are implemented using quantum interconnect techniques. The confusion may come from the difference between theory and science in general. Quantum physics theory may be somewhat settled, but fundamental research and experimental research is still an open field. Another huge quantum computing scientific uncertainty lies with algorithms. We don’t have that many quantum algorithms and even fewer quantum algorithms with provable exponential speedups, or practical speedups with reasonable times. There is still a lot of fundamental research to do there. It is likewise with quantum error correction. How about new sources of correlated errors that we’ll discover with scalable systems and for which current error correction codes are not well adapted? In the technology realm, we don’t know yet if the improvement of chips manufacturing processes will yield better quality qubits. We need to test it. At last, how about various “unknown unknowns”? I’d say quantum computing is becoming a broad scientific experimental endeavor, mixing theoretical and experimental advances, one helping the other. We need these experiments to validate the theory and/or to extend it. We also need to accept failures and try various technology avenues. That’s why it doesn’t yet make much sense to launch a Manhattan like project on a specific qubit modality. It explains for example why DARPA is funding about 11 different such avenues as part of its Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) and Quantum Benchmark Initiative programs. What is the cost of trying these various avenues? Is it acceptable? It is currently mainly supported by a mix of public and private investments with a high proportion of the former. It will go on like this if the strategic stakes are perceived as being as high as they are today. A bird’s eye view on the realizations (green), challenges (orange/red), variations (grey) and paths to scalability (blue) for seven qubit types: superconducting, silicon, topological, cavities, cold atoms and trapped ions. They are all different! Source: Understanding Quantum Technologies 2024. Is the pace of progress of quantum computing accelerating? The perception of acceleration comes from industry vendor hyperbolic communication. Recent news pushed by large companies like Google and Microsoft are driving this impression. Microsoft oversold its topological qubit, that are supposedly around the corner. They are not! Too many scientific or industry communications are about “getting closer to scalable quantum computing” (example 1, example 2, example 3). I don’t believe there is some acceleration. There is progress for sure, but no acceleration. First and foremost, how do you measure acceleration and speed of progress? What is the comparable? What is the meter and unit? One way to proceed is to compare what scientific and technological advances have been achieved vs past plans. When I started working in the quantum computing space in 2018, I tracked the following announcements: Rigetti was planning to release a 128 qubit QPU in 2019, IonQ was mentioning that it had controlled 160 qubits on which it could handle operations on 79 qubits, and Intel was showcasing a silicon chip with the capacity to host 1,500 qubits in a chip thinner than a human hair. In 2019, Google had a 53 qubit chip (Sycamore) and IBM, a 65 qubit chip (Hummingbird r1). Where are we now, 6 to 7 years later? Rigetti’s best chip is Ankaa-3 with 84 qubits. IonQ is at 36 qubits with its Forte system while Intel has a vague 12-qubit chip named Tunnel Falls released in 2023, that is not integrated in a full QPU system. Google reached 105 qubits with its Willow chip announced between August and December 2024 and IBM has a 156-qubit chip. Meanwhile, these qubits fidelities have somewhat improved but not in a stellar way. IBM’s 433 Osprey and 1,121 Condor qubit chips which were released in late 2022 and 2023 were even discontinued in favor of smaller chips (Heron 156 qubits) due to their lack of tunable couplers. With these couplers, IBM’s Heron is faring well, at about 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities, not far from what is currently achieved with trapped-ions (99.84% at Quantinuum with its H2-1 system). Still, all this doesn’t look like being exponential. It proved more challenging to increase the number of qubits of decent quality at intermediate scales of about a hundred physical qubits. You can see the trend in the updated scatter plot below. The blue dots are about superconducting qubits and the green ones with trapped ions. Cold atoms in orange seem to scale well but have a hard time exceeding two-qubit gate fidelities of 99.5%. Ions achieve that, faring at >99.8% but are still struggling with scaling. Superconducting qubits are in-between, with 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities at between 105 and 156 physical qubits. In other qubit modalities, progress looked faster, like with cold atoms, first on large settings like Pasqal with the control of 828 atoms in 2024, and Caltech with 6,100 atoms, and then in gate-based mode (QuEra, starting in December 2023 with 48 basic logical qubits, Atom Computing with 24 logical qubits in November 2024). Photonic qubits are either locked at low qubit count in the non-scalable KLM paradigm (Quandela, Orca Computing, …) or are bound to implement FTQC scalable architecture in the more or less distant future (again with Quandela, with PsiQuantum, and Xanadu). Since 2018, we’ve also seen the emergence of new breeds of qubits implementing some autonomous error correction, like the cat-qubits from Alice&Bob and AWS, or the GKP qubits from Nord Quantique. These are encouraging new technology developments that may reduce the physical per logical qubits number overhead. There are several technical limitations to the # of qubits per monolithic quantum processors. It leads their designers to envision using various quantum interconnect solutions (microwaves, optical photons, transduction), which will bring a wealth of new challenges, from physics to quantum code compiling and optimization. We thus have to be very careful when extrapolating physical qubit numbers, particularly toward million qubit ranges. While there was significant progress in the field of quantum error correction, these advances were not well interpreted. For example, Google Willow’s logical qubit only corrects errors in a quantum memory, but not single or two qubit logical gate errors. It is thus far from being “fault-tolerant”. Likewise, the logical qubits created by QuEra and Quantinuum (with Microsoft) implement logical gates, but with the non-scalable trick of “post-selection”. It has the flavor of quantum error mitigation implemented in post-processing manner more than a fault-tolerant scheme adapted to running large quantum circuits. As I described in my Moore’s paper in 2023, scaling QPUs won’t probably follow any Moore’s law like with CMOS semiconductors because the scalability challenges are highly multidimensional. It’s not just a matter of shrinking transistors. I simplify things here since advances in CMOS were more complicated than that. Also, the test & learn cycles with various quantum computing technologies are relatively slow and don’t follow any Moore’s law. However, we may underappreciate some interesting technology developments happening in the background that will pay off later: on cryogenic control electronics, on high-density cabling, control signals multiplexing, high-power and low phase noise lasers, and with high-power cryogenics. The Coyote and Road Runner. A famous Warner cartoon known by boomers. Image source. Now, who’s who here? The Coyote may represent quantum computers while road runner is classical computing. And maybe, someday, it will be the other way around. What is special about quantum computing with regard to predictions? In the not-so-distant past, predictions abounded about how fast a technology revolution would be adopted. The cloud, mobile computing, Internet of things, and more recently the metaverse. Artificial intelligence made its comeback in two periods, one between 2012 and 2022 with machine learning and deep learning around data science concepts, and since 2022, with the advent of LLM-based chatbots. In these domains, the technology was more or less mature, but it had proven use cases that were beyond the state of the art. For example, mobile computing and cloud computing brought usability and easy access to multi-format communication on the go. In other domains like with IoT and metaverses, the generic user value was neither obvious nor universal. The uncertainties in these various domains were however not so much about the underlying science and technology, than on other factors: costs, ease of use, user value, physiological acceptability in the case of the metaverse, social impact and so on. With quantum computing, we are exposed to a flurry of market predictions including how much value it could generate, around $2T as soon as 2035 according to McKinsey before even the technology is ready. Even if it was ready in 2025, it would take more than 10 years to yield such value. You’d have to deploy it, to create algorithms, to run it, to try different options to create a digital twin of a new drug or chemical compound candidate. Then, you’d have to test it in the real world, either undertaking multi-year clinical tests or launching the buildout of new manufacturing plants. And so on. This takes time! McKinsey quantum monitor as of April 2024. Notice the $42B total government investment which is wrong due to bad estimated of China’s investments as well explained in The Quantum Panic – The U.S. wants to be prepared for whatever quantum technologies bring, but is it time to rightsize the threat from China? by Rachel Cheung, The Wire China, February 2025. How can we compare today’s situation and uncertainties with quantum computing to the ones we had 30 years ago or so in other domains? There were not many doubts back then about the progress ahead with raw computing power, memory, storage and networking capabilities growth. Moore’s law was kind of predictable, at least until the mid-2000s. Telecom infrastructures were key for developing the Internet and for smartphones and the cloud. There were some infrastructure built out delays for fiber installation around the world. However, this was not due to uncertainty in scientific or technology. It was more an economic issue. Also, many Internet developments benefited from the technology but were accelerated for societal reasons, like with the advent of the web 2.0 around 2004. There are some parallels to draw here with FTQC QPUs. At some point, they will become heavyweight infrastructure programs requiring significant funding, beyond classical research funding in the academic and startup world. In our analysis, we are often affected by a “survival bias”. We use the example of successes as proof of our reasoning, forgetting past failures. They don’t resonate in memories since they didn’t affect us much. In the mid-1980s, there was some buzz on GaAs electronics, that was supposed to supplant CMOS. It didn’t, mostly for engineering and economic reasons. Nanomaterials and graphene technologies had similar troubles, ranging from scientific and technology overpromises and societal backlash. Classical analog computing was promoted in the 1960s to 1970s but failed, being overcome by digital computing. It was not generic enough and didn’t scale well due to noise. Quantum computers are also analog to some extent, of course, with analog quantum systems ala Pasqal and D-Wave, but also with NISQ systems implementing arbitrary rotation gates. One key difference is that FTQC mixes analog and discrete operation, which is to enable quantum error correction, a feat that was not accessible to classical analog computers. Also, analog computing didn’t benefit from the same attention and public investments as we have right now with quantum computing. There was no equivalent of Shor’s algorithm to drive government interest. The EAI 8800 Analog computing system in 1986. Source. By the way, where are we with the promises of the Hyperloop, promoted by a certain Elon Musk in a 2013 white paper? Several ambitious infrastructure projects were supposed to be launched around the world. A couple startups were created. Twelve years later, it’s not really in the radar. The idea is plagued with a mix of engineering problems, safety problems, capacity and economic limitations and huge infrastructure costs. How about drones flying around to transport passengers from airports to cities? They can indeed fly. But with limited range, air trafic control challenges, economic challenges again, and so on. Now, let’s consider the Apollo program. It took only 8 years from JFK’s speech in May 1961 to Congress to having men landing on the Moon in July 1969. Yuri Gagarine had been sent to space a couple weeks earlier, in April. JFK confirmed the goal in another speech in September 1962, listing some technical challenges. Weeks from the start of the Cuban missiles crisis! Of course, the Moon quest project was fueled by huge investments but it was mostly about solving technology challenges. In 1961, engineers already knew how to launch a rocket and send a human into space. Newton’s laws were already vindicated. But there was the Cold War between the USA-USSR rivalry. Quantum computing seems much different and more challenging than all the above examples from the scientific and engineering perspective. There are superposed stacks of uncertainties from securing large scale entanglement to designing useful algorithm, and with relatively long test and learn cycles. And we have not yet started the real economical discussion about the price of these systems and their return on investment. From the scientific and engineering standpoint, quantum computing seems closer to nuclear fusion. Both are linked to the limits of physics and experimentation. The advantage of quantum computing is that it is way less capex intensive than nuclear fusion. At least at this point. Will quantum computers run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers? Some quantum computing companies like IonQ and Quantinuum are flirting with the idea that quantum computers may someday run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers. They could even be more energy efficient. What investors got from some IonQ presentation in 2024. Source. Unfortunately, quantum computers will probably not help mitigate the growth of energy consumption linked to consumer LLM based-generative AI. Data loading is quantum computers’ Achilles’ heel and will remain so for a long time given they will unlikely benefit from some hardware Moore’s law in relation to their clock speed. Given the size of both the training data (in petabytes and tera-tokens encoded in highly multidimensional vectors) and models (in tera-parameters), they won’t be loaded at a reasonable timescale on any quantum computer for training, even with some classical data ingestion and preparation. Variable computing and energetic costs are mostly in inferences which are run nearly real-time. Any quantum algorithms running in a quantum advantage regime will probably not be real-time. We can also use some simple logic here. An inference would require one quantum computer and there are hundreds of millions of users of these LLM chatbots. Unless some clever algorithm enables multiple inferences to run on single QPUs, this can’t scale well. There are no available resource estimates on how some FTQC quantum computers could handle any LLM task. The path to quantum transformers by David Wakeham, Xanadu, April 2024, provides sketchy classical and quantum computing requirements to train LLMs. It shows that even with very optimistic assumptions on the clock speed of quantum computers (in GHz), and with several tens of thousands of logical qubits, quantum computers would be faster than classical computers for the embedding part of LLM only after a couple decades, but this task could be run classically and only kernel operations handled quantumly (linear operations using block-encode matrices). Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures by Naixu Guo, Zhan Yu, Matthew Choi, Aman Agrawal, Kouhei Nakaji, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, and Patrick Rebentrost, arXiv, February-May 2024 (31 pages) states that “embedding large data into quantum computers is difficult in the absence of the availability of functioning quantum RAMs”. So maybe, we should invent the notion of qSLM for quantum small language models! However, the broader field of quantum artificial intelligence, not including LLMs for consumer chatbots, is a good exploration path, particularly when there is a need to use smaller data for training and to obtain better accuracy in inferences. Quantum machine learning can potentially be used for both training and inferences. There are still many technology interdependencies here: on data preparation and on the development of qRAM and on the connection between classical and quantum components of an AI solution. One thing is sure: classical AI already helps develop quantum technologies, in quantum error mitigation, quantum error correction at the error syndrome detection level, qubit calibration, and even circuit design (using custom Transformers). How about the if/when mantra? Analysts and others are frequently parroting the “if not when” mantra, saying that the question is not if scalable quantum computers will appear but when. As shown above, there are still many “ifs” which explain a lot of the uncertainty on the “when”. Otherwise, we would have an infinite certainty on the “when”. It is a bit like if “if” and “when” were complementary observables in Niels Bohr’s parlance. And due to Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, you can’t be precise on both observables. So if you dare want to be a bit more precise on the “when”, you need to be less accurate on the “if”. Should I wait, or should I go? That’s the typical question for end-user companies. Some analysts are playing with FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to drive customers on the quantum computing bandwagon: human skills and quantum computing resources will be scarce, there will be a significant first-mover advantage, and your competitiveness will highly depend on your adoption of quantum technologies. I don’t believe any of these assertions to be true or verifiable. If quantum computers work at scale and benefit customers, hardware vendors will manufacture them and sell them. In the history of technology, even for large systems like supercomputers, there’s never been a real scarcity problem. And if there was one, it would mean that scalable quantum computers are way too large and costly. Then, human skills can follow-on. We already have a good stream of young people being trained. Finally, your competitiveness may only marginally depend on quantum computing. Some early adopters of quantum computing in Europe across multiple verticals: energy utilities, chemicals, telecoms, financial services, air/defense, automotive and transportation. Source: OE. Still, I would advise customers to invest in quantum computing. Am I contradicting myself? No, I’m just basing my rationale on different arguments. One is that testing quantum computing is not expensive and is part of any techno-screening of any large company. You don’t need to acquire a $40M QPU. You can rent it for cheap in the cloud. You can even learn quantum coding with free open source emulators. Second, learning quantum computing is an excellent way to revisit your existing applications portfolio. It helps you identify pain points in scalability or output quality, revisiting the algorithms you are using. At some point, it will help you modernize your IT, and not necessarily with quantum computing. You may land in using GPUs and/or tensor network “quantum inspired” classical applications. Learning about quantum computing can help you upgrade your algorithms teams. It will push them to develop better mathematical skills, like in the financial services vertical. It will also help customers deal with the aggressive push from industry vendors and to decipher the continuous news stream. In just one week, you’ll have thousand of talks from quantum physicists at the APS March Meeting held in Anaheim, and the Nvidia Quantum Computing Day in San Francisco, hosting a dozen quantum computing vendors. Get ready for a flurry of announcements! Of course, another minimal task to launch is the audit and upgrade of the company cybersecurity infrastructure. Whether you like it or not, you’ll have to fold in deploying post-quantum cryptography. So, learn quantum computing at small scale, educate your own technical people, try small things, be ready to adopt the technology should quantum computing scale well on a reasonable time horizon. How to interpret the quantum stocks’ ups and downs? In Summer 2024, Rigetti and D-Wave risked being delisted from the Nasdaq due to their stock becoming for some time a “penny stock”, valued at less than a US dollar. But in October 2024, they escaped this dangerous zone. Then, Google’s Willow PR blitz in December 2024 drove the stock to sky highs. It happened also with IonQ’s stock, which was not endangered. In January 2025, Jensen Huang’s declaration created a sharp drop in value for all these stocks and they rebounded relatively fast afterwards, then fell down again, and are up again since the beginning of March 2025. What was the rationale here? You may wonder. Google Willow advancements had no connection at all with IonQ’s roadmap. Rigetti is a direct technology competitor of Google, but lagging behind it. And D-Wave? It’s been struggling for a while at generating some decent revenue. And the company is now over 25-year old. It seems to be a rare case of a company losing money for such a long time, although it became public only in 2022. These stock values are driven by a mix of volatile human sentiments and machine-based automated triggers. Chart showing Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave stock value evolution over one sliding year (source). Now let’s have some fun and look at the roadmaps, past revenue forecasts and actual results for these traded companies, which all went public using the shady SPAC funding vehicle. Rigetti’s 2021 roadmap announced that they would obtain a “broad quantum advantage” in 2025. How many use cases do they have with their 84-qubit QPUs? Not many, besides some QEC experiment with Riverlane announced in October 2024. Their qubit quality is too bad to do useful NISQ stuff, even with using quantum error mitigation. Their revenue projection was $73M for 2024 and $288M for 2025. In March 2025, they reported a revenue of $10.7 for 2024, while 2023 was at $12M. And a loss of $201M! D-Wave’s 2022 investor presentation was forecasting a revenue of $72M in 2024 and $219 for 2025. Actual revenue for 2024 was $8.8M while 2023 was at $8.7M. Not stellar exponential growth either! In its 2021 investor presentation, IonQ planned to reach 64 “algorithmic qubits” by 2025 with a 16:1 error-correction encoding, meaning a thousand physical qubits if I count well. And 2024 revenues of $60M. The actual was not that far, with $43M, although, mostly thanks to US federal commitments from AFRL. And they currently have only 36 operational qubits. The wake-up call for investors is hard, as shown in Kerrisdal Capital’s recent short-selling and well-documented report! Now, they just acquired IDQ with a $250M stock swap with SK Telecom. The rationale? Revenue diversification and patent portfolio consolidation! That’s not a pretty picture from the investor standpoint. We must recognize that all startups have the same problem. They make inflated sales forecasts to attract investors and then usually fail to deliver it. The big difference here is that this is not linked to some sales or competition shortcomings, or lack of some viral effects like in web consumer space, but because the technology is not yet there to capture the target market. Still, the market value of these companies totals over $10B ($3.15B for D-Wave, $2.75B for Rigetti, and $5.41B for IonQ). I have observed how IonQ investors on X were disappointed by the company’s quarterly results. Seemingly, they didn’t talk much with scientists and technology specialists to forge an educated opinion about the company. All investors are misled by a superposition of over-expectations: on the potential business value of quantum computers (culprits: McKinsey and BCG), on the related revenue opportunity (culprits: same folks), on the technology roadmap (culprits: most vendors and analysts, including Google and Microsoft), and on the difficulty of creating useful quantum computers. In comparison, IBM looks like a sane player, being more careful with its promises and roadmaps. Now, these three traded companies are not the best-in-class QPU vendors around. There are many other vendors who are not yet traded. Some are advancing their R&D quietly, avoid overselling their hardware, and adopt a long-term ploy. They benefit from a mix of private and public funding, including public procurements like with the EuroHPC program in the European Union. Conclusion The quantum scene is becoming the theater of double-speak with utility, use case, industry-grade, acceleration, if, and when, where the present and the future collide in the public discourse. Thanks for reading this paper until the end. What key question did I miss out?

Title: Don't call it a recession — but bad vibes are back in a big way
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tariffs-inflation-recession-fears-consumer-sentiment-doge-layoffs-economy-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-19T08:02:01Z

Americans aren't thrilled about the economy. Business Insider has heard from retirees watching their investments fluctuate in the stock market, parents struggling with the high cost of groceries and childcare, and business leaders bracing for a downturn. This comes alongside the Trump administration's roller-coaster tariff announcements and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The US may not be in a recession yet — but we are in a vibecession. This growing distrust could have serious consequences, as a fear-driven pullback in spending is one step toward an actual downturn. Cynical shoppers may avoid nonessential purchases, businesses could pause hiring, and investors might step back from the market. And the slower the economy, the weaker it becomes. "There's a massive amount of uncertainty that's really weighing on people," said Joanne Hsu, who oversees the closely watched University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which in March dropped to its lowest point in three years. "People are really worried that these policies are going to lead to a resurgence in inflation. We're seeing a deterioration in views related to the overall economy, which is related to personal finances, inflation, and most critically, labor markets." The vibecession rears its head whenever Americans are feeling particularly uncertain about the economy. Even if the major economic indicators aren't alarming on paper, rapid changes on Wall Street and in the White House historically make consumers and businesses nervous. Many consumers are worried about how federal policy will shape the cost of essentials such as groceries and housing. The Consumer Sentiment Index — which is based on surveys and interviews with hundreds of US adults by researchers at the University of Michigan — decreased by 16.1 points between December and March. That's the sharpest three-month drop since the pandemic began in 2020. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has climbed over 60 points since December, a much higher-than-typical jump. The measure is based on how often major media outlets are reporting on economic uncertainty, the frequency of disagreement among economic forecasters, and other factors. The research firm Civiqs also found that over a quarter of Americans believe the economy is doing "very bad" right now. Google searches for "recession" have spiked in the past 30 days. Among consumers, Trump is losing ground on what has historically been his — and the GOP's — strongest issue. The majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second-term job performance on the economy (54% disapprove) and how he's handling inflation and cost of living (55% disapprove), per an NBC News poll published March 16. "If people both think the economy is deteriorating and they expect their own incomes to weaken as well, it's hard to imagine how robust consumer spending can really be under those circumstances," Hsu said. Businesses aren't escaping the vibescession either. Many CEOs and executives are worried that the economic uncertainty will put a damper on profits, hiring, and growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that general business conditions, new orders and shipments, employment levels, and financial optimism have all declined among businesses across the state in 2025. "Small businesses have particularly few options and little wiggle room to deal with the sheer size of the tariffs in the pipeline," Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, told BI in an email. "They both squeeze profits margins and prompt cuts to staff, while boosting prices." At the C-Suite level, some companies' plans for hiring and capital investment, as well as sales projections, have decreased since Trump's inauguration, a survey of 150 CEOs by Business Roundtable found. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the March survey report that the downward trends are based on "several factors, including signs of economic headwinds and an atmosphere of uncertainty in Washington." Vibecessions aren't new. Consumer sentiment also dipped during and shortly after the pandemic and again ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Instability in the stock market, high inflation, and job losses often lead to widespread financial anxiety. Still, Americans' current pessimism about the economy is notable. The present vibecession comes in the context of declines in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq in recent weeks. While the markets have shown some signs of recovery, they remain well below their February highs. Trump's steep — and quickly shifting — tariff policies have also left US businesses and consumers expecting a significant jump in prices for things like food, construction materials, electronics, and alcohol. Inflation has eased from its post-pandemic highs, but many shoppers feel like their budgets are stretched thin. The chaos around the availability and cost of eggs, for example, has become a symbol of overall inflation fears. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have added to that uncertainty by firing thousands of federal workers and slashing the budgets of several government programs. Layoffs also hit major companies like Meta, Amazon, Southwest, and others in rapid succession, further fueling the public's perception of economic turmoil. This comes as the white-collar job market has been increasingly difficult to break into, despite overall unemployment rates holding steady. Hsu told BI that consumer sentiment patterns typically fall along party lines — Democrats feel more economically confident when the president is a Democrat, and Republicans more confident under Republican administrations. But in the past few months, consumer sentiment has significantly declined among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. The US isn't in a true recession. Economists and financial analysts told BI that economic downturns are measured on several factors, including long-term labor market and consumer spending data. A few weeks of stock market and policy instability aren't enough to call a recession. Still, even if the US economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession changes consumer behavior. People are likely to tighten their spending on nonessentials and delay major purchases, which could disrupt the travel industry and the housing market. Some small businesses and major corporations have also signaled that they plan to pass the price of Trump's tariffs onto consumers, which could contribute to shoppers buying less. "Moral of the story is that when uncertainty spikes, we tend to err on the side of caution and delay big spending decisions," Swonk said. "We are seeing that base emotion play out in real time in the overall economy." Retirees and hopeful retirees told BI that they are adjusting their stock market and 401(k) investments to be more conservative. Hsu said job seekers may also become less likely to leave their current jobs or seek outside promotions, affecting labor market churn. The stock market has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, but America's latest vibecession isn't over — and the future is hard to predict. "We're in a really unprecedented policy environment," Hsu said. "With policy changing every day, and every hour in some situations, it's really hard for consumers to plan in a meaningful way."

Title: German fiscal plan boosts European stocks

German equities closed higher on Tuesday, lifting European markets in general after the parliament approved plans for a large spending surge, while investors awaited details from a call between US and Russian leaders with a potential Ukraine peace deal on the line. The blue-chip index closed up 1 per cent after hitting an intraday record high. The domestically-exposed small-cap index climbed 3 per cent to a more than three-year high, while mid-caps were up 1.6 per cent. Germany’s Bundestag approved the reforms that include a major rollback of the so-called debt brake to increase defence spending, and a €500 billion fund for infrastructure. They will be presented to the upper house on Friday. The optimism around the reforms has resulted in a rally in defence stocks, the euro and euro zone yields in recent weeks, although they all pared gains after the vote. “It’s probably been a case of buy the rumour and sell the facts, where the German market has done so much better than everything else. There’s a little bit of profit taking,” said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter. Dublin Ires Reit fell 0.9 per cent after the State’s largest private residential landlord said it had refinanced its existing €500 million revolving credit facility in a deal that will leave its annual interest rate at 3.8 per cent, unchanged from 2024. AIB and Bank of Ireland trended up – by 1.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively – along with many of Europe’s financials. Glanbia in contrast was down again, closing the session at €10.40. The Kilkenny-based food giant, which has a large US operation, has been struggling since an earnings downgrade last month. Home builder Glenveagh was up again – rising by 1.6 per cent – following on from last week’s positive results. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.6 per cent with European banks leading gains, up 2.5 per cent. The banks index touched its highest level since February 2011, on higher spending prospects. Energy and automobile and parts shares followed, with most sectors ending the day in the green, as the European benchmark index outperformed Wall Street. Investors also awaited details from a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. attempts to convince Moscow to accept a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine. Computacenter jumped 11 per cent after the technology and services provider said it was well placed for progress in 2025, with a strong order backlog across all regions. Bollore lost 5.4 per cent after the French conglomerate reported full-year results. Siemens gained 1.2 per cent after the engineering company said it would cut 5,600 jobs from its flagship digital industries business. London The FTSE 100 rose on Tuesday while US stocks slipped, as markets looked ahead to interest rate calls from both countries’ central banks later in the week. The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve are poised to announce their latest decisions on interest rates, with traders expecting both to hold rates at their current levels. In the UK, policymakers have been gradually cutting borrowing costs since August last year, easing pressure on some borrowers who have seen lower mortgage rates enter the market. But the bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has stressed a “gradual and careful approach” to reducing rates. London’s blue-chip index rose 25 points to finish the day at 8,705, a 0.3 per cent rise. In company news, Close Brothers said it swung to a loss after setting aside £165 million (€196 million) in provisions for the motor finance commission scandal. Shares in the company slumped by 21.8 per cent after it posted a statutory pretax loss of £103.8 million for the six months to January 31, against profits of £87 million a year ago. New York Wall Street’s main indexes were lower on Tuesday on worries about the economic impact of US tariff policies ahead of a monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s two-day rate-setting meeting kicks off on Tuesday, and expectations are that the central bank will keep interest rates steady, according to data compiled by LSEG. Several US central bank officials have cautioned against hasty moves and said they would wait for data to see the impact of tariffs before making any policy shifts. “I don’t think they (Fed) know exactly how this (trade policy) is going to play out,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. Markets were taking a pause after all three major indexes gained more than 2 per cent each over the past two sessions as investors capitalised on discounted US equities following last week’s sell-off. The S&P 500 had tumbled more than 10 per cent from its February peak, signsignalling benchmark index entered a correction phase. The blue-chip Dow is trading close to correction levels, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirmed it is in a correction on March 6th. In company news, Alphabet fell 3 per cent after the company said it would buy Wiz for about $32 billion (€29 billion) in its biggest deal as the Google parent doubles down on cybersecurity. Nvidia declined 2.3 per cent. The company is expected to reveal details of its latest AI chip at its annual software developer conference. Tesla fell 4.2 per cent after brokerage RBC trimmed its price target on the EV maker’s stock, flagging the company is losing market share in China and Europe. Other megacaps slid, with Amazon losing 1.8 per cent and Meta down 4.3 per cent. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Google's splashy cybersecurity deal is a dud with investors. They're more focused on the economy.

Investors have met Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz with a collective yawn. Shares of parent-company Alphabet dropped as much as 5% on Tuesday following the deal announcement. The deal is seen as an attempt by Google to close the gap between itself and mega-cap cloud competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. But rather than react to a potentially transformative deal, investors elected to focus on economic-slowdown fears. These concerns stem largely from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, with uncertainty around tariffs clouding forecasts for corporate activity and economic expansion. Rumblings of a possible recession have gotten louder, leading to risk-off sentiment that recently pushed the benchmark S&P 500 into correction territory. Alphabet's share decline comes alongside a sell-off for the so-called Magnificent Seven. Tesla fell 5% to pace the group's losses, while Meta fell 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.8%. Investors will be watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting to determine how the central bank feels about the state of the economy. Virtually no investors expect an interest-rate cut at this meeting, though this could become a possibility down the road if the economic stimulus is needed. Jump to

Title: How Trump and Musk built their own reality

The presidents of the United States have gotten lost in the illusions they created. by Elizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The presidents of the United States have gotten lost in the illusions they created. by Elizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The putative president of the United States, Donald Trump, stood on the White House lawn. In his hand, he held a sales pitch for Tesla cars. The most powerful man in America, Elon Musk, attired for a very casual funeral and looking miserable, stood next to Trump. As Trump spoke, promising to buy a Tesla, Musk stood with his arms folded over his chest, giving the undeniable impression of a sulking toddler. Later, Trump threatened to label anyone vandalizing Teslas or Tesla dealerships domestic terrorists. The entire incident was, in its way, revelatory. A series of protests had targeted Tesla dealerships and owners, as Americans expressed their distaste for Musk, the unelected leader of the US. The instinct, in response to real behavior, was to create a media moment: a Tesla ad. One of the bizarre hallmarks of the Trump era is a set of elected officials who increasingly cannot tell apart spectacle and reality — as well as a group of voters who seem similarly confused. Take the Trump voter insisting that government agencies get tax cuts for DEI initiatives, as a baffled Sam Seder attempts to explain that, in fact, government agencies are what taxes are for, and thus are not taxed themselves. It seems the conservative mind cannot comprehend that DEI is, in fact, actually popular. To avoid acknowledging that, the voter summoned up a conspiracy theory that flies in the basic facts of governance, which he either does not know or does not care about. Confronted with a choice between a truth he doesn’t like and a fantasy, he has chosen the fantasy. The break with reality has been a long time coming — QAnon and Pizzagate preceded it — but in the pre-pandemic era, it was largely the fringes of the conservative movement. Now it is the main event. Faced with the horrors of mass death in 2020, a great many people have since apparently chosen to make a break with reality. That is now the basis of the conservative movement, as Mark Zuckerberg tacitly acknowledged when he abandoned fact-checking on Meta platforms. Requiring Trump supporters to stick to truth on social media would mean they could not post. And what has replaced truth? Spectacle. The proclivity for spectacle is the thing Musk and Trump truly have in common, though the media they target is different: Musk is an online guy, and Trump was forged in reality TV. Trump’s media instincts hew closer to professional wrestling — he has hosted two WrestleManias — and he appears to approach his cabinet as a kind of casting for Fox News. Is noted drunkard Pete Hegseth good at his job? Who cares, he looks good on television. Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, originated on The Real World, after all. Musk has similarly created an online profile of himself, largely as a marketing gimmick for Tesla. (Hey, did you hear that Robert Downey Jr modeled his portrayal of Tony Stark on Elon Musk?) In less dire times, he posted about mixing wine and Ambien as readily as he did about SpaceX missions — creating a fandom in the process. He is optimized for the attention economy; Musk may be outrageous, he may be insulting, he may be juvenile, but he is not boring. I am one of many journalists who had to follow his entire charade of taking Tesla private — which played out on Twitter, rather than in any boardroom. The spectacle works because pseudo-events are more exciting than reality; a normal budgetary meeting is a snooze, and normal diplomatic relations rely on closed doors, occurring out of sight of the average voter. Reality TV doesn’t work on this level — and keeping the viewers hooked is the main source of Trump’s and Musk’s respective power. The question is how long the spell will last. Is it possible for reality to be more interesting than the spectacle? Is there a point at which the horrors stop being entertainment? One of the basic problems of the modern world, and of mass media, is that most news events occur at a distance to a normal person and appear only through representation. The Tesla protests, for example, occur on TV or on TikTok for most people, side by side with fiction, and given equal epistemic weight. TV news itself allowed its seriousness to erode beginning in the 1970s, chasing ratings through entertainment. The main innovation of Fox News, besides its propagandistic tendencies, was Roger Ailes’ focus on making sure the channel was titillating rather than useful. (Ailes’ formula included a “leg cam” and plenty of blondes.) Fox News — the “news” part is best thought of as a dark joke — is a ratings bonanza because its primary focus is entertainment. The formula is adapted for television but is roughly the same as that detailed by David Foster Wallace’s 2005 profile of right-wing talk radio “Host”: keep the audience enraged, keep the audience engaged. This runs parallel to reality TV, which is not especially reality-based. Trump jumped to Fox News from The Apprentice and WWE with his instincts for keeping an audience fully formed. His first term was marked by a preoccupation with ratings — not approval, but television. Trump has long had a propensity to call into his favorite Fox News shows to ramble away — and his schedule during his first term was crammed full of “executive time,” which one might presume was his TV habit. “This is going to be great television.” This focus on TV hasn’t changed. Trump’s disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended with Trump telling Zelenskyy, “This is going to be great television.” Great television, of course, is not the same as great statecraft, and as a result of the meeting, European leaders pledged support for Ukraine. Trump is obsessed with invading Canada, and it appears to be because he doesn’t like seeing a wayward line on a map. This saber-rattling has got our mild-mannered northern neighbors boycotting US products. The maker of Jack Daniel’s says that Canada pulling US alcohol from store shelves to express their displeasure is “worse than tariffs.” Previous US leaders — starting with President John F. Kennedy — have also skillfully commanded television as a medium to suit their political ends. But those leaders seemed aware of the distinction between television and reality. For Trump, reality is whatever he says it is, which is then broadcast by Fox News back to him to confirm its truth. In his last term, even as Trump himself was sickened by the novel coronavirus, he insisted the pandemic was no big deal. After being taken by helicopter to a hospital, he made a series of public appearances where he was obviously ill and pretending not to be. Almost 400,000 people died from covid that year, according to death certificate information compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This may be the only way of explaining the bizarre economic policy coming from the White House. I don’t think Trump understands money — he’s filed for bankruptcy six times, hardly the sign of a successful businessman. But thanks to The Apprentice, he knows how to play a successful businessman on TV — by appearing domineering and decisive. The economy, however, occurs in reality rather than on TV, and in just 20 days of Trump’s flailing, the stock market has gone from all-time highs to an atmosphere of pure fear. The tariff threats, which Trump thinks make him sound powerful, are part of the problem, alienating trading partners and jacking up the price of ordinary goods. So, too, are Musk’s random firings of government workers under the guise of “efficiency.” Federal spending cuts also threaten everyone from farmers to retirees. Four airlines have cut their forecasts because they fear consumer confidence is waning. Sure, some of the economy — the stock market in particular, about which, more in a minute — can be shaped by narrative. The problem is a conflict of interest: the things that Trump thinks make him look strong to his voters also make the business community skittish. Consider his tariffs. They target some of America’s biggest imports and stand to make it harder to get your car repaired, assuming you can buy one at all. If the stock market continues to plunge, it’ll hit baby boomers squarely in their retirement savings, which will mean less spending overall. So, Trump is destroying the economy so he can look and feel tough — the sign of a man who’s confused about the difference between television and reality. His main source of funding, Musk, who has signaled he wants to buy more influence, is similarly confused. Musk’s problem isn’t TV, though. It’s the internet. Musk spent the last 10 years or so as the internet’s premier financial influencer, memeing Tesla’s stock to a bizarrely high price-earnings ratio through his Twitter antics. (Indeed, the platform was so important to him that he eventually bought it.) And while he has enough sense of reality to ransack the federal government in order to benefit SpaceX, meet with foreign leaders, and cut oversight of his companies, he is also striking poses for the benefit of X. Take, for instance, telling the foreign minister of Poland, “Be quiet, small man” on X. Poland has been paying for Starlink terminals used in Ukraine and has threatened to find another provider. As Trump and Musk blunder around the EU, alienating allies in order to cozy up to Russia, Musk’s Twitter fingers escalate the sense of panic. Not exactly what you want when the EU is considering rearming itself. Musk’s power is very real. He has control of the US Treasury — because while the courts have repeatedly ruled against him, those court orders need to be enforced to matter, and on several occasions, Musk and his goons have reportedly “vetoed” payments Trump has ordered. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts happen at his whim. That means that Republican officials call Musk directly to grovel. But they also publicly perform for Musk on X. Take Ed Martin, the US attorney, who has promised an X account claiming to be DOGE-affiliated that he will take action on “doxing.” Or Oklahoma senator James Lankford publicly begging for his pet ammunition plant to be spared DOGE cuts. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to get his attention. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to contact him Rather than attempting to reassert their constitutional power and decapitate DOGE, Republicans have chosen to abase themselves. “What we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,” said Lindsey Graham, the senator from North Carolina, according to CNN. He is the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, which, before Musk, was actually a fairly powerful position. Now it seems his job is to rubber-stamp Musk’s decisions. Musk’s key obsession appears to be “wokeness,” a smokescreen for dismantling the Civil Rights Movement. The weird conspiracy theories Musk is ingesting on X are guiding his cuts in the government, which have been haphazard and have, at times, resulted in the rehiring of fired employees after officials belatedly realized they were crucial. The cuts, which have not delivered Musk’s promised cost savings, have been justified through lies Musk and DOGE have promoted, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency housing migrants in luxury hotels. Musk is not so far gone that he can’t raid the government to suit himself. Appealing to the Trump base gives him cover to target agencies that will benefit him directly, such as NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Musk is effectively trying to create his own political reality, using X as a staging ground. The more noxious and viral the claims, the more useful they are to Musk. He is also attempting to destroy anything that might contract his constructed reality — which explains his war on Wikipedia. Wikipedia, a largely volunteer-run nonprofit, is a remarkably accurate encyclopedia — at least as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica, and maybe more so. It is a reference source available to anyone. And Musk loathes it. As long as it remains, anyone can check what he says and discover when he is wrong. He has hated that for a very long time. Despite Musk’s increasingly batshit public performance, which now includes a gesture that looks suspiciously like a Nazi salute, Republicans are too scared to criticize him. They know Musk can fund a primary challenge against them without breaking a sweat. So they’re stuck with Musk, who has been posting increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories to his X account. When X went down earlier this week, Musk claimed with no evidence that Ukraine was behind the company’s outage. Instead, hacking collective Dark Storm has taken credit for the disruption. Once upon a time, this all served a business purpose Musk has a long history of manipulating attention online — well before his chainsaw antics at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), his jumping jack at a Trump rally, or the alleged Sieg Heil. Twitter, when it was still called that, was how he created a fan base that hung on his every word. For at least the last decade, he’s been creating a reality-distortion field. Sometime around 2018 — I’d pinpoint it at his “pedo guy” defamation trial — Musk stopped being able to distinguish between his performances and reality. As this happened, the amount of time he spent posting on Twitter started to climb. Once upon a time, there was a business purpose: Twitter meant he didn’t have to do traditional advertising for Tesla; eventually, he built a profile big enough that he could just show up on TV shows like Saturday Night Live, while his competitors had to buy ads. But it seems Musk has become increasingly isolated, since his fame has made it difficult to appear in public. That means Twitter, now X, has been his main social outlet for some time, and it appears to have seriously warped him. At CPAC, when Musk, apparently zooted, mumbled something about “I am become meme,” he really, really meant it. It is, at times, difficult to know if Musk can distinguish fantasy from reality. Twitter is a far more poisoned well than cable news, and as Musk’s use has increased, his public statements have gotten increasingly weird. Musk has repeatedly suggested that Fort Knox’s gold is gone — never mind that in the last Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited the gold. Is this just red meat to the base? Does Musk want an excuse to be let into Fort Knox, to visit or even pocket the gold? Or did he read something on the darker recesses of Twitter and take it as truth? Musk has also claimed that there is wild fraud in Social Security, targeting it for the latest round of DOGE cuts. Musk has said that Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” which will doubtless be news to the many retirees who rely on it. Looks like Musk is attempting to create the conditions that would allow him to slash Social Security by inventing fraud wholesale. But it is possible, I suppose, that he is so brainrotted he really believes what he’s saying. The White House is currently claiming that Musk’s intent to meddle with Social Security won’t affect payments. We’ll see. The guy who’s posting memes calling people who receive it “the parasite class” doesn’t seem like he’s a careful steward of the program. And stiffing Social Security beneficiaries could add to Trump’s economic woes — as, once again, retirees cut spending. TV and X reproduce events that happen at a distance, which makes it easier for distortions to take hold. If someone tells me it is raining while I am standing in the sun, I know I am being lied to. But if someone tells me that the gold in Fort Knox has been stolen, I cannot check that directly. I have to trust intermediaries — the soldiers who guard the gold, the Treasury auditors who annually count it. As trust in institutions has been eroded, partly through the institutions’ own mistakes, conspiracy theories have run wild. Conspiracy theories are usually more entertaining than reality — a secret gold heist is so sensational that multiple movies have been made about it — but they also flatter the conspiracist, who now has secret knowledge. The flattering part, the secret knowledge, is what allows conspiracy theorists to continue to believe lies even in the face of actual, verifiable events. I’m not convinced Trump and Musk are tracking reality anymore, in part because, in reality, they look pretty ugly. Better to imagine themselves as their fans do: bold heroes, fighting for America — rather than gross authoritarians ransacking the country for personal benefit. As for their supporters, the erratic behavior, tariffs, abrupt firings, and tensions with Canada have some Michigan swing voters expressing reservations. These people are at least aware of economic reality. But right now, true believers in DOGE and Trump feel they are part of a community that is “saving” the US from, uhhhh, woke? Usually, lie-based belief systems are fragile — it’s hard to make the initial dent in the worldview, but once it happens, the whole thing shatters. The attacks on Tesla threaten Trump and Musk, and might be enough to shake some of their followers loose. They are also, and this is important, entertaining in a way that works against the pair. It is funny to listen to Cybertruck owners whine. It is even funnier to see the Cybertruck get stuck or have parts fall off. Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s reputation and spending power Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s business reputation — particularly since he’s supposedly the company’s CEO and yet is spending all of his time in the White House, securing fun new payouts for SpaceX. It also threatens his spending power, since most of Musk’s net worth is tied up in Tesla stock. Worse, a lot of that stock is pledged as collateral for loans. As of a 2024 SEC filing, about a third of Musk’s Tesla shares were pledged. If Tesla’s share price falls low enough, Musk has to pony up more shares or pay back some of his loans, which leaves him with less spending money for Trump and the Republicans. That loosens some of his grip on power. No wonder he’s panicking. The little demonstration on the White House lawn shows how much power Musk still has over Trump — because if Trump wanted to apply pressure to Musk, he wouldn’t make a public show of support. You can see, if you squint, what’s happening. Trump and Musk are trying to reframe the protest against Tesla dealerships (and indeed, Teslas themselves) as the “woke mob” — substituting into the roles that “antifa” and “Black Lives Matter” played in Trump’s last presidency. Footage of people protesting Tesla and leaving bags of dog shit on Cybertrucks can create a new enemy for Musk and Trump’s enemies to hate, letting them dodge anger for their actions that harm the economy and Social Security. The question is whether it’ll work. Cuts to Social Security and Medicaid have the potential to be dangerous to Musk — and therefore also to Trump. Both programs are popular, even with Republicans. Musk says he’s going to cut $700 billion, which may mean putting up new hurdles for people to receive their benefits — requiring more paperwork, say. Or it may mean cutting payments to doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. Either way, it’ll hit people who rely on both programs pretty quickly, as they are increasingly unable to access care. And it’s hard to blame that on former President Joe Biden when Musk is out here already taking credit for it. If grandma suddenly can’t see her doctor, we all know who’s to blame — Elon Musk, and the guy who put him in office, Donald Trump. I’m not sure any amount of “woke mob” posturing can undo that.

Title: Five reasons to expect a US equity recovery
URL: https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/comment/five-reasons-to-expect-a-us-equity-recovery/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T13:21:54Z
Full Content:
It appears US equities are getting caught up between Sino-US geopolitical tensions. Ironically, it is the under owned stocks in export sensitive economies, like China and the EU, that have prospered on expectations of greater fiscal spending brought about by Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda. On the US side, it seems that Trump’s trade protectionism agenda has backfired. The mighty US tech sector has seemingly lost its sheen, and the risk of a US recession has increased. The Atlanta Fed’s early read on real GDP for the first quarter of 2025 estimates a contraction of 2.4% at an annualised rate, the biggest decline since the pandemic-led lockdown. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Much of that decline comes from imports brought forward ahead of expected US tariff increases, which led to a large drag on GDP. It is not yet clear if this is just a temporary stalling in growth or something more significant. Final sales to domestic producers, a more specific measure of domestic private consumer demand that excludes exports, is still growing at a 0.8% rate, which is probably a better read of the health of the underlying economy. Trump may be placing greater importance on keeping the cost of government borrowing down at the expense of the equity market. That’s because Trump’s party, the Republicans, will be asking Congress over the coming months to raise the debt ceiling limit by over $4trn as part of a comprehensive legislative package to deliver on his domestic priorities. Trump will want to show that the US public debt market is stable ahead of a likely “Birthday Summit” with President Xi in June when both presidents celebrate their birthdays. Trump will want the Chinese to commit to buy more US Treasuries at that meeting. Furthermore, in an interview on Fox News on March 10, Trump appeared to talk down long-term interest rates by saying the US economy is experiencing a “period of transition”. That’s because he wants a weaker US dollar to support the competitiveness of US manufacturing. Indeed, Trump made this point in a speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 when he said, “We need a weaker dollar to bring back our manufacturing jobs. A strong dollar makes it difficult for our companies to compete globally”. Trump is also using the war in Ukraine, and the threat of removing financial and military support, as leverage to get European nations to step-up fiscal spending on defence and ideally, US military hardware. Following the recent German election, there is a desire from the leadership of the new incoming government to raise fiscal spending by reforming the so-called “debt brake” – a mechanism to ensure budget deficits are kept down on a structural basis. This includes more German public expenditure on infrastructure and an open-ended commitment to raise defence procurement. Essentially, this expansionary fiscal policy could narrow the US-European growth gap and give impetus for the euro to appreciate against the dollar. On the China side, Beijing is using a subtle response to Trump’s trade tariffs. President Xi’s recent meeting with Jack Ma, the co-founder of tech giant Alibaba, was choreographed to show the Tech sector has implicit approval from the Chinese political leadership. In addition, the release of DeepSeek (an AI model by a Chinese startup) in January did not help the US tech sector either. DeepSeek raises questions on whether US companies should be spending so much money on computing hardware. China is using its “soft power” to weaken US dominance in financial markets and its economy down a notch to strengthen the country’s negotiation hand ahead of an inevitable President Trump-Xi summit to discuss trade and investment. Arguably, the key takeaway for investors from recent Sino-US geopolitical tensions is that the US dollar has depreciated. This adds support for US stocks in several ways. First, they become cheaper for non-US investors. Second, fundamentally, a weaker US dollar should boost US multinationals’ profits from overseas when translated back home. And third, dollar weakness indicates that there is a greater supply of the currency than demand. Potentially, this creates favourable financial conditions for equities to recover from oversold levels should money flows back to risky assets. The recent US equity price falls mean valuations for the so-called US ‘Magnificent Seven’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) look more favourable. For instance, their aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a 40% premium compared to the rest of the US S&P 500, its lowest level since 2018.[1] Nvidia is trading on a valuation of 24 times earnings, which looks relatively attractive considering its high profit margins and potential for rapid growth in expected sales over the coming years from AI demand. The US 30-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.6%, down 0.4% points from a peak in mid-January. Fundamentally, given US mortgage rates are priced-off the long-term cost of government borrowing, less money is being spent on making interest payments, potentially giving a boost to the housing market to drive economic growth. Lower Treasury yields also support stocks by making equity valuations look more attractive to government bonds. Although it is early days, the ructions seen in equities does not appear to have dampened consumer expenditure. That’s because with inflation slowing and jobs being created, annual real take-home pay grew nearly 2% in January. Moreover, deregulation and expected tax cuts should drive hiring. The National Federation of Independent Business survey (a barometer of small business sentiment) shows that hiring intentions are at their highest level in over a year. Importantly, this should give consumers the confidence to shop. Providing the US economy continues to grow at a relatively healthy clip, this increases the chances that companies can deliver on consensus earnings’ expectations. As it stands the consensus expects MSCI USA earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 12.1% in 2025, a modest downgrade from 14.5% at the start of the year. However, in early January, EPS for 2026 has been revised up to 14.5% from 13.2%.[2] Overall, there has been little change in company earnings’ expectations when averaging out this year and next. To summarise, US equities have felt the brunt of uncertain China-US geopolitical tensions. On the upside, the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stock valuations have adjusted to more reasonable levels. The US dollar appears to have peaked to create favourable financial conditions for stocks. Moreover, the economic outlook remains encouraging, supported by consumption and the labour market, but with increased downside risks from policy uncertainty. Trump appears willing to tolerate volatile markets in the short term to achieve his longer-term goals of weakening the dollar and keeping the cost of government borrowing down to fund his domestic priorities. For that he will still need to find common ground with President Xi in the summer. Daniel Casalii is the Chief Investment Strategist at Evelyn Partners

Title: Microsoft's 1986 IPO

Full Content:
David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home » Retro Computing » Microsoft’s 1986 IPO On March 13, 1986, Microsoft shook up the financial world, and to some degree, we are still feeling the reverberations from that 40 years later. That was the day of Microsoft’s very successful IPO. The hunt for the next Microsoft began immediately, leading directly to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century. Microsoft’s IPO initially valued company at $21.00 per share. It raised $61 million for the company, and put its market capitalization at $777 million. The price peaked at $35.50 per share before settling to $27.75 at the end of the day. Microsoft expected it to take weeks to reach $27.75. Bill Gates owned 45% of the company’s stock, which meant on March 14, 1986, he was worth almost $350 million. He had not yet turned 31. The next year, he became the youngest person to become a billionaire, before he had turned 32. Founded in 1975, Microsoft was an 11-year-old company at the time it went public. They waited so long because Bill Gates wanted to maintain control over the company as long as he could. By 1986, Microsoft had to go public. This wasn’t because they needed money. Their profit margins were enviable, at 34% of their pre tax revenue. Microsoft didn’t need the $61 million the IPO raised. The reason Microsoft had to go public in 1986 was because Bill Gates had been using stock to attract talent. Microsoft projected that by sometime in 1987, they would have 500 shareholders, which would require Microsoft to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively turning them into a publicly traded company, but without the benefits of going public in the conventional way. Backed into this corner, Gates agreed in late 1985 to pursue an IPO. Motley Fool greatly oversimplifies Microsoft’s early years, as do others. They’re better at SEO than analysis. Microsoft’s best known products in 1986 were PC DOS and MS-DOS, the text-based operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible PCs. In 1986, Microsoft Windows existed, barely, but wasn’t yet successful. Microsoft’s secret was that virtually every computer on the market was running some Microsoft product. Its operating system powered the booming PC market. But Excel was the most popular spreadsheet on the Macintosh. Its predecessor, Multiplan, was a reasonably popular spreadsheet on other platforms. Microsoft Word was an up and coming word processor. Microsoft Basic was one of the most popular programming languages, and ran on virtually every platform. Sometimes Microsoft licensed software on a royalty basis and sometimes for a flat rate up front. Getting the flat rate up front shielded Microsoft from losing profits to piracy early on. But once Microsoft could afford to risk some loss to piracy, it was more profitable to take a royalty per unit sold. There were 60 million IBM and IBM-compatible PCs sold in the 1980s, and Microsoft collected a royalty on virtually every single one. Then in 1991, it discovered it could sell new versions of MS-DOS as upgrades and make money on each unit sold a second time. When Windows 3.0 hit the market in May 1990, the game was essentially over. Microsoft could sell you an operating system, a graphical environment, and versions of Word and Excel that ran in that environment, all running on commodity hardware that was getting cheaper by the quarter, if not the month. Although it would be a few years before other companies would give up, a monopoly in operating systems and office suites was inevitable before 1990 was over. The more successful Microsoft became, the more afraid of failure and anticompetitive it became. This led to legal issues in the late 1990s. Microsoft reformed to a degree and is more tolerant of certain competing products continuing to exist than it was in the 90s. Today, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (formerly Google) are larger than Microsoft, but the four companies are the only technology firms in the 2024 Fortune 20 list. The fifth largest technology firm is Meta, the social media company everyone loves to hate, at #30. To this day, young ambitious people enroll in school to get technical degrees in hopes of becoming the next Bill Gates, and venture capitalists like Kevin O’Leary and Marc Andreessen (himself a cofounder of a failed dotcom) prey on them. These ambitious programmer/entrepreneurs rarely get rich, but the venture capitalists have figured out how to make money even as the businesses they fund fail. Today’s entrepreneurs would do well to note that Microsoft made minimal use of venture capital. Microsoft’s only VC only owned 6.2 percent of the company. Gates didn’t trust them. If you’re thinking of trying your hand at being the next Bill Gates, keep that in mind. Another direct consequence of the Microsoft IPO was the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent recession. Fear of missing out on the next Microsoft drove up the value of anything tech- or Internet-related. Investors believed the next Microsoft would come out of that generation of companies. In the end they were kind of right. Two companies from that wave ended up matching and eventually eclipsing Microsoft. But it wasn’t exactly clear until a few years after the dotcom bust that Amazon and Google would be the ones to do it. Short-lived randos like VA Linux, Geocities, Cyberrebate, and Internet America were able to come along for the ride while the market shook out.

Title: Nvidia's AI empire: A look at its top startup investments | TechCrunch

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.

So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture. So, there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Fed meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.
