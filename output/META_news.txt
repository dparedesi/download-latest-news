Title: Google rolls out Android AI-powered features and updates for developers

UPDATED 13:00 EDT / OCTOBER 30 2025 by Kyt Dotson Google LLC’s Android division today announced several artificial intelligence-powered features aimed at Android developers, offering powerful ways to build advanced intelligent apps for mobile and other devices. Among the new features, Android developers can now easily unlock powerful on-device AI with Google Nano, the company’s relatively tiny large language model, and access image generation alongside updates to agentic “vibe coding” capabilities in Android Studio. Android Studio, the official dedicated development environment for Android apps, received updates to its AI agent capabilities using Gemini, Google’s flagship LLM. The recently launched Agent Mode allows developers to describe complex tasks and goals in plain language, which the AI agent plans and then delivers the changes. Google said the agent’s answers and capabilities are now grounded in the most modern development practices, allowing it to cross-reference the latest documentation in real-time. This enables it to upgrade application programming interfaces on the developer’s behalf. Google also unveiled a new project assistant and the ability to bring any LLM to power Android Studio’s AI functionality. Developers will now be able to shape and guide the output from Gemini Nano, a small AI model designed for consumer devices such as smartphones, by passing in any prompt with a new Prompt API, now in early alpha mode. Gemini Nano’s small size makes it suitable for running on-device. This enables developers to build applications that do not need to contact the cloud to perform generative AI operations — enhancing both security and privacy. Kakao used the Prompt API capability to change how its parcel delivery service works by replacing the manual process where users had to copy and paste details into a form with a simple message that requests delivery. The API automatically extracts all the necessary information. This change reduced order completion time by 24% and boosted new user conversion by 45%. Cloud-based AI solutions with Firebase AI Logic, a set of tools and services that allow developers to integrate AI models into their apps, now support image generation models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, also known as Nano Banana, and Imagen, Google’s high-powered professional image generator. Nano Banana offers advanced image creation and editing features, allowing users to select and manipulate specific areas of an image. Imagen delivers mask-based editing where users can block out part of an image and have the model modify it. Google said it plans to release an LLM benchmark in the coming months that will reflect how capable various AI models and providers are for Android development. The benchmark is composed of real-world problems sourced from public GitHub Android repositories. It will have an LLM recreate a pull request, which is then verified by human-authored tests. This will measure how efficient and suitable an LLM is for navigating complex codebases, understand dependencies and solving everyday problems for developers. Google is finalizing the results from the benchmark and will release the results publicly in an attempt to provide clear guidance to developers on current LLM capabilities. In addition to AI updates, Google also noted last week’s launch of the first in a new wave of virtual reality devices using the company’s Android XR operating system. The first device to ship is from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.: the Galaxy XR, a mixed-reality headset built in partnership with Google. Android XR devices ship with Gemini AI capabilities embedded and are designed on top of Android frameworks using Qualcomm Technologies Inc. chipsets. The new device launched with a price tag of $1,799.99. It provides virtual and mixed reality capabilities for work and entertainment. Users can light up virtual workspaces that float in their vision, watch movies on giant virtual screens and play immersive video games that interact with and react to their environment. “With Galaxy XR, Samsung is introducing a brand-new ecosystem of mobile devices,” said Won-Joon Choi, chief operating officer of mobile experience business at Samsung Electronics. Samsung said the Galaxy XR is the first in a long-term journey, with upcoming innovative devices in the pipeline across the full spectrum of form factors, including AI-enabled smart glasses. This puts Samsung in the running against Meta Platforms Inc., which recently debuted Meta Ray-Ban Display, which includes a built-in display on the right lens, and Apple Inc., which reportedly plans to launch augmented reality smart glasses in 2026.

Title: Amazon Is Set To Report Earnings Today. Here's What Investors Should Know
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-is-set-to-report-earnings-today-what-investors-should-know-11840316
Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:55:58Z

Amazon is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday, and all eyes are likely to be on the e-commerce giant’s cloud business. Amazon is expected to report third-quarter revenue of about $178 billion, a 12% increase from last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Its earnings are expected to increase 10% to $1.57 a share. While Amazon’s e-commerce operation makes up the bulk of its business, investors will be most focused on its AI efforts, represented by cloud revenue and capital expenditures. Amazon’s cloud growth of 17.5% in the second quarter exceeded official expectations, but disappointed Wall Street after two blowout reports from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). On Wednesday, both of those companies again posted cloud revenue well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, setting another high bar for Amazon to clear. Amazon's array of businesses spans e-commerce, logistics, advertising, cloud computing and more, making its results a partial reflection of the financial health of U.S. consumers and businesses. Its market capitalization—well over $2 trillion as of midday Thursday—makes its stock one of the most influential in the stock market. Investors may also be primed for Amazon to increase its capital expenditures guidance after Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META) did so with their reports Wednesday. Amazon’s second-quarter capex of $32.2 billion was about 25% higher than analysts expected. Wedbush analysts expect Amazon’s full-year capex to total $119 billion, implying growth of about 10% between the first and second halves of this year. “We are constructive on the setup leading into the report given positive commentary around [Amazon Web Services] growth, healthy trends for the core retail business, and strong advertiser demand,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a note late last week. Amazon stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven recently, with shares up just 3% since the start of the year. Concerns about tariffs and lagging cloud growth have weighed on the stock. Some investors see the potential for shares to close the gap with the rest of the Mag 7 after earnings. Options prices on Thursday morning suggest traders expect Amazon stock to move about 6.3% in either direction by end of the week. A move higher off of Wednesday’s closing price would put shares around $244.75, which would be their first all-time high since early February, while an equivalent decline would put the stock at about $216. Wall Street is generally bullish on the outlook for Amazon stock, with all 22 of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha assigning it a “Buy” rating. Their median price target of $270 is nearly 20% above the stock’s intraday price on Thursday. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect analysts’ estimates for Amazon's diluted earnings per share.

Title: Meta Platforms Enters Oversold Territory

ByDividend Channel, Contributor. The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Meta Platforms presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors. 10 Oversold Dividend Stocks » But making Meta Platforms Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of META entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $650.17 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Meta Platforms Inc, the RSI reading has hit 26.1 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 47.2. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, META's recent annualized dividend of 2.1/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 0.28% based upon the recent $751.67 share price. A bullish investor could look at META's 26.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on META is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Title: Investors are growing skeptical of colossal AI-spending plans by tech giants like Meta and Microsoft

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mega-cap tech firms keep spending loads of cash on AI — and investors are starting to rebel. That was evident after Meta and Microsoft — two of the largest companies at the center of the AI revolution — saw their stock prices drop on Wednesday, after earnings. The catalyst for the losses was newly announced plans from both companies to spend even more on AI in the next year, despite colossal amounts that have already been poured into the AI race. Meta said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion on AI capex in 2025, up from its previous guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company would spend even more on AI in 2026, driven largely by infrastructure costs. Shares of the Facebook parent dropped as much as 14% on Thursday. Microsoft had a similar moment when it reported earnings on Wednesday. The software giant said it spent a record $34.9 billion on capex in the past quarter, up from the $24.2 billion the prior quarter, and said spending could increase in 2026. Shares of Microsoft dropped 3% at intraday lows on Thursday. Confidence in the AI trade has grown increasingly fragile. Talk about a stock market bubble is growing as investors assess massive gains in the market in recent years. They're also aware that monetization plans for AI remain unclear, despite buckets of cash that have already been poured into chips and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google could spend as much as $320 billion on capex primarily related to AI infrastructure this year, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Some investing pros are worried that the ambitious AI spending plans are a parallel to previous market fads that have fizzled out. Meta, for instance, poured billions of investment into the metaverse several years ago, a concept that markets eventually moved on from and led the company to report billions in losses. Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, called the latest stock drops in Meta and Microsoft a "yellow flag" for the AI trade. In a recent note to clients, he said a possible warning for the AI trade could be when a large mega-cap tech company announces plans to spend more on capex, though its stock price drops as a result. He told BI he expected to see that play out among more tech firms in the future, which would constitute a clearer warning that the AI hype is starting to deflate. "When Zuck comes out and says, we're making all these investments based on the best-case scenario for AI because we don't want to be left behind — that's dangerous, right? Because if you don't get that best-case scenario, you are going to have pretty significant write-offs," Berezin said. Jump to

The benchmark US stock market indices opened lower on Thursday after mixed tech results and a hawkish Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 opened in the red, trading 0.56% or 38.44 points lower at 6,852.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened nearly 1% or 227.21 points lower at 23,731.26, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 0.17% or 81.27 points lower to trade at 47,550.73. As of 7:35 p.m., the S & P 500 fell 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.69%, while Dow Jones erased losses to trade 0.37% higher. The share price of Meta Platforms tanked more than 12% in the early minutes of trade after the giant's rating was humbled by Oppenheimer to 'perform' from 'outperform' on account of its heavy AI spending. The Facebook and Instagram parent reported revenue growth of 26% that beat market estimates, but that jump was outpaced by a 32% increase in costs. Other major names like Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. also traded in the red, 0.51% and 2.16% lower respectively. The grass was greener for other market titans like Apple Inc., which traded 0.60% higher. Oracle's stock also traded 2.30% lower at $269.23 on Thursday after the US market opened.

Title: AI valuations and market volatility: What leasing sector boardrooms need to know
URL: https://www.leasinglife.com/comment/ai-valuations-and-market-volatility-what-leasing-sector-boardrooms-need-to-know/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T13:38:15Z

The Bank of England’s recent warning about an overheated AI stock market should give leasing-sector boardrooms serious pause for reflection. In its October 2025 Financial Stability Report, the central bank flagged ‘stretched valuations’ in tech and AI stocks and warned of increased vulnerability to a sharp correction. While this might sound like a distant capital markets issue, it has relevance for the leasing and asset finance industry. As a technology partner to global finance and leasing companies in the United Kingdom, in Europe and across the world, NETSOL offers the following perspective on what’s unfolding and how to respond. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more What makes today’s AI-driven investment boom particularly fragile is the deep interconnectedness between a few dominant players. Partnerships between NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft and others have created a tightly bound ecosystem: chipmakers supply compute power, cloud giants host models and AI firms build software layers on top. Capital, infrastructure and R&D are deeply intertwined, regularly investing in one another. In fact, only seven tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, Tesla, Microsoft and Alphabet, now account for roughly 30 % or more of the S&P 500 by market‑capitalisation. What this means is that almost all of the index’s growth is being driven by these ‘Magnificent Seven’, who are themselves leveraging the AI boom to reshape, and in some cases dominate, the world economy. This means that a shock to one major player, whether through valuation collapse, infrastructure failure or regulatory action, could cascade throughout the ecosystem. And because many leasing firms are now using AI, whether directly within their operations or indirectly through the technologies they finance, any major disruption in the AI ecosystem could have a tangible impact across the sector. Despite its potential, much of the AI sector’s sky-high valuations are not backed by real, sustainable cashflows. NVIDIA stands out as a powerful exception, posting record-breaking profits on the back of unprecedented demand for its chips, yet this success contrasts sharply with others in the ecosystem. OpenAI, for instance, is attempting to convert its roughly 700 million users from free to paid at an estimated 2% rate, with no clear path toward the ambitious $200 billion revenue target it has set for 2030. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. It’s not just investor enthusiasm driving these prices – it’s speculative belief in future transformation. That may be valid in the long run, but from a governance standpoint, it qualifies as a classic asset bubble. Boardrooms should recognize this disconnect: if the cash doesn’t support the valuation, the correction can be severe, especially in capital-intensive industries like leasing, where technology adoption cycles and ROI timelines are longer. Not all AI players are heading in the same direction, which introduces uncertainty. For example: OpenAI has announced it will soon allow adult content generation in ChatGPT for verified users, with a tactical move aiming to boost monetisation through consumer engagement. Anthropic, by contrast, is doubling down on enterprise AI, targeting regulated industries and B2B productivity tools. These divergent strategies reflect monetisation pressure and reveal how unsettled the business models behind AI still are. This matters for leasing firms betting on AI-enhanced platforms: some tools may not survive if their creators fail to monetise them effectively. A correction won’t end the AI era, but it will reshape the competitive and capital landscape. Boardrooms should anticipate the following developments: Consolidation at the bottom: Smaller or venture-backed AI startups without clear paths to revenue will either shut down or be absorbed by larger players. This could disrupt vendors, APIs or tech-stack integrations in leasing platforms. Capital redirected to less-exotic, high-fundamentals ventures: Investors will pivot toward services with clearer ROI. For example, platforms that enhance operational efficiency, customer experience or asset management, rather than experimental consumer tools. Pricing pressure on large AI firms: With monetisation under pressure and low conversion rates (for example, OpenAI’s free-to-paid users remain in the single digits), big players may cut prices or chase aggressive user acquisition. This could create risk for those leasing or integrating AI-linked platforms whose economics rely on sustained premium pricing. At the same time, operational costs for these platforms may decrease. For example, a lower price per million tokens, which could offer some relief or efficiency gains for users. More scrutiny on business outcomes: The AI tools that survive and thrive will be those that deliver measurable value i.e. improved residual forecasting, automated customer service and predictive maintenance. Not just hype. Is there one item that impacts the leasing industry? Even if small. May be not. Even if a bubble bursts, AI innovation itself will not slow down. Research from the Oliver Wyman Forum shows that industry leaders are already capturing measurable gains, in some cases, over 10% improvements in revenue or cost efficiency. These companies aren’t experimenting; they’re transforming operations at scale. Productivity and scalability remain key issues for most leasing companies and AI will inherently bring much-needed gains that drive improved shareholder returns. That’s the key takeaway for the leasing sector: a correction in market sentiment doesn’t mean AI stops delivering value. But it does mean that capital, strategy and partnerships will pivot toward grounded, ROI-driven solutions. NETSOL advises leasing and asset finance leaders to take the following actions in light of the Bank of England’s warning: We believe the leasing sector is entering a critical phase. The promise of AI is real, and for many of our clients, already impactful. But boardrooms must balance optimism with risk awareness. The Bank of England is right to issue a warning. But the right response isn’t retreat. It’s disciplined innovation. Lease smarter. Digitize with intent. Prioritize tools that tie directly to operational performance and financial returns. And above all, remember: the future belongs to those who prepare, not just predict.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are losing ground amid a barrage of earnings reports from major companies, as investors assess the latest developments in trade talks and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's warning that more rate cuts aren't a certainty; President Donald Trump said his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping resulted in a rare earths mineral agreement and a reduction in certain tariffs on China; shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are losing ground after the Magnificent Seven members reported results late yesterday, while Alphabet (GOOG) shares are surging after the Google parent reported more than $100 billion in quarterly sales; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are due to release their quarterly reports after the closing bell; and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the company reported strong sales of weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it." The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week. President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates. Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%.. More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models. Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

Title: 5 Shopify Mistakes That Kill Holiday Profits
URL: https://www.practicalecommerce.com/5-shopify-mistakes-that-kill-holiday-profits
Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:42Z

Minor configuration mistakes during the busy Christmas selling season can seriously harm ecommerce profits. Shopify remains the most popular ecommerce platform in the United States. Various sources report that the company has about 29% of the total U.S. hosted ecommerce platform market, or about 21% of the top 1 million ecommerce sites worldwide. Shopify is popular, in part, because of its relative ease of use. The setup is speedy for online sellers willing to accept out-of-the-box themes and a default configuration. Unfortunately, that configuration can also lead to mistakes. What follows are five Shopify setup errors that kill profits when holiday sales rev up. Product feeds to Google and Meta can fail silently. A price mismatch, missing GTIN, or out-of-stock flag can lead to disapprovals that stop some ads from running even while the campaign spends otherwise. Before the holiday rush, store owners and managers should review product feeds aimed at dynamic advertising. In Shopify, this means checking “Google & YouTube,” “Facebook & Instagram,” and any other connected sales app. Each should show products approved and synchronized. A merchant might also notice this when checking product sales channels. Shopify adds a warning if there is a feed problem. A store manager checking for missing channels (below) might have noticed something wrong with the “Google & YouTube” feed. Shopify merchants sometimes assume that publishing a product to their online store automatically makes it visible on Google Shopping, Meta, the Shop app, and Pinterest. It does not. Shopify treats each sales channel separately, and products do not appear in a channel unless explicitly added. This may be true even when an app is installed correctly. Channel exclusion happens frequently for stores selling print-on-demand products such as t-shirts. A shopkeeper might design and publish a t-shirt with Printful and add it to a Shopify collection, unaware that it wasn’t added to every channel. To check, go to “Products” in Shopify and filter by excluded sales channels. Bulk-add any missing channels. Visibility is a foundation of conversion. If an item is not syndicated to every active channel, it might as well not exist. Shopify’s shipping options are flexible and configurable. They can be confusing, too, prompting some ecommerce operations to select a few simple options. Unfortunately, keeping it simple may not work during the holiday crunch. Last-minute holiday shoppers often want lightning-fast delivery and are willing to pay for it. The trouble is that many stores never offer it. In Shopify, go to “Settings” > “Shipping and Delivery.” Open each profile and make sure every product belongs to it. Add at least one two-day or overnight option using carrier-calculated rates. Consider posting a clear cutoff message — such as “Order by Dec. 18 for Christmas delivery.” — on product detail pages. Fast, flexible fulfillment often matters more than price in late December. Shoppers will not buy without a proper delivery option. Shopify’s discount system is powerful and literal. Run multiple promotions at once, and the platform could apply them all unless told otherwise. Ensure discounts work as expected. To be clear, applying multiple discounts to a single order, product, or transaction simultaneously is a valid sales tactic. Plenty of retailers use this approach. Hence discount stacking is built into Shopify. A storewide 20% sale, combined with free shipping and a loyalty code, can materially boost holiday revenue and, potentially, instantly erase margins. Before launching any campaign, open “Discounts” and check for overlapping date ranges or stackable coupons. Consider limiting the store to one automatic or sitewide discount at a time — test checkouts with several products in the cart. Merchants on Shopify Plus may also want to audit their Scripts or Functions. Strong Christmas sales can push a store past tax nexus thresholds — the point at which a merchant is legally required to collect and remit sales tax in a state. Shopify doesn’t necessarily detect new tax requirements automatically. The store may owe taxes if its revenue or transaction volume crosses a given state’s threshold. The problem usually shows up after December, when accountants discover a state in which the store met the threshold but never registered. That missed setup can mean back taxes, penalties, and months of cleanup. Before peak season, review Shopify tax settings. Add every state where the business has physical presence, employees, warehouses, or meets an economic nexus threshold. That threshold is often $100,000 in annual sales or 200 transactions. Enable Shopify Tax or a third-party app such as Avalara to maintain accurate rates. International stores should check “Markets” to confirm the correct VAT and customs settings.

Title: Microsoft's massive AI spending draws investor concerns
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1030/1541263-microsofts-massive-ai-spending-draws-investor-concerns/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:23Z
Full Content:
Microsoft's AI infrastructure spending to meet growing cloud services demand is outpacing Wall Street expectations, deepening investor fears about the costs of sustaining the boom. The technology giant reported a record capital expenditure of nearly $35 billion for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday and warned spending would rise this year, in a reversal of its earlier prediction that it would moderate. Microsoft's shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading. Alphabet and Meta Platforms also warned of higher spending as Big Tech works to overcome capacity bottlenecks that have hampered companies' ability to fully cash in on booming AI demand. But the rising spending, as well as soaring valuations of tech companies and limited evidence of productivity gains for businesses adopting AI, has raised fears of a bubble reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com boom -- and collapse. Key Microsoft partner and ChatGPT creator OpenAI is also at the center of a web of circular deals and has committed to buy more than $1 trillion in computing power with little detail on how it will fund that purchase. Cloud revenue jumps For now, though, the outlay for Microsoft is paying off. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business grew 40% in the July-September period, outpacing Visible Alpha's estimate of 38.4%. The company's current-quarter Azure growth forecast of 37% was also slightly ahead of estimates of 36.4%. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts on a call that growth could have been higher without the capacity constraints, which Microsoft expects will continue at least until the end of its current fiscal year, in June 2026. Total revenue would be $79.5 billion to $80.6 billion in the current quarter, Microsoft said. Analysts polled by LSEG on average expected $79.95 billion. "The capex number was a little bit worrisome," Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options, said of the decline in Microsoft shares. Profit beat For the July-September quarter, Microsoft said total revenue rose 18% to $77.7 billion, beating expectations of $75.33 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Profit of $3.72 per share also beat expectations of $3.67. The results were not affected by a revised deal with OpenAI that Microsoft announced earlier this week. The arrangement gave Microsoft a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, as well as a cut of sales and access to intellectual property, clearing up uncertainty about the collaboration with the company synonymous with the AI boom. The partnership, which gives Microsoft exclusive access to the models behind ChatGPT, has been key to Azure's rapid growth in recent quarters and strengthened its challenge to top cloud provider Amazon.com. It is also crucial to Microsoft's other AI services, such as 365 Copilot for businesses. That AI push has turned Microsoft into the world's second-most-valuable firm with a $4 trillion market value, trailing only chip maker Nvidia, which made history when it hit a $5 trillion valuation on Wednesday. Microsoft's stock, up nearly 30% this year, is among the best performers in the "Magnificent 7." The after-hours drop in its share price, however, threatened its $4 trillion valuation. Some analysts have praised Microsoft's decision in recent months to let some OpenAI contracts go to Oracle, saying it shows discipline in steering limited AI capacity toward more profitable enterprise customers. The move is part of a broader strategy to lessen Microsoft's dependence on OpenAI by building its own models and partnering with other AI firms, including Anthropic. "We have to balance third-party demand with our own first-party needs, fund our own R&D, and build model capability," CEO Satya Nadella said on the analyst call on Wednesday. "Each time we say no to something (that doesn't serve our long-term interest) I feel better." © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Big Tech’s AI Bets: Mixed market reactions after Q3 earnings

Shares in three of the “Magnificent Seven” — Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta — moved in different directions in after-hours trading after they released their third-quarter results. The earnings once again underscored how artificial intelligence continues to dominate Big Tech’s growth story and investor sentiment. (Source: Reuters) Alphabet’s shares surged 6.2% after the Google parent beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue. Both its core advertising business and its cloud computing unit showed steady growth. The company also raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion, far above earlier projections of around $80 billion. Microsoft’s stock fell 3.4% in extended trading even after posting blockbuster growth in its cloud-computing business, which pushed its quarterly revenue past expectations. The results showed that businesses are still spending aggressively on AI services despite concerns about a potential bubble. Analysts noted that Microsoft’s heavy AI investments are now starting to deliver meaningful returns. Meta’s shares dropped more than 8% after the company reported a $16 billion one-time charge in the third quarter related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The social media giant also said its capital expenditure next year would be “notably larger” than in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading an AI talent hiring spree and plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in massive AI data centres for superintelligence. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the results were a mixed bag for markets. “The good reaction in Alphabet offsets Microsoft’s uninspiring outcome and Meta’s surprise tax loss,” he said, adding that the stock moves were mostly within expected volatility ranges, with Microsoft’s reaction relatively muted. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the latest earnings confirm that there is no sign of a slowdown in the AI capital spending boom. The firm noted that the combined capital expenditure of the three companies rose by $14 billion quarter-on-quarter, or more than 22%, maintaining the same pace as the previous quarter and up 88% from a year ago. Despite the mixed share price reactions, the overall message is clear — AI remains the centrepiece of Big Tech’s long-term strategy. While short-term costs are weighing on profitability, investors continue to bet that these massive infrastructure investments will yield significant payoffs in the years ahead.

Title: Meta’s stock slides on AI bubble fears, as Zuckerberg calls for increased spending

UPDATED 22:19 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc.’s plans to increase spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure made investors jittery today, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading, despite the social network posting solid earnings and revenue beats. In its third-quarter results, the company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $7.25 per share, crushing Wall Street’s targets. Analysts had projected earnings of just $6.69 per share. The company’s revenue also came in above expectations, rising 26% from a year earlier, to $51.24 billion. The Street had been looking for just $49.41 billion in sales. However, the company’s bottom line took a massive hit in the quarter, with net income coming to just $2.7 billion, down from a profit of $15.68 billion in the year-ago period. That’s because Meta was slapped with a substantial onetime tax charge of $15.93 billion that relates to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently implemented One Big Beautiful Bill Act. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the Act will ultimately be beneficial to the company, leading to a “significant reduction” in its federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) hailed what he said was a strong quarter for both the business and its community. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses,” he added. “If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Looking at the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $56 billion and $59 billion, with the midpoint of that range falling just shy of Wall Street’s target of $57.58 billion estimate. It wasn’t the guidance that got investors unduly worried, but rather the fact that Meta once again announced plans to increase its spending. Li told analysts the company is raising the low end of its spending forecast by $2 billion, and said the new forecast range is now between $116 billion and $118 billion, up from a range of $114 billion to $118 billion. In addition, the company also upped its fiscal 2025 capital expenditure guidance, saying this will now amount to between $70 billion and $72 billion, up from a previous range of $66 billion to $72 billion. In recent months, concerns have been growing among some critics that the extravagant spending by Meta and its big technology peers is fueling a bubble in the AI industry that may one day burst, with potentially devastating consequences for the stock market. The company has invested billions of dollars into AI, not only on the data center infrastructure it needs but also in acquiring talented developers, such as Scale AI Inc. founder Alexandr Wang, who now heads up the company’s Superintelligence Labs unit. On the call, Zuckerberg did his best to address these concerns, saying that he is seeing a “pattern” that shows Meta will likely need to invest in even more computing infrastructure than it initially believed it would need. That’s why the company has also signed massive, multibillion-dollar cloud computing contracts with the likes of Google Cloud, Oracle Corp. and CoreWeave Inc., he said. But he believes these investments will pay off handsomely for the company over time. “Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period,” he promised. Moreover, he expressed confidence that overspending wouldn’t necessarily be the disaster that many envisage. He said that if AI doesn’t grow as fast as he anticipates, the company can always repurpose its new infrastructure for other workloads, such as improving its core recommendation algorithms. He said there’s potential to do this “in a very profitable way.” Zacks Investment Research analyst Andrew Rocco told SiliconANGLE that the increased capex spend suggests that Meta ultimately believes AI will result in people spending more time using its applications, which will generate more advertising revenues from the company. He’s especially optimistic about the prospects of Instagram Reels, which is its highest-growing ad segment. Moreover, he believes most investors understand this. “I expect deep-pocketed institutional investors to defend the stock in the coming days at the $690 to $700 level,” Rocco said. During the quarter, Meta completed a massive overhaul of its AI organization, snatching up Wang and other high-profile talents and creating the Superintelligence Labs unit in the wake of the lukewarm reception of its open-source Llama 4 model in April. Last week, the company caused a surprise when it said it’s laying off about 600 workers from its AI teams, while leaving its top-level TBD Labs alone. Last month, the company debuted a new feature called Vibes in the Meta AI application, which delivers a feed of AI-generated videos, and it has had a promising start. Since Vibes was launched, Meta AI app downloads have increased by 56% to a total of just over 3.9 million. “Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,” Zuckerberg told analysts. AI may also make a difference to the fortunes of Meta’s Reality Labs business, which has been likened to a black hole or a money pit due to the staggering losses it posts quarter after quarter. In the last three months, it racked up a loss of just over $4.4 billion while generating just $470 million in sales. Moreover, Li said, Reality Labs’ revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from the same period last year. That’s because the company has not released a new virtual reality headset this year, mainly because retailers who purchased inventory of its existing model are waiting to shift that stock over the holiday season. “We’re still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we’ve introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,” Li said. She was referring to the company’s newly announced Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which launched last month with a $799 price tag. They’re the company’s first consumer-ready AI glasses to feature an integrated display in the lens. They also come with a wristband that enables users to navigate through that display using gesture controls. According to Zuckerberg, the product is sold out, and all demo slots for November have been fully booked up. “We’re going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,” he explained. Meta reported 3.54 billion daily active people across its family of applications in the quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s target of 3.5 billion. Total advertising sales came to $50.08 billion, also beating expectations. Analysts had been looking for $48.5 billion in ad revenue. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said the strong ad performance was the main factor behind Meta’s earnings and revenue beat. “Advertising momentum grew 26% in the quarter, benefitting from increased ad impressions, up 14%, and higher average pricing of around 10%,” he said. “Better pricing was key to the beat.” Despite today’s after-hours drop, Meta’s stock has still gained more than 28% in the year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index, which is up just over 17% in the same period.

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Excluding the charge, net income would have risen in the quarter as daily active users rose year over year Meta’s third-quarter net profit dropped by 83% due to a tax charge implemented as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tech giant generated $51 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 26% from last year, but the net profit plummeted to $2.7 billion due to the charge. Excluding the charge, net income would have been $18.64 billion, up 19% from a year ago. Meta noted in its earnings release that it expects a significant reduction in U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and in the future, but this quarter was significantly affected by a “one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.” Meta, like many other tech giants, has gone all-in on artificial intelligence, and is pouring billions of dollars into developing AI “superintelligence.” The company believes “superintelligence” represents a “paradigm shift” in how computing works and the kind of relationship it will have with its customers, and executives spent a significant chunk of the earnings conference call to discuss its potential. “We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in the earnings release. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Meta has a history of exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 2.4% on average. Last quarter the company had its best second quarter to date with revenue of $47.52 billion, outpacing estimates by 6%. The company reported growth in their daily active user base with 3.54 billion visiting one of its apps daily. Meta also noted that it employs 78,450 people as of Sept. 30, an increase of 8% year-over-year. The stock price rose 0.03% to $751.67 in after-hours trading. Here are the key results from Meta’s third quarter report: Revenue: Meta reported $51.24 billion in third quarter sales, up 26% annually, outpacing the $49 billion analysts had projected. Most of the company’s revenue came from advertising. Net income: The company reported $2.71 billion in net income, an 83% drop from the third quarter of 2024 because of tax charges. Excluding the charge, it would’ve been $18.64 billion. Daily active users: Meta’s daily active user base across its apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads increased 8% year-over-year to 3.54 billion users. Earnings Per Share: $7.25, which surpassed the $6.71 estimate EPS analysts projected. This figure is adjusted for the tax charge. Signed into law in July, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act prompted Meta to recognize a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal deferred tax assets. The company had to pay a one-time $15.9 billion charge. While significant, the bill is expected to lower Meta’s future U.S. federal tax payments. The company reported an effective tax rate of 87%. Under the assumption nothing changes in the tax landscape, Meta expects the fourth-quarter tax rate to be 12-15%. Across its family of apps, Meta saw an increase of 14% in ad impressions. On top of that, the average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year. The company expects fourth-quarter total revenue to be in the range of $56-59 billion. Meta expects the full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year. Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology – lost $4.43 billion in the third quarter. The previous quarter the company lost $4.53 billion on the effort. Meta said the anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to the introduction of Quest 3S in the fourth quarter of last year and the Quest headsets hitting the retail market during the third quarter of this year to prepare for the holiday season. The Meta CEO said Instagram has 3 billion monthly active users, and the company’s text-based platform Threads has 150 million daily actives users. Both Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li expressed excitement in Meta’s generative AI video platform Vibes. Li noted that users have generated over 20 billion images using Meta’s products since launching Vibes in September. The company has seen media generation in the app increase more than tenfold. Zuckerberg added that over a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis. Zuckerberg expressed continued interest in superintelligence, a level of AI that would match or surpass human-level understanding. Though the CEO did not have specific details on the lab’s advancement, he said they are “heads down developing our next generation of models and products” in order to be the leading frontier AI Lab. “Our approach of advancing open source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits,” he said. “Meta superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start. I think that we’ve already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry.” “The company that is the best at each of these capabilities will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that,” Zuckerberg added of Meta’s strategy in forwarding AI implementation. “I’m not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them, but what we’re trying to do is to not do some things that others have done. We’re really trying to build novel capabilities, and I’m keeping this high level.” The CEO was coy about the details of Meta’s AI advancements, only noting that they would eventually bolster its existing platforms and services while unlocking new business opportunities.

Title: Meta Earnings: How Will Its AI And Metaverse Investments Perform?

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $796.25/share and is currently trading near $746. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $6.61/share on $49.34 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $7.21/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78. In 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. In 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $28.29 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $30.19. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 27 which is around the same (1x) the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting strong and is building a new bullish base after recently hitting a fresh record high. Currently, the stock is trading around 6% below its all-time high which is bullish considering it was down double digits from its record high earlier this year. Near-term support is the 50 day moving average (DMA) line and then the 200 DMA line. The stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been previously featured as a leading stock on my stock market membership site: FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: The rise and fall of globalisation: why the world’s next financial meltdown could be much worse with the US on the sidelines

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.kfpkrfqkw Share article Print article This is the second in a two-part series. Read part one here. Globalisation has always had its critics – but until recently, they have come mainly from the left rather than the right. In the wake of the second world war, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalisation were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatising their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment – all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks. This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain’s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting: When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalisation in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers – while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies. Mass left-led demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this “battle of Seattle”, violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by then US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilisation of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalisation – with anti-capitalism “Occupy” protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. In the US, a further critique of globalisation centred on its domestic consequences for American workers – namely, job losses and lower pay – and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles who opposed giving any role to international organisations like the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target. Under Donald Trump’s second term as US president, these criticisms have been transformed into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies – with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump – despite all his grandstanding on the world stage – has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivalled no.1 currency, is drawing rapidly to a close. Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its leadership role in international economic institutions such as the WTO. Now, the strongest part of its economy, the hi-tech sector, is under intense pressure from China, whose economy is already bigger than the US’s by one key measure of GDP. Meanwhile, the majority of US citizens are facing stagnant incomes, higher prices and more insecure jobs. In previous centuries, when first France and then Great Britain reached the end of their eras of world domination, these transitions had painful impacts beyond their borders. This time, with the global economy more closely integrated than ever before and no single dominant power waiting in the wings to take over, the impacts could be felt even more widely – with very damaging, if not catastrophic, results. When it comes to taking over from the US as the world’s leading hegemonic power, the only viable candidates with big enough economies are the European Union and China. But there are strong reasons to doubt that either could take on this role – notwithstanding the fact that in 2022, then US president Joe Biden’s National Security Strategy called China: “The only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so.” At times Biden’s successor, President Trump, has sounded almost jealous of the control China’s leaders exert over their national economy, and the fact they do not face elections and limits on their terms in office. But a one-party, authoritarian political system which lacks legal checks and balances is a key reason China will find it hard to gain the cultural and political dominance among democratic nations that is part of achieving world no.1 status – despite the influence it already wields in large parts of Asia and Africa. China still faces big economic challenges too. While it is already the global leader in manufactured goods (rapidly moving into hi-tech products) and the world’s largest exporter, its economy is still very unbalanced – with a much smaller consumer sector, a weak property market, many inefficient state industries that are highly indebted, and a relatively small financial sector restricted by state ownership. Nor does China possess a global currency, despite its (limited) attempts to make the renminbi a truly international currency. The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. As I found on a reporting trip to Shanghai in 2007 to investigate the effects of globalisation, there are also enormous differences between China’s prosperous coastal megacities – whose main thoroughfares rival New York and Paris – and the relative poverty in the interior, especially in rural areas. But nearly two decades on from that visit, with the country’s growth rate slowing, many university-educated young people are also finding it hard to find well-paid jobs now. Meanwhile Europe – the only other contender to take the US’s place as global no.1 – is deeply politically divided, with smaller, weaker economies to the east and south far more sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, and increasingly divided on issues such as migration and the Ukraine war. The challenges of achieving broad policy agreement among all member states, and the problem of who can speak for Europe, make it unlikely that the EU as currently constituted could initiate and enforce a new global world order on its own. The EU’s financial system also lacks the heft of the US’s. Although it has a common currency (the euro) managed by the European Central Bank, its financial system is far more fragmented. Banks are regulated nationally, and each country issues its own government bonds (although a few eurobonds now exist). This makes it hard for the euro to replace the dollar as a store of value, and reduces the incentive for foreigners to hold euros as an alternative reserve currency. Meanwhile, any future prospects of a renewal of US global leadership look similarly unpromising. Trump’s policy of cutting taxes while increasing the size of the US government debt – which now stands at US$38 trillion, or 120% of GDP – threatens both the stability of the world economy and the ability of the US to finance this mind-boggling deficit. Tellingly, the Trump administration shows no interest in reviving, or even engaging with, many of the international financial institutions which America once dominated, and which helped shape the world economic order – as US trade representative Jamieson Greer expressed disdainfully in the New York Times recently: Our current, nameless global order, which is dominated by the WTO and is notionally designed to pursue economic efficiency and regulate the trade policies of its 166 member countries, is untenable and unsustainable. The US has paid for this system with the loss of industrial jobs and economic security, and the biggest winner has been China. While the US is not, so far, withdrawing from the IMF, the Trump administration has urged it to call out China for running such a large trade surplus, while abandoning its concern about climate change. Greer concluded that the US has “subordinated our country’s economic and national security imperatives to a lowest common denominator of global consensus”. To understand the potential dangers ahead, we must go back more than a century to the last time there was no global hegemon. By the time the first world war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28 1919, the international economic order had collapsed. Britain, world leader over the previous century, no longer possessed the economic, political or military clout to enforce its version of globalisation. The UK government, burdened by the huge debts it had taken out to finance the war effort, was forced to make major cuts in public spending. In 1931, it faced a sterling crisis: the pound had to be devalued as the UK exited from the gold standard for good, despite having yielded to the demands of international bankers to cut payments to the unemployed. This was a final sign that Britain had lost its dominant place in the world economic order. The 1930s were a time of deep political unease and unrest in Britain and many other countries. In 1936, unemployed workers from Jarrow, a town in north-east England with 70% unemployment after its shipyards closed, organised a non-political “hunger march” to London which became known as the Jarrow crusade. More than 200 men, dressed in their Sunday best, marched peacefully in step for over 200 miles, gaining great support along the way. Yet when they reached London, prime minister Stanley Baldwin ignored their petition – and the men were informed their dole money would be docked because they had been unavailable for work over the past fortnight. Europe was also facing a severe economic crisis. After Germany’s government refused to pay the reparations agreed in the 1919 Versailles treaty, saying they would bankrupt its economy, the French army occupied the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr and German workers went on strike, supported by their government. The ensuing struggle fuelled hyperinflation in Germany. By November 1923, it took 200,000 million marks to buy a loaf of bread, and the savings and pensions of the German middle class were wiped out. That month, Adolf Hitler made his first attempt to seize power in the failed “Beer hall putsch” in Munich. In contrast, across the Atlantic, the US was enjoying a period of postwar prosperity, with a booming stock market and explosive growth of new industries such as car manufacturing. But despite emerging as the world’s strongest economic power, having financed much of the Allied war effort, it was unwilling to grasp the reins of global economic leadership. The Republican US Congress, having blocked President Woodrow Wilson’s plan for a League of Nations, instead embraced isolationism and washed its hands of Europe’s problems. The US refused to cancel or even reduce the war debts owed it by the Allied nations, who eventually repudiated their debts. In retaliation, the US Congress banned all American banks from lending money to these so-called allies. Then, in 1929, the affluent American “jazz age” came to an abrupt halt with a stock market crash that wiped off half its value. The country’s largest manufacturer, Ford, closed its doors for a year and laid off all its workers. With a quarter of the nation unemployed, long lines for soup kitchens were seen in every city, while those who had been evicted camped out wherever they could – including in New York’s Central Park, renamed “Hooverville” after the hapless US president of that time, Herbert Hoover. In rural areas where the collapse in agricultural prices meant farmers could no longer make a living, armed farmers stopped food and milk trucks and destroyed their contents in a vain attempt to limit supply and raise prices. By March 1933, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the entire US banking system had ground to a standstill, with no one able to withdraw money from their bank account. With its focus on this devastating Great Depression, the US refused to get involved in attempts at international economic cooperation. With no notice, Roosevelt withdrew from the 1933 London Conference which had been called to stabilise the world’s currencies – sending a message denouncing “the old fetishes of the so-called international bankers”. With the US following the UK off the gold standard, the resulting currency wars exacerbated the crisis and further weakened European economies. As countries reverted to mercantilist policies of protectionism and trade wars, world trade shrank dramatically. The situation became even worse in central Europe, where the collapse of the huge Credit-Anstalt bank in Austria in 1931 reverberated around the region. In Germany, as mass unemployment soared, centrist parties were squeezed and armed riots broke out between communist and fascist supporters. When the Nazis came to power, they introduced a policy of autarky, cutting economic ties with the west to build up their military machine. The economic rivalries and antagonisms which weakened western economies paved the way for the rise of fascism in Germany. In some sense, Hitler – an admirer of the British empire – aspired to be the next hegemonic economic as well as military power, creating his own empire by conquering and ruthlessly exploiting the resources of the rest of Europe. Nearly a century later, there are some disturbing parallels with that interwar period. Like America after the first world war, Trump insists that countries the US has supported militarily now owe it money for this protection. He wants to encourage currency wars by devaluing the dollar, and raise protectionist barriers to protect domestic industry. The 1920s was also a time when the US sharply limited immigration on eugenic grounds, only allowing it from northern European countries which (the eugenicists argued) would not “pollute the white race”. Clearly, Trump does not view the lack of international cooperation that could amplify the damaging economic effects of a stock or bond market crash as a problem that should concern him. And in today’s unstable world, for all the US’s past failings as a global leader, that is a very worrying proposition. Once again, the rules of the international order are breaking down. While it is possible that Trump’s approach will not be fully adopted by his successor in the White House, the direction of travel in the US will almost certainly remain sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, with limited support for any worldwide economic rules or initiatives. We see similar scepticism about the benefits of globalisation emerging in other countries, amid the rise of rightwing populist parties in much of Europe and South America – many backed by Trump. Fuelling these parties’ support are growing concerns about income inequality, slow growth and immigration which are not being addressed by the current political system – and all of which would be exacerbated by the onset of a new global economic crisis. With the global economy and financial system far bigger than ever before, a new crisis could be even more severe than the one that occurred in 2008, when the failure of the banking system left the world teetering on the brink of collapse. The scale of this crisis was unprecedented, but key US and UK government officials moved boldly and swiftly. As a BBC reporter in Washington, I attended the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee hearing three days after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, paralysing the global financial system, to find out the administration’s response. I remember the stunned look on the face of the committee’s chairman, Barney Frank, when he asked US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson and US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke how much money they might need to stabilise the situation: “Let’s start with US$1 trillion,” Bernanke replied coolly. “But we have another US$2 trillion on our balance sheet if we need it.” Shortly afterwards, the US Congress approved a US$700 billion rescue package. While the global economy has still not fully recovered from this crisis, it could have been far worse – possibly as bad as the 1930s – without such intervention. Around the world, governments ended up pledging US$11 trillion to guarantee the solvency of their banking systems, with the UK government putting up a sum equivalent to the country’s entire yearly GDP. But it was not just governments. At the G20 summit in London in April 2009, a new US$1.1 trillion fund was set up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to advance money to countries that were getting into financial difficulty. The G20 also agreed to impose tougher regulatory standards for banks and other financial institutions that would apply globally, to replace the weak regulation of banks that had been one of the main causes of the crisis. As a reporter at this summit, I recall widespread excitement and optimism that the world was finally working together to tackle its global problems, with the host prime minister, Gordon Brown, briefly glowing in the limelight as organiser of that summit. Behind the scenes, the US Federal Reserve had also been working to contain the crisis by quietly passing on to the world’s other leading central banks nearly US$600 billion in “currency swaps” to ensure they had the dollars they needed to bail out their own banking systems. The Bank of England secretly lent UK banks £100 billion to ensure they didn’t collapse, although two of the four major banks, Royal Bank of Scotland (now NatWest) and Lloyds, ultimately had to be nationalised (to different extents) to keep the financial system stable. However, these rescue packages for banks, while much needed to stabilise the global economy, did not extend to many of the victims of the crash – such as the 12 million US households whose homes were now worth less than the mortgage they had taken out to pay for them, or the 40% of households who experienced financial distress during the 18 months after the crash. And the ramifications of the crisis were even greater for those living in developing countries. A few months after the 2008 financial crisis began, I travelled to Zambia, an African country totally dependent on copper exports for its foreign exchange. I visited the Luanshya copper mine near Ndola in the country’s copper belt. With demand for copper (used mainly in construction and car manufacturing) collapsing, all the copper mines had closed. Their workers, in one of the few well-paid jobs in Zambia, were forced to leave their comfortable company homes and return to sharing with their relatives in Lusaka without pay. Zambia’s government was forced to shut down its planned poverty reduction plan, which was to be funded by mining profits. The collapse in exports also damaged the Zambian currency, which dropped sharply. This hit the country’s poorest people hard as it raised the price of food, most of which was imported. I also visited a flower farm near Lusaka, where Dutch expats Angelique and Watze Elsinga had been growing roses for export for over a decade – employing more than 200 workers who were given housing and education. As the market for Valentine’s Day roses collapsed, their bankers, Barclays South Africa, suddenly ordered them to immediately repay all their loans, forcing them to sell their farm and dismiss their workers. Ultimately, it took a US$3.9 billion loan from the IMF and World Bank to stabilise Zambia’s economy. Should another global financial crisis hit, it is hard to see the Trump administration (and others that follow) being as sympathetic to the plight of developing countries, or allowing the Federal Reserve to lend major sums to foreign central banks – unless it is a country politically aligned with Trump, such as Argentina. Least likely of all is the idea of Trump working with other countries to develop a global trillion-dollar rescue package to help save the world economy. Rather, there is a real worry that reckless actions by the Trump administration – and weak global regulation of financial markets – could trigger the next global financial crisis. Economic historians agree that financial crises are endemic in the history of global capitalism, and they have been increasing in frequency since the “hyper-globalisation” of the 1970s. From Latin America’s debt crisis in the 1980s to the Asia currency crisis in the late 1990s and the US dotcom stock market collapse in the early 2000s, crises have regularly devastated economies and regions around the world. Today, the greatest risk is the collapse of the US Treasury bond market, which underpins the global financial system and is involved in 70% of global financial transactions by banks and other financial institutions. Around the world, these institutions have long regarded the US bond market, worth over $30 trillion, as a safe haven, because these “debt securities” are backed by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Increasingly, the unregulated “shadow banking system” – a sector now larger than regulated global banks – is deeply involved in the bond market. Non-bank financial institutions such as private equity, hedge funds, venture capital and pension funds are largely unregulated and, unlike banks, are not required to hold reserves. Bond market jitters are already unnerving global financial markets, which fear its unravelling could precipitate a banking crisis on the scale of 2008 – with highly leveraged transactions by these non-bank financial institutions leaving them exposed. Buyers of US bonds are also troubled by the Trump administration’s plan to raise the US deficit even higher to pay for tax cuts – with the national debt now forecast to rise to 134% of US GDP by 2035, up from 120% in 2025. Should this lead to a widespread refusal to buy more US bonds among jittery investors, their value would collapse and interest rates – both in the US and globally – would soar. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, recently warned that the situation has “worrying echoes of the 2008 financial crisis”, while the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, said her worries about the collapse of private credit markets sometimes keep her awake at night. A bad situation would grow even worse if problems in the bond market precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar. The world’s “anchor currency” would no longer be seen as a safe store of value – leading to more withdrawals of funds from the US Treasury bond market, where many foreign governments hold their reserves. A weaker dollar would also make imported goods more expensive for US consumers, while potentially boosting the country’s exports. This is precisely the course of action advocated by Stephen Miran, chair of the US president’s Council of Economic Advisors – who Trump appears to want to be the next head of the Federal Reserve. One example of what could happen if bond markets become destabilised occurred when the shortest-lived prime minister in UK history, Liz Truss, announced huge unfunded tax cuts in her 2022 budget, causing the value of UK gilts (the equivalent of US Treasury bonds) to plummet as interest rates spiked. Within days, the Bank of England was forced to put up an emergency £60 billion rescue fund to avoid major UK pension funds collapsing. In the case of a US bond market crash, however, there are growing fears that the US government would be unable – and unwilling – to step in to mitigate such damage. Just as worrying would be a crash of the US stock market – which, by historic standards, is currently vastly overvalued. Huge recent increases in the US stock market’s overall value have been driven almost entirely by the “magnificent seven” hi-tech companies, which alone make up a third of its total value. If their big bet on artificial intelligence is not as lucrative as they claim, or is overshadowed by the success of China’s AI systems, a sharp downturn, similar to the dotcom crash of 2000-02, could well occur. Read more: What 2,000 years of Chinese history reveals about today's AI-driven technology panic – and the future of inequality Jamie Dimon, head of the US’s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, has said he is “far more worried than other [experts]” about a serious market correction, which he warned could come in the next six months to two years. Big tech executives have been overoptimistic before. Reporting from Silicon Valley in 2001 as the dotcom bubble was bursting, I was struck by the unshakeable belief of internet startup CEOs that their share prices could only go up. Furthermore, their companies’ high stock valuations had allowed them to take over their competitors, thus limiting competition – just as companies such as Google and Meta (Facebook) have since used their highly valued shares to purchase key assets and potential rivals including YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and DeepMind. History suggests this is always bad for the economy in the long run. With the business and financial worlds now ever more closely linked, not only has the frequency of financial crises increased in the last half-century, each crisis has become more interconnected. The 2008 global financial crisis showed how dangerous this can be: a global banking crisis triggered stock market falls, collapses in the value of weak currencies, a debt crisis in developing countries – and ultimately, a global recession that has taken years to recover from. The IMF’s latest financial stability report summarised the situation in worrying terms, highlighting “elevated” stability risks as a result of “stretched asset valuations, growing pressure in sovereign bond markets, and the increasing role of non-bank financial institutions. Despite its deep liquidity, the global foreign exchange market remains vulnerable to macrofinancial uncertainty.” I believe we may be entering a new era of sustained financial chaos during which the seeds sown by the death of globalisation – and Trump’s response to it – finally shatter the world economic and political order established after the second world war. Trump’s high and erratically applied tariffs – aimed most strongly at China – have already made it difficult to reconfigure global supply chains. Even more worrying could be the struggle over the control of key strategic raw materials like the rare earth minerals needed for hi-tech industries, with China banning their export and the US threatening 100% tariffs in return (as well as hoping to take over Greenland, with its as-yet-untapped supply of some of these minerals). This conflict over rare earths, vital for the computer chips needed for AI, could also threaten the market value of high-flying tech stocks such as Nvidia, the first company to exceed US$4 trillion in value. The battle for control of critical raw materials could escalate. There is a danger that in some cases, trade wars might become real wars – just as they did in the former era of mercantilism. Many recent and current regional conflicts, from the first Iraq war aimed at the conquest of the oilfields of Kuwait, to the civil war in Sudan over control of the country’s goldmines, are rooted in economic conflicts. The history of globalisation over the past four centuries suggests that the presence of a global superpower – for all its negative sides – has brought a degree of economic stability in an uncertain world. In contrast, a key lesson of history is that a return to policies of mercantilism – with countries struggling to seize key natural resources for themselves and deny them to their rivals – is most likely a recipe for perpetual conflict. But this time around, in a world full of 10,000 nuclear weapons, miscalculations could be fatal if trust and certainty are undermined. The challenges ahead are immense – and the weakness of international institutions, the limited visions of most governments and the alienation of many of their citizens are not optimistic signs.

Title: Nvidia Becomes the First Company to Hit $5 Trillion Market Cap
URL: https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-becomes-the-first-company-to-hit-5-trillion-market-cap-2000678694
Time Published: 2025-10-29T14:46:21Z

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Nvidia just became the first company in the world to be worth $5 trillion, just four months after it made history by hitting a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company owed that last bump to a series of high-profile announcements that CEO Jensen Huang made at the first Washington D.C. edition of its conference, GTC, and the raging hype cycle around companies working in AI. On Tuesday, Huang announced that Nvidia would partner with: The company also delighted investors when Huang announced that Nvidia is expecting half a trillion dollars in orders for its Blackwell and Rubin chips through next year. Also helping Nvidia’s case is its close ties to the Trump administration, which was on full display at the GTC in D.C. Huang spent a good chunk of his time praising the administration and the President personally, saying that “no one works harder” than him. Huang also told the crowd that he is jetting off to South Korea to meet the President on his Asia diplomacy tour. Trump is supposed to have a key trade meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea, and the outcome of that meeting is likely to be of great concern to Nvidia. Perhaps the only thing that has been weighing on Nvidia in the market the past few months has been the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Nvidia has been caught in the crossfire of that dispute many times. The tech giant is banking on a trade deal that would allow it to resume selling its chips in China, in what was once one of its strongest markets. Gaining Trump’s confidence is key to doing that. The market value of the biggest names in AI is off the charts, and Nvidia leads the charge. There are only three companies in the world that are worth more than $4 trillion, and they are all tech giants buoyed by the AI trade. Microsoft was the second company to cross the benchmark after Nvidia in July, and Apple became the third yesterday. This meteoric rise in value only makes fears of an AI bubble worse. Not only are most experts raising concerns that AI companies are overvalued, but their outsized influence on the market and the U.S. economy makes any downturn correction dangerous. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that “equity market valuations appear stretched” for AI companies, stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta) was at its highest concentration in 50 years. The U.S. market is banking on an unprecedented boom in AI demand, and Nvidia is considered the darling of the AI trade. They are in charge of supplying the chips that are at the core of this infrastructure build-out. But if demand does not shape up as expected or if the build-out runs into any material bottlenecks, like supply chain problems or a lack of energy and resources, then all this valuation (and everything attached to it) is at risk of coming crashing down.

Title: Watch this warning sign for when it's time to 'run for the hills' and sell AI stocks

BCA Research said it was looking for one warning sign in particular when it comes to the AI boom, which has sent tech stocks into stratospheric territory as companies pour billions into AI-related investments. According to Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the research firm, it could be time for investors to get out when AI sees a "metaverse moment" — a scenario in which a large AI firm announces "even more capex" and sees its stock price drop, he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "If that were to happen, it would be time to run for the hills," Berezin said. "Until then, we are content to maintain only a slightly below-benchmark allocation to stocks on a 12-month horizon," he added. The metaverse embodied the market zeitgeist and drew billions in investment several years ago. The concept eventually faded out of popularity, causing firms like Meta to eventually report billions in losses. Some observers have drawn parallels to the AI craze, which has seen large tech firms pouring buckets into chips and data centers while monetization plans remain unclear. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four companies at the center of the AI trade — could spend as much as $320 billion on capex primarily related to AI infrastructure this year, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Tech stocks have already flashed several warning signs recently, Berezin said. For one, the free cash flow of the so-called hyperscalers — large tech companies spending big on AI — has fallen in recent months, a possible sign that balance sheets at those companies are weaker. That was similar to what happened to telecom stocks prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Berezin said. Second, speculative stocks that have been buoyed by the AI trade have sold off in recent weeks. That's another worrying sign for the AI trade, Berezin added, pointing to the recent decline in quantum computing, rare earth, and nuclear energy stocks. Talk of a stock market bubble has grown on Wall Street as investors as investors take stock of enormous AI-fueled gains in recent years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is up 135% over the last five years. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven companies at the heart of the AI trade, is up 172% since its inception. Jump to

Title: Federal Reserve monetary policy statement today: 25 bps rate cut a done deal? what time will Jerome Powell announce the Fed decision and how will the U.S. stock market react?

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

The tech giant's stock was up around 4.4% to almost $210 in the opening minutes of trading, giving it a valuation of roughly $5.1 trillion. The historic valuation milestone was reached after CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday that the company expects $500 billion in AI chip orders over the next four years and plans to build seven AI supercomputers for the US Department of Energy. Nvidia's upward move was also bolstered by President Donald Trump saying in a Wednesday press conference in South Korea that he could discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a meeting on Thursday. Nvidia also gained after a Tuesday announcement that it would invest $1 billion in Nokia to develop 6G technology. That news pushed the Finnish telecommunications' stock up to its highest level in almost a decade. The chip firm's stock has risen more than 50% so far in 2025 and has climbed a staggering 1,500% in the past five years. Nvidia's arrival at a $5 trillion valuation comes just a day after Apple hit a $4 trillion market capitalization, joining Microsoft and Nvidia in the exclusive club. Apple hit $4 trillion for the first time as the company's rally, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales, continued. Apple's share price was virtually unchanged at $269.68 at the open on Wednesday. "The Q3 earnings season will reach its apex this week with key reports due from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta on Wednesday as well as Apple and Amazon on Thursday," Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Monday. "The five biggest companies in the world after Nvidia now make up $15tn in total market capitalization or 25% of the S&P 500." Jump to

Title: Analysis:Tech spending plans will test stock market's AI trade

Business NEW YORK :Spending updates this week from U.S. megacap companies that are investing massively in artificial intelligence could jolt the AI trade that has been a primary driver of the record-breaking U.S. stocks rally. Capital spending is a crucial component of the AI trade that has propelled equities following the launch of AI assistant ChatGPT in November 2022. With the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17 per cent year-to-date and 90 per cent since the bull market began just over three years ago, investors are on guard for any weakness while wary of parallels with the dot-com market bubble 25 years ago. The rally has been led by a select group, including chipmaker Nvidia, which has symbolized the enthusiasm with its market-leading AI chips and mammoth share-price gains that have made it the world's largest company by market value, on the cusp of an unprecedented $5 trillion. Investment by the biggest companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, serves to build out the infrastructure that supports the burgeoning industry while signaling confidence in the theme, investors said.

Title: The Ultimate 100 Profitable Niches For Affiliate Marketing To Monetize In 2026 - NowG.net
URL: https://www.nowg.net/top-profitable-niches-for-affiliate-marketing/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T10:00:09Z
Full Content:
Last Updated on October 29, 2025 by Caesar Fikson Profitable niches for affiliate marketing in 2026 reward operators and seasoned affiliates who treat content like a product and funnels like software. We at NowG mapped the niches where budgets are growing, payouts stay sane, and buyer intent is measurable—especially across iGaming, fintech/crypto, B2B SaaS, and high-velocity consumer tech. You’ll see exactly why a niche pays, who to promote, and how to position it so your EPC doesn’t vanish after week two. Quick lens: we prioritize niches with rising TAM, resilient commissions, clean cookies/server-to-server tracking, and strong second-order revenue (upsell, retention, or LTV-backed CPL/CPA). We’re publishing the first 50 niches here; if you want Part 2 (51–100), say the word and we’ll roll it out the same way. 💡 Pro tip: Structure pages as “jobs to be done,” not encyclopedia entries: Choose A vs B → Set up → First win → Level up. Your conversion lift will be… not subtle. Table of Contents For gaming-savvy readers, these are the engines of high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue. We favor regulated brands and tools that make bettors/casino players smarter and stickier. B2B payouts are steadier and upgrades extend LTV. Perfect for comparison pages, ROI calculators, and “from template to result” tutorials. Growth persists where outcomes are trackable (weight, HRV, sleep). Pair programs with responsible, evidence-led content and clear disclaimers. Have you considered the downstream impact of stacking niches that naturally cross-sell? That’s where the margin lives. Wallet → exchange → tax software. Sportsbook → odds tool → bankroll tracker. Hosting → email → analytics. We’ve watched this triple ARPU without adding a single new traffic source. 💡 Pro tip: Build “starter bundles” with two-step CTAs (e.g., “Get the wallet → set up the exchange”). Bundle bonuses beat single-program coupons in both conversion and retention. Picture an affiliate team churning out single-product reviews. Traffic looks fine; EPC doesn’t. We at NowG regroup the site into five stacks: Crypto Onboarding, iGaming Toolkit, Creator Stack, Home Security, and Sleep & Recovery. Each stack has one “choose” page, one “set up” page, and one “first win” page. We rewrite CTAs for sequences, wire basic webhooks into a sheet, and measure mission completion instead of raw clicks. Thirty days later: fewer pages, more revenue—session depth +17%, second-conversion +22%, refunds lower. The products didn’t change. The architecture did. Try NowG’s free tools to map your stacks, score offers, and sanity-check time-to-first-conversion before you scale spend. Profitable niches for affiliate marketing keep the lights on when algorithms wobble. We at NowG finished mapping the second half of the list—fifty more niches where commissions are sane, intent is measurable, and the onramp to revenue is short. As before, you’ll get why each niche pays, the best-fit affiliate programs to consider (examples), and the winning angle that turns clicks into money. Lens unchanged: rising budgets, recurring or LTV-backed payouts, clean data access, and obvious cross-sells. Treat these as modules—build stacks and your ARPU compounds. 💡 Pro tip: Pair travel with finance stacks (cards, insurance, lounge access). One “How to build a points-friendly itinerary” guide can monetize three programs instead of one. Have you considered the downstream impact of adding a sustainability pillar to an existing home niche? Conversions rise when you couple cost savings with impact—two reasons to click, not one. 💡 Pro tip: Beauty and pet niches thrive on before/after and progress artifacts. Build a simple “progress log” printable and your retention will quietly climb. Frustrating when carts are full and conversions stall? In home/outdoor, onboarding content beats price cuts. Show the first weekend with the product and buyers stop procrastinating. 💡 Pro tip: Services convert on certainty. Publish response-time SLAs, pricing ranges, and “what happens after you click” flows. Your lead quality will jump. Don’t spin up 50 new categories. Build stacks around intent: Travel Stack, Green Home Stack, Pets Stack, Home/DIY Stack, and Career Stack. Each gets a “choose” page (A vs B), a “set up” page (first week), and a “first win” page (proof of outcome). Ship those three and your site becomes a product, not an encyclopedia. Here’s the bottom line: markets shift; intent doesn’t. If your pages move people from interest → action → result, the commission model barely matters—CPA, hybrid, rev share all work when the user gets a win fast. Try NowG’s free tools to map stacks, model commissions, and benchmark event latency before you scale traffic. Pick niches that cross-sell naturally with what you already rank for. Then prioritize the ones with recurring or LTV-backed payouts and vendors that expose hourly stats or webhooks. Speed to first win beats volume. One decision page (A vs B), one setup guide (first week), and one first-win tutorial per stack. Add a simple calculator or checklist to each. That trio outperforms 10 generic reviews. Limit yourself to stacks, not categories. Publish only pages that move users along the job-to-be-done path—everything else is backlog until the stack monetizes. Most are global with GEO-tuned providers. For leadgen (HVAC, pools, legal), build city/state landing pages and route leads to the right partner. Time-to-first-conversion, second-conversion rate (cross-sell), refund/chargeback rate, and 30/60/90-day EPC. If TTFX falls and 2nd-conversion rises, keep investing. Use iGaming for high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue (pair with odds tools and payment rails). Use finance to stabilize cashflow (cards, wallets, tax). They complement each other when sequenced well. We prioritized rising budgets, resilient commissions, and programs with solid data access (hourly stats or webhooks). We also weighted niches that cross-sell well—stacking raises ARPU without new traffic. Do both. Start with one niche you can own, then expand into adjacent products to create a stack (e.g., wallet → exchange → tax). Stacks compound LTV. Decision pages (A vs B), setup guides, and first-win tutorials. Add calculators and checklists to move users from interest to action quickly. Yes, but shadow-model hybrid for 6–8 weeks to reveal true LTV by GEO and to avoid overpaying for bonus hunters.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. NZME's chief executive Michael Boggs has upgraded its financial forecasts and says revenue is better than expected. Photo / Michael Craig The New Zealand sharemarket rose slightly today after a strong lead-in from the US markets. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.05% or 6.553 points at 13,409.21 after 30.7 million shares worth $123 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.07%, closing at 7676.73 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,764.34 after rising 0.19%. There were 72 gainers on the main board and 59 decliners. Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said the market was treading water today. “The index did follow in kind with US markets hitting record highs. “The latter part of our session we came back somewhat,” Sullivan said. “Looking ahead we’ve got a big couple of days for earnings in the US, as well as the Fed, so that’s probably going to be the main macro story for the markets.” Five companies from the “Magnificent Seven” will report over the next day and a half, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. On the NZ sharemarket, NZME upgraded its financial forecasts and said its revenue was likely to be better than expected. The media company told the NZX this morning it expected operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for 2025 to be between $59m and $62m. That was up on earlier guidance of between $57m and $59m. “NZME is heavily reliant on ad spend and has done a bit of cost-cutting as well. There’s some positive momentum into FY26 for them, midpoint of their upgrade at 12% year on year,” Sullivan said. NZME’s share price rallied 6.67% or 7c to $1.12 after 900,674 shares changed hands on turnover worth $1m. Elsewhere, market minnow New Talisman Gold Mines’ share price rallied by 16.98% to $0.06 after the firm announced it had signed an agreement for the offtake of gold concentrate. However, the regulator swiftly applied a trading halt to the company after the update. “They said their announcement wasn’t price-sensitive, but their stock went up 17%. They said they were freezing it and were going to have a closer look at it. If the market thinks it’s price-sensitive, it probably should have been [treated as such].” Other movers today included Vista Group, which fell 3.91% or 11c to $2.70; A2 Milk, which rose 1.90% or 20c to $10.70; and Contact Energy, which fell 0.63% or 6c to $9.40. Sullivan said the lead-in from the US was interesting, particularly for the fact that it featured the widest ever divergence of companies on the S&P 500 in a positive day. “There were 102 that were positive, and 398 that were negative, and yet the market closed up. That’s the widest it’s ever been. Nvidia now makes up 8% of the S&P 500, the largest since General Motors in the 1970s. “Now when Nvidia moves, so does the market.” Wall Street stocks rose to fresh records again on Tuesday local time as a jump in artificial intelligence player Nvidia’s shares added to bullishness over easing trade tensions and market-friendly central bank policy. All three major US indices climbed to records for the third straight session, with Nvidia piling on about 5% as the chipmaker announced new ventures and chief executive Jensen Huang headlined a company event in Washington. Donald Trump is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea – and rosy comments by the US President have fuelled optimism that the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, can strike a deal to ease their trade war. – Additional reporting AFP Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.
