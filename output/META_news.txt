04 September 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Khabarhub brings you a glimpse of major developments of the day in Nepal, including politics, business/economy, sports, entertainment, and more. Nepal directs ISPs to block 26 unregistered social media platforms The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has instructed the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to direct Internet service providers (ISPs) to block 26 social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, including Facebook. NTA Executive Director Min Prasad Aryal confirmed that ISPs have already received instructions to implement the ban. The decision follows the government’s directive that all social media platforms must complete registration under the Social Media Use Directive, within the timeframe set by the cabinet. These are the apps govt is blocking for not registering The government is enforcing its decision to block all social media platforms that have not completed official registration, effective immediately. This move follows a Supreme Court order and a recent ministerial meeting led by Communications Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung. Currently, only five platforms have completed registration and are allowed to operate in Nepal. These include TikTok, Viber, Nimbuzz, WeTalk, and Opolive. Platforms still in the process of registration, such as Telegram and Global Link, are temporarily permitted to operate. Meta reaches out to government over listing; Hamro Patro submits application Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reached out to the government of Nepal regarding the mandatory listing of social media platforms. According to Information Ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur, Meta representatives contacted the ministry’s secretariat to inquire about the required procedures and documents for listing. Seven provisions behind Nepal’s social media ban The government has said it will start blocking social media platforms that have not completed official registration, citing seven specific provisions under the Social Media Use Directive. The move follows a Supreme Court order requiring platforms to register before operating in Nepal. The government had issued a seven-day deadline starting August 28 for platforms to complete registration, but foreign-based operators failed to comply. With the deadline expired, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in consultation with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, initiated the ban. Leaders criticize government’s decision to block social media The government’s decision to block 26 social media platforms, including unregistered Facebook, has drawn sharp criticism from political leaders. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa called the move “a step in the wrong direction.” He said the Supreme Court had directed the government to make laws for regulation, not impose blanket bans. “The government has taken a reverse course. This must be reconsidered,” he said. Thapa added that social media is vital for freedom of expression, public debate, and government accountability. Maoist Centre to launch protests against government after Dashain-Tihar The main opposition, CPN (Maoist Centre), has decided to initiate protests against the government after the Dashain and Tihar festivals. Spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota said the office-bearers’ meeting held at the party headquarters in Parisdanda on Thursday concluded that corruption is on the rise and governance has weakened, prompting the need for protest. He added that the party would use street demonstrations to raise public awareness about democratic republican socialism and the socialist-oriented system envisioned in the constitution. PM Oli’s India visit uncertain, says Indian media Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is reportedly unlikely to visit India, according to an Indian news outlet. The Print Online cited sources suggesting that Oli’s planned visit on September 15 may not take place. The report comes shortly after a brief meeting between PM Modi and PM Oli on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this week. FNJ protests government decision to block social media The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has opposed the government’s decision to shut down unregistered social media platforms. In a statement issued on Thursday, FNJ General Secretary Ram Prasad Dahal said the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology’s decision to restrict unlisted platforms would curtail press freedom and freedom of expression. Ram Hari Khatiwada files candidacy for chair of Parliamentary Hearing Committee Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada has filed his candidacy for the post of chairperson of the Parliamentary Hearing Committee. He registered his nomination on Thursday following his party’s recommendation. Karn Thapa registers dissent ahead of UML’s statute convention CPN-UML Standing Committee member Karn Bahadur Thapa has officially registered his dissenting opinion at the party’s central office ahead of the second statute convention, set to begin on Friday. “I am at the party’s central office to formally register my dissent,” Thapa said on Thursday. “Once registered, I will make my dissent public. This is meant to contribute to internal party debate.” Parliamentary committee expresses dissatisfaction over new parliament building construction A parliamentary committee has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of construction work on the new Parliament building, which is still under construction. On Thursday, the Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Implementation of Directive Principles, Policies, and Responsibilities of the State, under the Federal Parliament, carried out a surprise inspection of the project. The committee remarked that the construction progress was far behind schedule. Embossed number plates essential for Digital Nepal: Transport Nepal Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal has emphasized that embossed number plates on vehicles are necessary to advance the government’s Digital Nepal initiative. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Minister Dahal explained that agreements for installing embossed plates had been signed three times in the past, and failing to implement them would require the government to pay Rs 3 billion to manufacturers without receiving any production. He clarified that the current government was merely implementing previous agreements. NEPSE dips by 6.55 points The Nepal stock market slipped by 6.55 points on Thursday, with the NEPSE index closing at 2,719.77. Before the weighted average calculation, the market was down by less than one point, but it fell by six points after the official tally. Trading volume increased compared to the previous day, reaching Rs 5.14 billion, up from Rs 4.72 billion. Among listed companies, 85 saw their share prices rise, 165 declined, and one remained unchanged. India enforces new India clarifies entry rules for Nepalis as new Immigration Act comes into effectimmigration rules The Government of India has introduced new immigration regulations under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, effective from September 1, according to the Times of India. The Act grants expanded powers to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), with the aim of curbing fraud, assisting state authorities in deporting illegal immigrants, and establishing a centralized immigration database. Inactive social media platforms to be reactivated once registered: Communication Ministry The government has decided to deactivate social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Thursday. The ministry stated that the move follows a Supreme Court order requiring both domestic and foreign online and social media platforms to undergo mandatory registration before operation in Nepal. Bhandari’s membership row is not an internal party dispute: Shankar Pokharel CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel has said that the issue of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s party membership should not be viewed as an internal dispute within UML but rather as a clash between her aspiration to reclaim membership and the party’s institutional decision. Speaking ahead of the second statute convention, which begins tomorrow in Godavari, Pokharel said the matter has been amplified outside the party even though it is essentially about setting a new precedent. Thapa cleared by EC to contest Rupandehi-3 by-election The candidacy of Dr. Lekh Jung Thapa, fielded by the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) for the upcoming Rupandehi-3 by-election, has sparked a wave of debate on social media. The discussion emerged after social media users cited a provision mentioned in a press release issued by Election Commission spokesperson and Joint Secretary Nita Pokharel Aryal on July 20. The provision states that individuals whose names remain on the closed list of proportional representation (PR) candidates from the 2022 federal and provincial elections cannot contest in upcoming polls. Nepali garment industries creating thousands of jobs: Minister Bhandari Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari has said that Nepal’s garment industries are creating employment opportunities for thousands of people while contributing significantly to the country’s economic development. Speaking at the inauguration of the 30th Annual General Assembly of the Nepal Garment Association on Wednesday, Minister Bhandari noted that the sector has played a vital role in generating jobs and earning foreign currency for the nation. RSP’s public affairs secretary Badan Bhandari attacked in Kathmandu Badan Bhandari, Secretary of the Public Affairs Department of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was attacked late last night in Pragati Chowk, Kapan, according to party officials. RSP Chair Rabi Lamichhane’s aide Pramod Nyaupane said three assailants on a motorcycle with its number plate concealed carried out the attack. Two of them struck Bhandari with iron rods, while the third was carrying a khukuri. Gold and silver prices unchanged The price of gold has remained unchanged on Thursday. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, the price of gold is Rs 207,900 per tola. RPP demands PM Oli’s clarification on reported agreement with China’s GSI The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has demanded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli clarify reports that Nepal has agreed to join China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). Speaking during the zero hour of the House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, RPP General Secretary Dr. Dhawal Shumsher Rana sought an explanation from the Prime Minister on behalf of his party. Indra Jatra commences in Kathmandu The Indra Jatra festival has begun in Kathmandu Valley today. Celebrated to worship Indra, the god of rain and cooperation, the festival is also known as Yenya Punhi among the Newar community. The festivities kicked off at Hanuman Dhoka with the erection of the Indra Dhwaja pole at 10:31 am. The eight-day celebration includes traditional dances, chariot processions, and rituals honoring various deities. Civil Service Bill to be tabled in House of Representatives The Federal Civil Service Bill is set to be tabled in the House of Representatives. During Thursday’s session, House Secretary Hark Raj Rai is scheduled to present the bill along with the message received from the National Assembly.

Title: 20VC + SaaStr is Back With Canva Founder Cliff Obrecht: Anthropic’s $13B Round, OpenAI’s $1.1B Statsig Acquisition & Why Public SaaS Is Back From The Dead

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale We’re back on 20VC+SaaStr, and its a great one as Canva Co-Founder and COO Cliff Obrecht joins Harry, Rory and Jason for a deep dive into this week’s biggest venture deals, AI infrastructure spending, and the return of public SaaS valuations. And why Canva won’t direct list. Cliff Obrecht (Canva COO): “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate. We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” Jason Lemkin (SaaStr): “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025 — you kind of failed as a founder because you have no excuse. You had 18 months.” Rory O’Driscoll (Scale Venture Partners): “Even if Anthropic goes from $9B ARR to $30B (3x growth down from 10x), that’s 8x next year’s revenues. High absolute number? Absolutely. Does it make sense if the growth persists? It’s not crazy.” Harry Stebbings (20VC): “Most VCs should have had Anthropic’s trajectory in their model 47 days ago. These companies are out-accelerating plan, but you’re always valuing future growth.” Anthropic’s latest funding round grabbed headlines not just for its size — $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money valuation — but for what the math reveals about AI company valuations when you dig deeper. “I went into the analysis expecting to say ‘aren’t those guys so silly paying so much?'” admits Rory O’Driscoll. “But when you look at the numbers, maybe those guys are being quite smart.” The trajectory is staggering: from $100 million two years ago to a $1 billion run rate at the start of this year, now approaching $8-9 billion by year-end. If accurate, this represents roughly 9x revenue growth in a single year. O’Driscoll’s forward-looking analysis reveals why investors were fighting to get in: “Even if they decelerate from 10x to 3x growth next year — going from $9B to $30B ARR — the average revenue would be around $20B. That’s 8x next year’s revenues if the growth persists.” The round was massively oversubscribed, with demand reportedly 5-10x the amount raised. For growth-stage investors, sitting out seemed impossible. “If you’re a growth stage investor, it’s hard to imagine a world where you say ‘well, we’re growth stage investors but the two largest market cap companies in the last 3-5 years are the two LLM models and we don’t have a piece of that,'” notes O’Driscoll. On the same day, OpenAI announced its acquisition of Statsig for $1.1 billion in stock — exactly matching the company’s last funding round valuation from Iconic Ventures. With Statsig generating $75 million ARR, the deal represents roughly 15x revenue multiple. The acquisition makes strategic sense beyond the numbers. Statsig’s CEO now ranks as #3 at OpenAI, and with Figma’s CEO joining OpenAI’s leadership, the company is assembling serious product talent. “The fact that it was exactly the price of the last round shows this was something that everyone wanted to roll into,” observes O’Driscoll. For Iconic, which led Anthropic’s previous round and was blocked from OpenAI’s direct investment, this provided a backdoor into the OpenAI ecosystem. Public SaaS companies delivered a surprise comeback this quarter, with Snowflake leading the charge with a 45% stock jump after reporting 24% year-over-year growth — a significant reacceleration from previous quarters. “It’s the Mark Twain reports of my debt were greatly exaggerated,” quips Rory. “Well, it turns out reports of the death of SaaS and software were greatly exaggerated.” The winners weren’t universal — MongoDB, Box, Elastic, Okta, and Zoom all posted strong results, while others like Salesforce haven’t yet seen the AI benefit flow through to revenue. “Some folks, about half of the public B2B leaders, are finally getting an AI tailwind,” says Lemkin. “Box should be crushing it because every time I spin up a new AI app, I need like two or three databases.” The market reaction reveals how beaten down expectations had become. When companies like Snowflake delivered even modest beats against lowered expectations, investors responded dramatically. Jensen Huang’s prediction of $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next five years sparked intense debate about whether such capex levels can generate sufficient returns. “Look at $4 trillion — you want a 20% return on equity, you’ve got to be generating $800 billion of profit,” calculates O’Driscoll. “That’s a lot of profit when Facebook and Meta combined make a couple hundred billion a year. You’ve got to believe you’re going to create another four Microsofts, another four Facebooks to justify that kind of spend.” The discussion revealed how AI costs are already impacting SaaS margins. Notion famously went from 90% to 80% gross margins, effectively paying a 10% “GPU tax” on their revenue. Canva’s Obrecht confirmed similar impacts: “100% yes, it already is [10% of revenue]. If you look at Lovable, their pass-through to Anthropic or model providers will be way more than 10%.” However, Obrecht expects optimization over time: “We’re betting on distilling these models down, understanding user queries and where I need the frontier model versus where I can deploy the model that’s on-device or self-hosted. Companies will get better at picking the right model for the right job.” Obrecht provided rare insights into Canva’s current trajectory and IPO preparations. The company will close the year “very close if not at $4 billion” in revenue, growing at nearly 40% and reaccelerating. “We have a lot of long-term partners and you want to pay loyalty to people that have supported you along the way, but we’re also thinking through what an IPO looks like,” Obrecht explained about their current secondary round approach. With over a billion in cash and eight years of profitability, Canva doesn’t need primary capital. The challenge became managing a supply-demand imbalance when employees wanted to sell after seeing Figma’s public debut. On timing, Obrecht noted: “We’re gearing up to be an IPO ready company. When we actually go out is another question, but we want to be ready.” The company faces the classic late-stage private company dilemma. “What is the real difference?” asks Obrecht about staying private versus going public. “As a late stage private company with all the big institutions already invested and continuing to do so, our reporting obligations and expectations to beat and raise are pretty much the same.” Obrecht was candid about the limitations of private market liquidity solutions: “There’s availability to capital which we have access to. I think it’s probably liquidity and there are restrictions particularly around employee liquidity and what you can do in the US and whatnot around that piece.” The 13-year-old company recognizes the fairness issue: “We’re 13 years old as a company. Our employees should have liquidity. They’ve created all this value. How can we make it easy for them to access that wealth that’s built up?” But secondary markets aren’t a perfect substitute for public liquidity: “While secondaries, annual secondaries are a mechanism for that, it’s pretty janky and particularly in some jurisdictions, it’s downright impossible.” This creates the awkward dynamic where employees need permission from their employer to access liquidity they’ve earned through years of value creation. “Having to get permission from your employer to get liquidity as a secondary after 13 years — it’s better than no liquidity but it’s a little bit serf-like,” notes one participant. “When you’re public you can make your own choices.” Canva’s AI integration offers a window into how established SaaS companies are navigating the transition. “AI is just accelerating [our mission] massively, making it quicker, faster, and better for customers to achieve their goals,” says Obrecht. The company is moving to a unified credit model for AI features, with free users getting limited credits, premium subscribers getting more, and heavy users paying usage-based pricing beyond certain thresholds. “We’ve got 240 million users. We’re about to launch in October a whole slew of new AI products deeply integrating it into every part of the workflow. We need to seriously run the math on if 20%, 50%, 80% of our users use this 10 times a month — the costs can look pretty big and eat into margins very significantly.” The conversation revealed fascinating insights about venture capital psychology around “the ones that got away.” Multiple participants shared examples of passing on companies early, then struggling to invest at higher valuations later. “Many of my most successful deals I’ve passed on prior,” admits O’Driscoll. “When you see the company say they’ll do A, B, and C, you pass because you don’t believe they’ll do A, B, and C, and then they do A, B, and even C prime — you have what you need to know.” The key insight: “The difference in information content between two data points over time, both of which are positive, and one data point where you have no calibration is almost infinite.” Obrecht observed this pattern with Canva investors: “The best investors that have done best out of Canva were early stage funds, but they realized ‘Holy shit, we’re onto something here.’ So they raised SPVs or additional vehicles to move further up the value chain, going later and later stage and compounded their position.” 1. AI Valuations Aren’t As Crazy As They Look Forward revenue multiples for companies like Anthropic become reasonable when you factor in sustained hypergrowth trajectories. 2. Public SaaS Is Back, But Selectively. Companies with distribution advantages and AI integration are seeing real reacceleration (Snowflake, Datadog, Box, Okta, GitLab even Zoom), while others remain stuck. 3. The 10% GPU Tax Is Real SaaS companies are already spending 10%+ of revenue on AI inference, but optimization will bring costs down over time. 4. Private-to-Public Arbitrage Exists Again Public markets are now valuing companies higher than late-stage private markets in many cases. 5. Don’t Let Pride Stop Follow-On Investments The biggest VC returns often come from doubling down on companies you initially passed on after seeing execution. “If Zuck’s not feeling great about his AI strategy, he can cry into his $200 billion and get over it on his own, right? Take it up with a therapist.” — Rory O’Driscoll on Zuck’s Meta challenges “We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” — Cliff Obrecht on Canva’s financial position “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate.” — Cliff Obrecht on market volatility vs execution “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025.” — Jason Lemkin on AI tailwinds for established SaaS companies “It’s a bit embarrassing as an early stage investor to buy Revolut off Goldman Sachs. That’s when you really fuck up as an early stage investor.” — Harry Stebbings on VC regret psychology Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

US stocks bounced back on Thursday as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rebounded after days of losses, lifted by weaker-than-expected jobs data that fueled fresh hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The move came as investors also tracked Salesforce’s steep drop, American Eagle’s surprise rally, and Stephen Miran’s Fed confirmation hearing, keeping both Wall Street and Washington in sharp focus.

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest September 25, 2025 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review September 25, 2025 issue Illustration by George Wylesol Illustration by George Wylesol Submit a letter: Email us letters@nybooks.com Reviewed: The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the Future of the West Last year, according to a recent report in The New York Times, Alexander Karp received a total of $6.8 billion for his services as CEO of the data analytics software company Palantir Technologies. This “compensation actually paid”—a metric that takes into account not just salary but also the amount by which stock holdings increase—made Karp, by a large margin, the highest-paid CEO in the United States. For anyone paying attention to Palantir’s recent fortunes, this was no great surprise. The stock value of the company—whose revenue comes largely from government contracts for data surveillance and the military application of artificial intelligence—is, one might say, negatively indexed to the peace and freedom of humanity. Over the past year the company’s stock has increased in value by a factor of almost six. At the time of writing Palantir was worth $375 billion, making it the twenty-second most valuable company in the S&P 500—just ahead of Coca-Cola and behind Bank of America. “Bad times,” as Karp put it in a recent CNBC appearance, “are incredibly good for Palantir.” And the times, of course, have been incredibly bad. Russia’s long and brutal war of imperial aggression in Ukraine. Israel’s campaign of mass slaughter and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The outbreak of a larger war in the Middle East (now in a fragile détente) amid expressions of enthusiasm for a violent overthrow of the Iranian leadership. In the US an unprecedented campaign of deportations, leading to civil unrest in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And in all of these situations, there is a great deal of money to be made by a company providing data surveillance and AI systems for military use. The most vivid illustration of this dynamic I have seen is a meme posted to r/PLTR, Reddit’s “unofficial, independent community for retail investors of PLTR to chat about the company, its mission, Alex Karp, and all things pertaining to the stock.” In the background of a photograph taken in a deli or fast-food restaurant, we see a cluster of men involved in a chaotic physical altercation, while in the foreground a middle-aged man sits at a table, entirely unbothered, absorbed in his smartphone. The fighting men are labeled “EUROPE,” “USA,” “ISRAEL,” and “IRAN,” while over the man in the foreground are the words “ME CHECKING THE PRICE OF PALANTIR.” Cofounded in 2003 by Karp and his Stanford friend Peter Thiel, who had recently made serious money from the sale of PayPal to eBay, Palantir Technologies was conceived, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as a provider of machine learning and data analytics for the purposes of national security and surveillance. The reasoning went like this: if the US government had been able, in September 2001, to collate and analyze disparate data points—flight school enrollments, anomalies in travel patterns, suspicious associations—the Twin Towers might still be standing, and the people who died that day might still be alive. Palantir’s software facilitates the finding of patterns in large datasets, and presents such information in easily searchable and navigable form. In a recent conversation with Maureen Dowd for The New York Times, which introduced Karp to the paper’s readers as a “billionaire man of mystery,” he described the work his company does as “the finding of hidden things.” (Karp has been a beneficiary of a near uniformly credulous media, and not just in his native country: in 2016 the German daily Die Welt ran a story about him whose headline translates as “This Genius Is Building the Most Important Company in the World.” Karp, it’s worth pointing out, formerly served on the board of directors of the Axel Springer publishing group, Die Welt’s parent company.) Thiel, a Tolkien obsessive of long standing, named the company after the palantíri in The Lord of the Rings—the “far-seeing stones,” one of which was used by the dark lord Sauron to surveil, from his seat of power in Mordor, the inhabitants of Middle Earth. Palantir’s critics, though, are less inclined to invoke Tolkien than they are Philip K. Dick, whose short story “The Minority Report” concerns an authoritarian future society in which “precrime” detectives arrest people for crimes they have not yet carried out but merely formed the intention of committing. Here’s how Karp put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2009: “What we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based search. So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, there’s lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.” Along with Thiel’s initial investment of $30 million, the company received an early cash injection of $2 million from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Although Palantir also works with corporate clients like Walmart and Wendy’s—which uses Palantir’s AI to manage its inventories of burgers and fries—its earliest and most enduringly important clients were state agencies like the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, for whom it acts as an outsourced provider of intelligence gathering and analytics. During the first Trump term, Palantir became strongly associated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), providing it with surveillance and deportation logistics. Palantir’s FALCON software helped ICE collate and analyze vast amounts of data to map family connections and plan future raids. In 2018 ICE used FALCON to prepare for raids on around a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the US. Advertisement In October 2023, in the days after the attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory, Palantir took out a full-page ad in The New York Times that read, “Palantir stands with Israel.” The following January, by which time the Israeli government’s genocidal response to those attacks had been underway for three months, the company’s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv. While there, Karp and Thiel met with Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, and subsequently signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with AI for advanced targeting capabilities. (In discussing this technology, Karp has used the phrase kill chain, a military term of art that refers to the structure of an attack—the identification of a target, the dispatching of military force to its location, and the assault on and destruction of that target.) The company’s share price began to rise vertiginously. “Hamas really took us to the moon,” as one characteristically elated r/PLTR poster put it. Karp’s personal wealth and his public ebullience rose with it. In February of this year, by which time Palantir’s market value had surpassed that of the Walt Disney Company, Karp appeared in an online video call with retail investors. Dressed in a white T-shirt, Karp delivered an apparently ad hoc speech, his arms spread wide in a show of triumphal grandeur and his graying curls bouncing jauntily. “We’re doing it!” he said. We’re doing it! And I’m sure you’re enjoying this as much as I am…. We are crushing it…. We have dedicated our company to the service of the West, and to the United States of America…. Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. If Hamas took Palantir shareholders to the moon, the return of Donald Trump to the White House, and the subsequent brief and disastrous reign of Elon Musk, took them to Mars. This April it emerged that ICE was paying the company $30 million to develop a software system, known as ImmigrationOS, to track immigrants using biometric and geolocation data. The second Trump administration has deepened Palantir’s already substantial relationship with the federal government, extending its reach across multiple departments. In March Trump signed an executive order directing the government to share data across agencies, raising concerns, as The New York Times put it, that the president “might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power,” and that he might use personal information “to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics.” Palantir’s selection as the main partner for this data-sharing project, the Times reported, was driven by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at least three members of which were known to have formerly worked at Palantir. While all this was going on—while he was becoming America’s highest-paid CEO and facilitating a growing police state at home and a genocidal campaign in Gaza—Karp somehow managed to squeeze in writing a book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he managed to dictate one: The Technological Republic, which was published earlier this year, is credited to both Karp and one Nicholas W. Zamiska, Palantir’s head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the office of the CEO. Speaking with Bari Weiss on her podcast, Karp put it as follows: “I would say, in complete candor, 95 percent plus of the ideas are mine, 90 percent of the writing is his. And the writing is phenomenal.” The writing, I’m sorry to say, is not at all phenomenal; it is uniformly adequate. The division of literary labor, in any case, seems to be such that Karp deployed his own legal counsel in much the same manner as an ordinary person who didn’t want to put in the work might use a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT, throwing out a mess of half-formed ideas to be put into serviceable prose. Advertisement I don’t wish to unduly diminish the contribution of Zamiska, who for all I know may believe that coauthorship of The Technological Republic redounds to his credit, but it’s bad enough having to read and write about this book without also having to mention both these guys every time I refer to it, so I’m going to take Karp’s lead here and proceed on the understanding that the book is essentially his work. And as I made my way sluggishly through its pages—through its business-casual banalities, its pallid apologias for Western civilization and imperial violence—I found myself increasingly preoccupied by a single question: Why did Alexander Karp want to write this thing in the first place? I suspect that his reasons are at least partly related to the Silicon Valley cult of the tech-founder-as-philosopher-king, and have to do with Karp’s desire to be viewed as not just a businessman but also a public intellectual. This book exists, in other words, in order for Karp to have written a book. Much has been made of his academic and intellectual credentials. He has a doctorate in social theory from Frankfurt’s Goethe Universität. (It has often been noted that while he was there he “studied under” Jürgen Habermas, but that appears to be a stretch; according to Die Welt, he wrote to Habermas asking him to supervise his Ph.D., and Habermas passed him along to a colleague.) He quotes Adorno in his shareholder letters. He plays fast and loose with words like hermeneutics and ontology. On the evidence of The Technological Republic, Habermas, whatever his reasons, made the right call. Its thesis can be outlined briefly enough: Silicon Valley, whose foundational companies were built on defense contracts, has strayed too far, for too long, from its original mission. Its prevailing culture, influenced by the “woke” ideas trickling downward from elite institutions of higher education, is such that building technologies to serve the “national interest” has become almost unthinkable for a generation of talented but misguided engineers. These brilliant minds, argues Karp, are being wasted on lucrative but frivolous projects—on-demand laundry services, apps that can bring you a burrito in a taxi, and so on. “The software industry,” he writes, should rebuild its relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face. The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the articulation of a national project—what is this country, what are our values, and for what do we stand. Karp’s friendship with Thiel is often said to be structured around their ideological differences. Thiel, who supported Trump before it was profitable or popular to do so, is widely viewed as a libertarian. Karp has in the past publicly identified as a progressive and has even occasionally, and absurdly, referred to himself as a “socialist.” But in reality Karp is no more a progressive than Thiel—whose fortune is likewise derived largely from government contracts—is a libertarian. Much of The Technological Republic is given over to the kind of broad-strokes antiwokeism that can be found in dispiriting abundance in the nonfiction section of any airport bookstore. One of the book’s four sections is entitled “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”—a typically overripe allusion to Allan Bloom’s classic conservative critique of cultural relativism in American higher education, The Closing of the American Mind. Through this long central section, Karp doesn’t elaborate so much as endlessly restate the argument about Silicon Valley having lost the courage of its foundational convictions. (It is often said that many nonfiction books should really have been magazine articles; this one feels like a LinkedIn post mercilessly stretched to nearly three hundred pages.) The book addresses a 2018 controversy around Project Maven, an AI warfare program for which Google was subcontracted by the Pentagon to provide machine learning and data management software. When the staff circulated a petition protesting the company’s involvement in technologies of war, Google discontinued its work on the project. Karp diagnoses a complacency about national security among younger “elites” who did not live through the geopolitical threats of the twentieth century. “The most capable generation of coders,” he writes, “has never experienced a war or genuine social upheaval. Why court controversy with your friends or risk their disapproval by working for the US military when you can retreat into the perceived safety of building another app?” Palantir stepped in to fill the defense-tech gap left by Google’s cowardly decision, a move that Karp implies should be a template for Silicon Valley’s future. He repeatedly claims that coders who want nothing to do with military technology are suffering from moral atrophy. Though they might seem, to you or me, to be acting on principle—because they oppose war in general or have a specific aversion to serving the interests of empire—they are motivated, he insists, not by a higher cause but by the desire to avoid the opprobrium of their peers. Such people, for Karp, are unwitting victims of self-censorship, who won’t even permit themselves to think about offending the prevailing morals: The dystopian future that Orwell and others have imagined may be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants that rob us of our privacy or most intimate moments alone. It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame for failing to encourage and enable the radical act of belief in something above and beyond, and external to, the self. The speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors—with which we descend on one another for deviations from the norm—only further diminishes our capacity to move toward truth. The book is filled with this sort of sanctimonious guff. If it were just another denunciation of cancel culture, it would be merely boring and belated. But coming from Alexander Karp, the CEO and cofounder of Palantir Technologies, this concern-trolling about a growing censoriousness in “the culture” feels almost intentional in its absurdity. At times I approached the book, perhaps to preserve my own psychic integrity, as an avant-garde exercise in narrative unreliability, an experiment in the dizzying extremes of dramatic irony that I associate most with Charles Kinbote, the comically oblivious narrator of Nabokov’s Pale Fire. Again and again I found myself responding to some sententious lament about Silicon Valley’s lack of moral values by scrawling “You run Palantir!” in the margin. Taken in isolation, Karp’s critique of Silicon Valley—that its most talented engineers and entrepreneurs have no sense of the larger public good—is merely banal, rather than wrong. What makes it deeply strange, and genuinely unsettling, is that what he positions as a moral project worthy of these great talents is essentially an algorithmic arms race with America’s geopolitical rivals. This project is, of course, one that Karp views as a defense of the West and its values. But he has almost nothing to say about these values, which he seems uninterested in even defining, let alone analyzing. One of the more aggravating aspects of the book is Karp’s perpetual gesturing in the general direction of philosophy—of serious subjects and serious engagements with them—without ever actually attempting such a thing. On many occasions, for instance, he invokes the philosophical notion of “the good life,” by way of a claim that the talented tech workers of Silicon Valley, and the culture of which they are a part, have entirely abandoned the question of what might constitute it. “The antiseptic nature of modern discourse,” he writes, dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Silicon Valley, he writes elsewhere, is the product of “a cultural and moral agnosticism if not relativism that assiduously avoided anything approaching substantive views about the good life.” If Karp has any ideas about what “the good life” might actually be, though, he has been extraordinarily successful at keeping them secret. A cynical reader might conclude, in the absence of any other guidance, that perhaps the good life involves becoming a billionaire by selling AI weapons guidance systems and helping governments carry out mass surveillance on their citizens. A more generous reader might conclude that Karp is simply a busy man and doesn’t have the time to think this stuff through. Similarly, the book never delivers on its grandly Platonic title. Not only does Karp fail to describe the “Technological Republic” he invokes; he seems unaware that such a thing might even be expected of him. In this sense, among others, the book reads as the work of someone who wishes to be thought of as a public intellectual but isn’t willing to put in the effort to become one. In the brief passages in which Karp discusses his own leadership of Palantir and his ideas about what constitutes an effective organization, his primary goal is apparently to present himself as an unconventional thinker, by means of strenuously eclectic references—what businesses can learn from the social organization of honeybee swarms, what start-up founders can learn from experimental theater, what Stanley Milgram’s psychological experiments can teach us about creating something new in business, and so on. Such attempts at intellectual grooviness would be risible enough in themselves, were it not for the fact that all this disruptive innovation and free thinking is ultimately in service of a consolidation of state power and business interests—what is normally referred to as the military-industrial complex, which since the end of World War II has been at the root of many long and brutal foreign conflicts, as well as the fortunes of many ruthless and clever opportunists. Another reason The Technological Republic feels strangely untethered is that it seems to have been written toward the prospect of either a second Biden term or a Harris presidency. By the time it was published, in mid-February—when the princelings of Palo Alto were pledging mass fealty at the court of Mar-a-Lago, and Musk’s DOGE was setting about dismantling the federal government—a book-length argument for a closer relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, and for a tech industry aligned with the broader project of American power, had missed its moment. By that point Mark Zuckerberg had shed his liberal skin and undergone a transfiguration into a kind of uncanny-valley MAGA-bro. In late May he announced that Meta would be partnering with the defense-tech company Anduril to “design, build, and field a range of integrated XR [Extended Reality] products that provide warfighters with enhanced perception and enable intuitive control of autonomous platforms on the battlefield.” The partnership between Meta and Anduril is itself evidence of a major cultural shift. The founder of Anduril (also a Tolkien reference, to a sword in The Lord of the Rings) is Palmer Luckey, best known as the inventor of the Oculus Rift VR headset. After Facebook bought Oculus, Luckey was an employee for a time; in 2017 the company fired him after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump group that paid for a billboard campaign deriding Hillary Clinton as “Too Big to Jail.” (Zuckerberg has recently expressed regret about the firing.) Announcing his company’s partnership with Meta, Luckey said, “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” One gadget Anduril is developing is called Eagle Eyes—a headset that provides “warfighters” with “360° threat awareness.” Luckey has invoked the video games Call of Duty and Halo. “The idea,” he said, “is to give warfighters superhuman vision, superhuman perception, superhuman hearing, and allow them to communicate with each other and large teams of autonomous systems.” Anduril is precisely the kind of project to which Karp, in The Technological Republic, argues engineers should be devoting their talents. “All these people who used to be tech bros are now defense tech bros,” as Noam Perski, Palantir’s international government lead, put it in a speech last December at a defense tech summit in Tel Aviv. Recently a venture capitalist friend told me that he knew several people in Silicon Valley who, just a few years ago, would have walked briskly in the opposite direction of anything remotely military-related, and who were now working on defense tech. When I agreed that there did seem to be something of a change in the ideological microclimates of the Bay Area, he said that there was no something of about it; it was a hard pivot, and an exceptionally fertile one for investors. See, for instance, Daniel Ek, the cofounder and CEO of Spotify, who led a recent €600 million investment into the German start-up Helsing. The company, cofounded by a video game developer and a former employee of Germany’s defense ministry, makes military drones and AI software for weapons systems and to improve battlefield decision-making. (Spotify subscribers may be interested to know that simply by streaming, say, Bob Dylan’s “Masters of War” or Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” they can now help to fund the international arms trade.) In June the US Army launched something called Executive Innovation Corps, which it described in a press release as “a new initiative designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation.” Under the program, four high-level tech executives were commissioned into the army reserve as lieutenant colonels. The four new officers were Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar; Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth; OpenAI’s chief product officer, Kevin Weil; and Bob McGrew, an adviser at Thinking Machines Lab who was formerly OpenAI’s chief research officer. The tech execs were sworn in on Friday, June 13. On Monday, the next day of trading, Palantir shares closed at an all-time high. If you want to know what a technological republic might look like, forget Alexander Karp’s insipid book; consider what is being constructed around you, and how little it resembles any kind of republic at all. Consider the bad times, and who they are good for.

Title: As the US stock market smashes records, some investors fear it’s overpriced

US stocks are pricier than ever before by some measures, raising fears that the market could be headed for a crash. By John Power The US stock market has been having a stellar run – so much so that many investors fear it is overpriced. Since early 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has risen more than 60 percent, hitting all-time highs despite headwinds ranging from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs to concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) may be overhyped. For investors, the explosive growth has come at a cost: by some measures, US stocks are pricier than ever before. An investor buying into the S&P 500 last week had to fork over $3.25 for every $1 in revenues generated by its 500 constituent firms, according to GuruFocus, the highest price-to-sales ratio on record. While US stocks look less expensive when compared against forecasts of company profits, the benchmark index is still trading at more than 22 times forward earnings, well above the historical average. In a poll by Bank of America last month, nine out of 10 fund managers surveyed said they viewed US stocks as overvalued. The market’s sky-high valuation has led some analysts to draw comparisons to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. Fueled by excitement over the rise of the Internet, shares on the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared about 80 percent before giving up almost all of their gains between 2000 and 2022. “Nobody knows what a stock is really worth because its value is based on future earnings,” said James Angel, an expert on financial markets at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Only God knows what the future holds. Because of this uncertainty, stock prices always have been and always will be very volatile. A small change in the market’s consensus estimate of future performance can lead to a large and sudden change in value.” Even as investors are increasingly expressing qualms about the price of US stocks, they are not staying away. The S&P 500 set five all-time highs in August alone and is up about 10 percent so far this year, putting it on track to comfortably beat its average annual return in 2025. Analysts have offered a range of explanations for the market’s untrammelled ascent, including the remarkable profitability of the “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Alphabet – and the as yet untapped potential of AI. “Earnings at US companies have held up surprisingly well, and continue to grow,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “AI may have driven up the value of a couple of the big tech companies and companies that build AI architecture, but it cannot explain the overall rise in the rest of the market,” Damodaran added. While the market’s heavy reliance on the “Magnificent Seven” has been a source of concern for some investors – they make up about one-third of the S&P 500 – such concentration is not unprecedented. Robert E Wright, lecturer in the Department of Economics at Central Michigan University, said the dynamic of a few companies dominating the market can be found as far back as the late 18th century. “Banks were the most important technology of the time, followed by property insurers,” Wright said. “Later came textile mills and other manufacturers, then railroads and, eventually, automobiles. We cannot get too precise due to differences in the way capitalisation was measured, but the pattern seems the same: innovations leads to success, which leads to investment and more success until commodification. Then innovation in a different field occurs and the cycle begins anew.” More prosaic explanations have been offered for the market’s stellar performance, too, such as the shift away from actively managed mutual funds toward passive index funds in recent decades. The increasing popularity of funds that track the S&P500 and other broad measures of the market means that more people are buying stocks regardless of economic conditions than in the past. But a bigger factor than any economic metric could be human psychology. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Bayes Business School in the UK, said that herd behaviour provides a better explanation for stock market moves than the performance of businesses or the state of the economy. “The only tried and tested investment strategy with both international, cross asset and historical support is ‘momentum,’ ie, what goes up carries on rising until it doesn’t,” Thomas said. “Fund managers can’t afford to get left behind their competitors,” Thomas added. “And these are using momentum either explicitly or quietly. So they are behaving rationally in terms of firm behaviour, and indeed, in terms of our knowledge of investment strategies.” There is no way to accurately predict a stock market crash. But steep falls are a regular feature of the market. Since the end of World War II, the market has dropped 20 percent or more from its peak 15 times. While the market rebounded to its peak within a few years in most of those cases, the worst crashes kept investors in the red for much longer. Investors hit by the double whammy of the dot-com bust and the 2008-09 global financial crisis did not fully recover their losses for nearly 13 years. But if there is one thing that financial experts are practically unanimous on, it is that attempting to time the market is a fool’s errand. “One reason that waiting to see a trend is so dangerous is that some of the best up days in the market follow soon after the worst down days,” Angel said. “The best year in US stock market history was in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression. The market had gone down so much, that when it became clear that a recovery was under way, the market rallied rapidly.” Burton Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said investors who feel they are at the limits of their risk tolerance are better off shifting the balance of their portfolios towards lower-risk assets, such as bonds and holding onto more cash than trying to time the market. “You will invariably get it wrong and in the long run the US will eventually straighten things out,” he said.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Dogecoin’s backers moved quickly this week to create what they call the first official DOGE treasury, pushing $175 million into a vehicle aimed at buying Dogecoin and bringing more institutional muscle to the token. According to reports, the fund was set up through a private placement that issued 175,000,420 pre-funded warrants priced at $1 each, a structure meant to provide immediate capital for purchases. The plan has drawn big-name crypto firms and traditional investors. Based on reports, the financing raised $175 million in total. Over 80 institutional and crypto-native investors are said to have taken part, with names like Pantera, GSR, FalconX, Mythos and Borderless listed among participants. The offering is expected to close around September 4, 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the formal listing of the new warrants. CleanCore Solutions $ZONE is converting to become the first ever Dogecoin Treasury company in partnership with the House of Doge. Stock immediately plummets 59%. What a world. pic.twitter.com/xqHYHXixYu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 2, 2025 The company tied to the move is CleanCore Solutions, which will house the program alongside a commercial arm called House of Doge. Markets reacted fast. CleanCore’s share price fell about 60%, sliding from roughly $6.85 to near $2.69 after the arrangement was disclosed. That drop reflected investor worries about dilution, execution risk, and how public markets would view a corporate play centered on a meme token. Trading in the warrants and the conversion mechanics were flagged by analysts as key details investors will watch closely. Reports have disclosed a noteworthy lineup of people and advisors. Alex Spiro, who has been publicly identified as an attorney for Elon Musk, is named to serve as Chairman of the Board at CleanCore. Timothy Stebbing, Director at the Dogecoin Foundation and CTO of House of Doge, will join CleanCore’s board, while Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is slated to act as CleanCore’s Chief Investment Officer. The crypto-ETF firm 21Shares will advise on governance, capital allocation and strategy for the treasury. Those moves were described in filings and press releases tied to the deal. The effort aims to move Dogecoin from pure meme status toward something that can be held in a corporate reserve and used for payments, tokenization efforts, and other financial uses. According to statements circulating with the financing documents, the treasury would buy DOGE with the raised capital and could help create institutional-grade products around the token. Details about custody, trading rules and how purchases will be executed were not fully spelled out in initial disclosures.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: People don't trust social media firms on fraud protection
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0903/1531552-bank-of-ireland-fraud-warning/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T08:40:25Z

Research commissioned by Bank of Ireland for its latest fraud awareness campaign reveals that 91% of its customers believe social media firms should be banned from profiting off fraudulent ads. 90% of survey participants also say that financial service advertisers on social media should be required to prove their legitimacy, Bank of Ireland added. Bank of Ireland also said that seven in ten social media users do not trust social media companies to protect them from fraud and 73% distrust the ads they see on these platforms. The bank said its fraud research, which was conducted by Red C in August, reveals that 83% of consumers believe that fraud is a big problem in society today, while 76% said the risk of fraud scams makes them wary when they shop online. Meanwhile, 86% of those seeing fraudulent content on social media platforms said they saw it on Meta platforms, while 91% feel social media companies should not be allowed generate revenue from fraudsters placing ads on their platforms. 90% also feel that companies that advertise financial services on social media platforms should have to prove that the ads are genuine and the company is registered with the Central Bank. Nicola Sadlier, Head of Fraud at Bank of Ireland, said that social media platforms have become a lucrative hunting ground for fraudsters and consumers are paying the price while technology giants gain revenue. "With results from the latest RED C survey, seven in ten consumers now distrusting social media companies to shield them from fraud, and over 90% demanding an end to platforms profiting from scam ads, the message is clear - the public wants protection," she said. "It's time for increased accountability, not just algorithms," she added. Through extensive public affairs and PR activity, Bank of Ireland has been campaigning for a change in legislation to better protect consumers from fraud originating on social media channels. The bank today also issued a warning about "pump and dump" WhatsApp investment scams - where fraudsters lure victims via fake social media ads to join an investment WhatsApp group. Posing as a financial investment expert, the fraudster then spreads misleading information to group members about particular companies/stocks. Group members then buy the stock, the price is pumped up due to the increased demand and when the price peaks, the scammers sell (dump) their holdings at a profit, and disappear, Bank of Ireland explains. Professor Mary Aiken said that fraud online is now an industrialised, platform-enabled phenomenon. "Scammers leverage the same targeting and engagement tools legitimate advertisers use; the difference is that families and businesses bear the cost," the Professor said. "Bank of Ireland's findings, which show that seven in ten users distrust platform protection and over 90% want an end to profits from scam ads, reveal an overwhelming public appetite for reform," she said. "The solution is safety by design, verifying financial advertisers, building friction and warnings into investment journeys, and enforcing clear accountability when systems enable harm. If platforms can target us to buy, they can target protections to keep us safe," she added. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Analysts are calling Google's antitrust decision 'broadly favorable' and 'benign'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-analysts-google-antitrust-decision-take-favorable-benign-stock-target-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T05:47:18Z

The verdict on Google's lengthy lawsuit is out, and analysts say the search giant left the room largely unscathed. Nearly five years after the Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Google, a district judge on Tuesday ruled that Google won't have to divest its Chrome or YouTube businesses. Instead, District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling said that Google will be barred from entering exclusive contracts with partners such as Apple to give its search engine priority, and it will be forced to share some data with rivals. Google's stock jumped 6.7% after hours following the decision. In post-ruling reactions, analysts called the decision "benign" and said that it finally removed a "significant overhang" on Google's stock. "The judge's decision largely surrounded opening up portions of Google's search technology to competitors rather than trying to disrupt its distribution framework (ie divesting Chrome) which seemed like the more adverse risk to us," RBC Capital analysts led by Brad Erickson wrote in a note on Tuesday. "The path for compounding earnings growth along with multiple expansion hasn't looked this clear in some time," the RBC analysts added. RBC raised its price target for the company from $220 to $260 on Tuesday. Alphabet, Google's parent company, closed at $212 on Tuesday. Analysts at Wedbush titled their note, "Government Folds Like Cheap Suit" and wrote: "The outcome is broadly favorable for Google, in our view, with the court ruling against the most severe remedy proposals introduced by the DOJ." The Wedbush analysts led by Scott Devitt shared three reasons they are bullish on Google and think its stock is being punished compared to Big Tech peers like Meta. First, they said that Tuesday's decision removed "lingering risks" associated with the worst-case outcome for the company. Second, they said that the impact of generative AI rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity is fading. Lastly, they added that Google's leadership is "repositioning the business as a winner in the AI space, with strong demand trends and an acceleration in Cloud growth." Wedbush raised its stock price target from $225 to $245 on Tuesday. Google's stock has risen 11.3% year to date. Jump to

Title: Can Google Stock Unlock $1 Trillion After Antitrust Victory?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/03/can-google-stock-unlock-1-trillion-after-antitrust-victory/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T05:46:03Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google’s shareholders had plenty to celebrate in after-hours trading on Tuesday, September 2nd, with the stock jumping 7% following what can only be described as a major legal victory after a federal judge ruled that Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of the antitrust penalties – a decision that removes one of the biggest clouds hanging over the tech giant. Separately, see – Buy META Stock Over Amazon? Let's be honest here – losing Chrome would have been catastrophic for Google. We're not talking about just another product in their portfolio. Chrome is absolutely central to Google's business model, serving as the gateway that funnels billions of users toward Google's search engine and, ultimately, its advertising goldmine. The browser's value to Google? We've estimated it in the trillions. Investors were relieved when they heard this asset was safe. That said, the ruling wasn't entirely in Google's favor. Judge Amit Mehta did put some guardrails in place, specifically blocking Google from entering exclusive search contracts like the lucrative deal it has with Apple. However, the company can still pursue deals that make Chrome the default browser option – a meaningful distinction that preserves much of Chrome's strategic value. Before we get too carried away, it's worth remembering that Google still faces another significant legal hurdle. A separate US court found last year that the company illegally monopolized online search and advertising markets, with the final verdict due on September 10. That's less than a week away, and it could still pose meaningful risks. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Here's where things get particularly compelling from an investment standpoint. Google has been trading at a significant discount to its Big Tech peers, largely due to these regulatory headwinds. While Amazon trades at 35 times trailing earnings, Microsoft at 37 times, and Meta at 28 times, Google was sitting at just 22 times as of yesterday's close. This valuation gap never quite made sense when you consider Google's fundamentals. The company has been firing on all cylinders lately – solid revenue growth, improving profitability margins, and a dominant position in search and cloud. The regulatory overhang was essentially the only thing keeping that multiple compressed. Here’s the kicker: If Google's valuation multiple were to rise to 35 times – similar to Amazon and Microsoft – it would translate into stock levels over $320, implying roughly 50% upside from current levels. We're talking about potentially adding over $1 trillion to the company's market cap. That's not just a nice boost for shareholders; it's a fundamental re-rating of one of the world's most profitable businesses. Of course, this kind of re-rating will likely have to wait for the September 10 ruling to provide more clarity on the regulatory front. And let’s be clear – there are still meaningful risks that could weigh on Google’s stock performance, which we’ve discussed in detail in our separate analysis on Google’s Valuation, Growth Drivers, and Key Risks. Yesterday's ruling feels like a turning point for Google's stock. The company has been delivering strong operational performance while trading at a discount due to regulatory uncertainty. With one major threat now off the table, investors are starting to price in the possibility that Google's valuation multiple could finally start catching up to its peers. While Google is not completely in the clear yet – that September 10 verdict still looms – this development suggests the worst-case scenarios for the company may be behind us. For a stock that’s been performing well operationally but struggling with regulatory baggage, that’s exactly the kind of catalyst that could unlock significant value.

Title: OpenAI buys software testing startup Statsig for $1.1B and creates a new role for its CEO
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/02/openai-buys-software-testing-startup-statsig-1-1b-creates-new-role-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T01:39:00Z

UPDATED 21:39 EDT / SEPTEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley OpenAI said today it’s buying Statsig Inc. in a $1.1 billion deal that’s just as much of an acquihire as it is about bringing the product testing startup’s technology into its fold. As part of the deal, Statsig founder and Chief Executive Vijaye Raji (pictured), who previously worked as a software engineer at Meta Platforms Inc., will join OpenAI as its new chief technology officer of applications, a new role for the company. He will report directly to OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo, who joined the company from Instacart earlier this year. “As part of this transition, we’re acquiring Statsig, one of the most trusted experimentation platforms in the industry — powering A/B testing, feature flagging, and real-time decisioning for some of the world’s most innovative companies, including OpenAI,” the company said in an announcement. The $1.1 billion price tag matches the valuation of Statsig following its most recent $100 million funding round in May. Because there’s no premium being paid, that suggests Statsig and its investors are confident that OpenAI itself will continue to grow its value. The deal needs regulatory approval to proceed, but that’s expected to be a formality. Once the deal closes, Statsig will continue to operate as an independent entity at its Seattle-based headquarters, serving its existing customers, which include OpenAI. Statsig’s employees will be given the option to transition to OpenAI if they wish. Founded in 2021, Statsig helps customers including OpenAI to test new software features with select groups of users and gather feedback so companies can decide if they need to tweak anything, roll it out as it is, or cancel the new feature completely. The startup counts 155 employees on its books, and after its latest funding round said it plans to grow its team to around 200 by the end of 2026. It’s not clear if it’s still planning to do so. Raji has previously made headlines for implementing what is a relatively unusual policy these days of insisting that all staff work at the company’s office five days per week. By prohibiting remote work, he claims to have created a culture that fosters greater collaboration, speed and innovation. “Working with the incredible team at OpenAI to build AI-powered experiences at scale for people and businesses is a rare and meaningful opportunity,” Raji wrote in a blog post. “Doing that with the help of tools we built at Statsig makes it even more special.” There’s a growing trend among not only enterprises but also software vendors to snap up anyone who’s considered as a “hot AI talent”, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. ignited the trend in June, when it made a string of moves in quick succession to secure the services of former Scale AI Inc. CEO Alexandr Wang, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and then Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross. “Google has also made moves to bring aboard more AI talent, and now OpenAI is playing the same game,” Mueller said. “Hiring or acqui-hiring talent is the way to go now, and this is how OpenAI’s purchase of Statsig will be seen. But Statsig also provides some valuable capabilities in the area of A/B testing which should be useful, and that points to the growing ambitions of OpenAI in the consumer space.” S. “Soma” Somasegar, managing director of Madrona Ventures and an early investor in Statsig, said in his own blog post that the startup is a natural fit for OpenAI because of its “world-class product velocity” and its obsession with helping customers. He added that Statsig’s data-driven approach has helped it to become one of the leading intelligent application design companies, and believes that OpenAI will help it to “extend its impact while keeping its mission front and center.” OpenAI recently closed on its own, much bigger fundraising in March, which saw it collect $40 billion from investors, bringing its valuation to a sky-high $300 billion. The artificial intelligence giant wasted little time in putting that money to use. Just two months later, in May, it snapped up Jony Ive’s AI devices startup IO Products Inc. for around $6.4 billion to support its efforts to “create a new generation of AI-powered computers.” OpenAI was also said to be interested in buying the generative AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but the negotiations apparently broke down. Then, in July, Google LLC managed to entice Windsurf’s co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen to join its own AI team, as part of a $2.4 billion technology licensing deal. Days later, another AI coding startup called Cognition AI Inc. swooped in to acquire Windsurf, minus its co-founders.

Today, we have the most exciting, the most brilliant, the most notorious Mordy Oberstein on the show. And we’re diving into a provocative topic that should be on every brandbuilderss radar. And that is why brands should stop relying on Google. We’re gonna unpack that with Mordy. Who’s Mordy? He’s a voice many of you will know from the SEO world, if you’re from that space, because he’s a previous head of SEO branding at Wix. He’s the host of multiple marketing podcasts. He’s one of the sharpest minds out there when it comes to decoding search algorithms and the shifting landscape of online visibility. But today, in this episode, it’s not your standard SEO chat, although there’s a place for standard SEO chats, nothing against those. But today on JUST Branding, we’re going to be focusing in on branding and SEO being found online in the age of AI, with the rise of large language models, can’t even say that, LLMs. What does that mean for Discovery, for your brand? What does that mean in terms of traditional thinking about Google, about SEO, about ranking? And what kind of does that mean in terms of your brand? What it might mean in terms of holding your brand back if you’re not embracing some of these new ways of being found? So with all that kind of in place, Mordy, welcome to the show. Wow, that’s quite the intro. Also, like, I’m notorious. Nice, I’m notorious MOB. Yeah, well, you know me, I like to, you know, I like to give us some zip and some vigor. And also, you know, you definitely are notorious. And, you know, I’m thrilled to have you on the show. And so is Jacob. So welcome. Listen, let’s start off with perhaps a provocation. Why shouldn’t brands rely on Google anymore in your view? Because they never should have to begin with. Tell me more. So first, if you’re talking about building a brand, and I’m sorry to tell you, if you’re coming from the SEO space, you’re listening to this, this is going to sound like a heresy. If you’re not, you’re like, this makes good natural sense. Google search is a hard way to build brand. I feel brand is a lot about consistency over time. And search is all about not consistency over time. You don’t know where you’re going to wait, where you’re going to show up, when you’re going to show up. It’s hard to build that consistency, to really build that presence, to really build that connection with your audience through the medium of Google search. That’s hard. I’m just saying it can’t happen or doesn’t help your brand, but building a brand that way, that seems backwards to me. Sure. So how would you put it the other way around? What would you say the focus should be before we dive back into the backwards? So Google always has been, and this is where I think it’s becoming okay, what kind of vehicle? But it’s a vehicle. It’s a vehicle to help you be found. It’s a vehicle to help you spread your content. It’s a vehicle to do a lot of different things. And the conversation around what is Google from a search and traffic point of view has shifted back to, okay, it’s a vehicle, it’s not a be-all end-all. What type of vehicle is it? Is it an AI, I don’t know, 2025 Audi? Or is it a 1987 Chevy? How reliable is it? Yeah, let me ask you about that because, as I said in the introduction, we’re seeing the rise of AI and lots of different things that are coming around. I mean, if we just keep it specifically to Google just for a second, what are the big shifts that you’re seeing in the way that Google itself is working? The biggest shift that I can point to was August 2018. There’s a thing called the MEDIC update. So Google has been doing, so Google has an algorithm, and every once in a while it presses a button and updates this algorithm. Starting in March of 2018, they started to announce what they call core algorithm updates. So they’ve always had core algorithm updates, but a Google spokesperson wasn’t announcing them each time. In March 2018, they started to announce these things. The biggest and most famous one of them is what we call the MEDIC update, which is really the August 2018 core update. It’s a really annoying name to say. Predominantly because it hit what’s called the YMYL space, your money, your life, health, things that impact your health and finances. And what we saw happening with that algorithm was Google was better able in new ways to understand content quality. And since then, it’s been progressively trying to rely less on, to put like, SEO stuff, well, links, all that kind of like SEO stuff, and predominantly on, is the content across the website, not just the web page, is the content across the website good quality? And it’s made certain shifts, it has made certain jumps, and it redefines what quality is. For example, Google has actual raters, I don’t know if people know about this, there are people called quality raters, and they’re paid by Google to look at content, look at a web page, say, is this good or is this bad? Obviously, like, completely oversimplifying this. And they have a set of guidelines called Google’s Quality Raters Guidelines, or the QRG, because we like abbreviations in SEO, everything’s got to have an abbreviation. The raters’ guidelines change over time, and of course, SEOs fight about everything, and is Google using these things that it’s telling its quality raters to look at, is it using it in the algorithm or not? So certain SEOs, no, certain SEOs, yes, certain SEOs, like myself, who cares? Obviously, it’s what they want. So sooner or later, they’re gonna start interjecting it at some point. But those, you can see how Google defines quality content shifting. And it makes so much sense because everyone looks at this like, oh, it’s an AI issue. Right now, it’s happening. It’s not an AI issue. It’s a perfect storm. Google has something that’s called EAT, and I swear I’ll stop with acronyms. It stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. It’s basically a fancy way of saying, is your content not rubbish and is it good? And in whatever year, Google added an extra E for experience, like two or three years ago. So now it’s E-E-A-T, Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Why Experience? And Google wrote a whole blog post. You don’t have to, I’m not like making like, oh no, why do they do that? They have a post about why they did this. And they said, because we see that people are looking for more firsthand knowledge among the search results. That’s Google saying, we have the world’s largest data set and we’re really good at predicting where people are, how they’re behaving and where they’re going. And we see they’re going to TikTok. And that our interpretation of that is they want more firsthand knowledge. So what Google then did was that doesn’t, by the way, that doesn’t exist on the Internet. Because Google didn’t ever incentivize that. Google incentivized for years five ways to show that I have no actual human experience, but we’ll tell you what I think anyway. And it needed to somehow pull that content in. So a fire hose read it onto its result page. And that’s when the whole thing kind of like went topsy-turvy. Because Google’s trying to add content that it didn’t have, and the only way it has is Reddit. And Reddit, I don’t know if anybody likes it, is a sewer. And it literally like just superimposes sewer onto the SERP. Ah, I did another acronym, Search Engine Results Page, the Google page. And then on top of that, now you have the whole AI thing. So it’s a disaster. The perfect storm. The perfect storm of mess and algorithms loving it so far. A couple of other quick things. And so, in relation to the AI overviews that you now start to see, so is that coming from Reddit or is that Google’s own AI engine? How’s that working? So now you’re stuck. Like now, I’ll Google, I’ll say, best place to get a coffee mug. And instead of it going to, first of all, Google will do a show like a landing page that wired.com used to have because everybody should ring for everything. That makes sense. That started to change as a different conversation. And a lot of people, a lot of the rankings you hear people say they’re losing. HubSpot is an example. HubSpot lost all its rankings. HubSpot lost all its crap rankings that don’t actually matter. HubSpot lost what’s the best coffee mug. As that’s happening, it’s harder for me to even rank because what’s showing up for best coffee mug used to be my website. Now it’s Reddit. And everyone telling me where the best coffee mug is. Now on top of that, you have AI overviews. And AI overviews are a mess. They’re pulled in. It’s an LLM. So it’s pulled in from content across the web. They do cite. It’s… I’m going to say something controversial. Is that OK to say anything? Yeah? Sure. Go for it. AI overviews are basically like a bastardized product. And they were never meant to come out. The only reason AI overviews exist is because Chad GPT and Bing beat Google to the punch. There was a famous conference that Bing announced co-pilot. Google had no idea it was coming and they were caught off guard. Google then ran, like, their own event a month, a month, like, two weeks later in Paris, showcasing a bunch of stupid things no one actually cared about. And that’s when the conversation of, ooh, it’s Google dying, started to come out. Two months after that was Google’s big conference, Google IO. They just had one relatively recently. This is IO. 2023. And they announced what was called back then SGE, Search Generative Experience. What is with all the freaking acronyms? SGE became AIO reviews. Why did they announce SGE? They didn’t roll it out. They just announced, like, here’s what it’s going to look like. Because they were getting killed, their stock was getting killed. Because Bing beat them to the punch. ChatGPT beat them to the punch. They had to announce something. Fast forward a year later, they already announced this thing. They have to release it now. Because, like, now what? You announced it a year ago and it’s your next Google IO big conference thing? You didn’t, you’ve done nothing? Got to announce it, otherwise the stock’s gonna crash. So they released it. And that’s why we have AIO reviews. What they really want to release, what they announced this year, which is AI. Mode. AI. Mode is more of a one-to-one competitor with Chad GPT, it’s better in general, it’s still a mess. So check this out. Google is running parallel products that cannibalize each other, on purpose. And at some point, somebody big is gonna lose their job over it. Wowzers, wowzers. All right, okay. Well, pause, pause, pause. Okay, we got a lot of brand builders on the call, right? Listening in on the call, on the show, listening to the show, right? It’s not cool. They’re not calling in. Don’t worry. No, can we take South of Staten Island? I would love to have a call. Yeah, absolutely. It would be great to do a call-in. Sometimes, hang on, actually pin that. We’ll have to do that, Jacob, at some point, do a little LinkedIn call-in or something. But I think what I want to ask is just bring it back down to brand builders just for a minute. In your view, then, what does all of that mean for discoverability, right? Because that’s ultimately, you know, people building brands, they want to make sure that they are salient, they’re in the minds of people, you know, searching for what they’ve got to offer. And obviously, we all hit Google mostly to get to that, you know? So, what does that mean? What does that mean to brands in all this mess and confusion and AI robotics that you’ve been talking about? I always want to be able to roll my Rs and I’m just sitting here jealous. I’ve totally lost it, like you lost it, I don’t even know what to say now. What does it mean to brands? Yeah, so, first of all, for brand builders, this is great, I’m a weirdo. I’ve sat on both the performance side of marketing and on the brand side of marketing. So, I see both sides disturbing. This is great for brand builders. What makes this difficult right now is that you’re dealing with a company who’s not functioning logically, right? They’re not functioning. By the way, if you want, there’s a great interview with The Verge and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, I highly recommend you watch that if you really want to get a nerd’s eye view kind of thing. But they’re not functioning. I want to say a lot. They are functioning rationally, but their context of what is rational, what’s not rational is in a different orbit than us. They’re functioning for their stock price, and they’re functioning in a way that it’s hard to end up saying, what does this ultimately look like? For example, you’re currently running two products. One of these are going to die out. AI Overs are going to die out. It’s very clear. Who’s pretty much basically said it. And they’re going to move to what’s AI called AI Mo, which if you’re in the US, you now have access to it. If you’re not in the US, you can’t see it. But it’s more like a chat GPT-ish kind of thing. So you need to figure out, okay, we want to know is you need to be able to read what the hell is actually going on. Where does this end up? And what does it end up looking like? Because if you’re just chasing like, okay, we need to get into the AI overview. Well, that’s going to go away. Okay, we need to get into AI mode. Okay, so question, if AI mode, which is currently a separate tab, you know, like on Google, you have tabs for images and videos, a separate tab, AI mode. If it replaces AI overviews, there’s not going to be a separate tab for AI mode. As someone who’s worked on products, do you know why there’s a separate tab on the left for AI mode? Because they couldn’t figure out a way to run both products in the same place. And the guy, well, the best place to put it is on the left-hand side up there. It’s not like a strategic decision. It was just a mechanics problem. How does that end up getting integrated into the main SERP, into the main result page? My advice, there are multiple corrections that need to happen. And one correction is that this stuff is very expensive and it’s not going to last for free forever. I always knew it was a data center that cost the most money. I didn’t realize what part of it cost the most money. It’s cooling the data centers. The water cost the most money. And yeah, I didn’t know that like two weeks ago. Someone told me. Right? Super interesting. It can’t last for free. The only reason it’s lasting for free right now is because all of these companies are now, their bottom line is their stock price. At a certain point, the hype dies down and the ability to pump up that stock price with whatever new hype dies down with it. So now you have to switch to a cost flow, I’m sorry, cash flow model. Then this thing comes crashing down, because how do you keep offering for free? They have to monetize it, which they haven’t been able to figure out how to monetize it. So you know, that’s one, you know that it can’t end up looking this way because they haven’t been able to monetize it yet, and they have to figure out how to monetize it. They need to figure out how to bring costs down, which they announced we brought costs down, and then they need to figure out how to monetize it in a real way. I think it’ll probably end up like YouTube, where I run five prompts, and then a big interstitial ad comes up. I got to watch a video or whatever it is, then click skip, and then I get to ask Google the rest of my prompts. The second part of that is, does the AI hype last forever? And I swear I’m going to answer your question. If you think the AI hype lasts forever, then fine. Just optimize to get into whatever this thing is right now. And we can talk about what that would actually mean. If you think the AI hype is not going to last forever, like, any hype cycle, it’s going to die down. I feel like it already is. Now we’re talking about agendic AI. Like here, please take my wallet and spend money all over the internet for me. That’s exact. Sure, that’s a good idea. You already see like the AI, LLM generation, content generation, kind of dying down a little bit, and there’s more and more pushback. My wife’s a great example. She’s a nurse. She went to a conference about how to, what to know about AI as a nurse and she was like, I can’t believe this crap is going on. The world is doomed. So people are more skeptical also. By the way, when you know, people sitting around the dinner table saying, hey, SAI stuff is great, huh? And then when they have to hand over their credit card so it can buy new pants for it online, I don’t know how like, yay, hey, great. It’s gonna be the same way. Like people are funny when they have to open, they hand over their credit card number, which means, and Google was asked this in the interview I referenced, wow, I’m really going like full circle on full circle on full circle. And their CEO said he doesn’t think that the era of exploration is over, meaning I just want an answer and I’m done. But that’s what AI currently does. And I’m a former teacher and I’ll tell you, like, I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that human mind is constructed. I don’t want to know anything. Just give me the answer on what I’m done. What I’m done. For certain things, it definitely wants that. For certain things, you want to be able to explore more things. I had like a small medical issue. I don’t know, like, come on. It’s like, no big deal. I’m fine. I didn’t want the typical answers and the typical websites Google was giving me. I wanted to go a little bit deeper and explore. So what I think the AI is going to end up looking like, and this is probably a good point to, like, discuss, when Google announced Gemini originally, which is their AI property, they showcased, they can’t do it yet. They have experimented with it a little bit. It showcased an example. If I ask it one question, I get one set of results that formatted one way. So if I ask it, like, what’s a great idea for a nine-year-old girl’s birthday party on the beach? And the layout and the type of results match that type of query, of search. Where if I ask it, what’s the best beard to, what’s the best brush to brush my beard with? It might list a totally different set of examples, and in a different layout all together. I think that’s where we’re heading. We’re headed to a place where it’s almost like a content portal. It’ll give you a summary, whatever you want, the LLM. You could explore more, but it’s going to open entry points so that you can explore deeper, which means that we’re about to enter an era, I think, of not expansion, the web is shrinking, which is another point we could talk about, but refinement. And if you want to, if you want your brand to align with what’s happening and getting into these LLMs, it’s about honing down that brand identity so that people, first of all, that you know who the hell you are, which is a whole conversation we can talk about is a mess, so that your audience knows who you are, so they can start talking about you across the internet, and then the LLMs can pick up on all of that. sponsored message Wow, there’s a lot there. There’s a lot of time back. Just a quick reminder, the Brand Builders Summit is back this September 16 to 19. It’s free online and features 40 branding legends covering strategy, design and business. Head over to brandbuilderssummit.com to grab your free ticket. Now back to the show. Mordy, I have to ask about this shrinking internet thing, because as far as I understand, like the internet is like just getting spammed with so much content that it’s just like expanding. And so I’d love to hear your take on that. So this is great. I mean, it’s not great. Depends how you look at it. It’s interesting, put it that way. So, the verge, I forgot his name, Vilai Patel asked Google this question. He asked the CEO of Google this same question. He said, is it harder for people to get traffic? Are things just seem to be like constricting? He goes, no, we’re in an expansionary era right now. And his answer back was, there are more web pages than ever. That’s not what he asked. He asked more traffic. Yeah, there’s definitely more web pages than ever. There’s not more traffic than ever. So, I have data in this. I used to be the head of ComBit Center, which I still consult for Center, which is like an SEO data tool thing. I still spill the beans that I’m talking about doing next week, but maybe this is not going to come out before then. So, I’m not spilling beans, tea. I don’t know what people say anymore. But basically, the data shows and they talk about this in the interview. The web is kind of just plateaued. Like, you always think about it, the web should be like the stock market is always going up, which if you’re ever in the stock market is not how it works. Since COVID, so COVID was the peak, you could see web traffic, however you slice it, whether it’s like total traffic across the web, average monthly visits a site is going to get, comes down after 2021 or the middle of 2021, and it levels out. Over the course of 2024, there’s a 2% difference between where it was in 2021, meaning it’s leveled out and we have 2% growth in three years, which is nothing. 2% is like what I have in my milk. That’s not growth. So we’re pushing more and more and more content out there, more content than ever. And it’s stagnating, which to me says that it’s shrinking because we’re propping it up with all this content and it’s still not growing and it’s still stagnating. All right. Curious. Bad news for the bears, I guess. Yeah. Good news for your brand though, I feel like. Why is that? Because if you can double down and have some real identity, people understand who you are, they can connect with you, you have some kind of reason to exist that has a level of depth, a level of meaning to it. And you’re refining that. First off, you’re so far ahead of the curve right now. And you can stand out because no one’s doing that. But you can’t get found in search, so is it relevant anyway? Yeah, there’s a lot of ways to get found. sponsored message Yeah. Well, let’s talk about traditional SEO, because we’ve talked about AI and Reddit just pushing out results further and further on the page. Is there any room for traditional SEO? Has it evolved into anything else? What’s your take? It depends, is always the SEO answer. If you’re a technical SEO, so you’re somebody who makes sure that you’re working for CNN, I don’t know, or one of these big news websites, thousands and millions of pages, and you’re making sure that their pages can be crawled and indexed by Google, they’re served quickly to users, all those technical things, that’s very much still a job. Like in and of its own right, regardless of any of this, you need someone to make sure that all of these bots can come access, crawl the page, and do whatever they do with it, whether it’s an LLM bot or whether it’s Google, whether it’s Bing, whatever it is. So that’s definitely still a thing. The traditional SEO of going out there and like, you know, we’re going to change the heading on the page and we’re going to go after SEO keywords. I think that was stupid for a long time. I think it’s really stupid now. And for a variety of reasons. One is that’s not how LLMs work. Let’s assume for a second that there are no more links on the page. Everything is just the AI answer. The LLMs, ChatGPT isn’t looking at you like Google’s looking at you. Google’s looking at you, your page, the rest of your pages to make sure that they’re all quality. So not sending the user to a bad website, which has one great page, but a decent site overall. Chat GPT is like a much more fanned out, wider lens kind of angle on the Internet. And how does the Internet understand you? Which comes much more valuable, much more valuable what other people are saying about you than what you’re saying about yourself. I’ll give you an actual case. First off, that was always Google’s main thing in the algorithm. Their whole difference way back in the day was, you know, Yahoo, Alta Vista, all those Ash Jeeves. The reason what made Google better was Google was looking at links and was looking at links like a vote of confidence. If somebody is linking to this website, it must be they like this website. So it was always more important what other people said than what you were saying yourself. What happens in LLM land is, if it’s just me talking about myself and I’ve seen cases like this, so if I ask whatever LLM, AI mode or ChatGPT, a really niche question about my brand, it’ll pull up what I have on my website and it’ll source me as the source. That’s not what you want. You want other people seeing you as the source and writing about you, because when they broaden out a little bit, let’s take this podcast. If I, on your website, have, you know, JUST Branding Podcast, all the information about it. And if I went to ChatGPT and said, tell me everything I need to know about JUST Branding. So, Google, Google, well, Google possibly be using AI mode or whatever, would source your website and would show you everything about it. But then if I zoomed out and said, what are the best branding podcasts? What you wrote on your website is now not nearly as important as what everybody else is running on their websites about you. And I think that’s where SEOs are having a hard time, because it doesn’t become the website anymore. On that note, right, folks, please just, you know, jump on your websites and say something nice about JUST Branding, just putting it out there and that would be helpful. But no, no, absolutely fascinating. I like that idea of like a wider lens, like it’s going to become, I guess what we’re saying here, and I think this was always the case with Google, like and search just generally for brands. It’s stopping you faking stuff, isn’t it? It’s top, you know, everyone’s trying to play the game. And this was my impression of SEO, like, you know, over the last 20, 30 years as it came online. And it was like, oh, the meta tags, keyword searches. You know, it was all very technical, but why were we doing it? We were doing it to play the game, to play the algorithm, to get ourselves higher up in the rankings. And as you say, Mordy, like that’s completely changing. And I know, you know, I actually wanted to kind of ask you, Jacob, something about that, because I know over the years, you really did play that game, if I can call it that, really, really well. You’re probably one of the best kind of SEO experts that I look to, you know, in our space, in the branding space. In fact, a little quick, tiny segue here, a little story. So many people won’t know this. Shall I tell this story, Jacob? Yeah, go for it. I’m telling it real quick. So I used to run an agency, okay? And this is maybe going back 20 years, right? A creative agency. And we used to, I used to have someone on my team and they used to look at search engine rankings of our company’s kind of rankings. And so for example, we’re looking at phrases like graphic design, you know, that brand identity design, that kind of stuff. And we had like a selection of 20, 30 hit, hit, you know, key phrases we wanted to rank for globally. And I used to keep going into these meetings every month as the founder and director of the business. And we kept getting knocked off. We were number one for ages on some of these phrases. We kept getting knocked off, kept getting knocked off. And the same kind of website kept knocking us off. And that website was JUST Branding, not JUST Branding, JUST Creative. So I used to like, and I’m like, who is this JUST Creative? So I used to, I found it’s this Jacob Cass, absolutely hate his guts, like keeps knocking me off, keeps knocking me off. And then eventually I sold that business and moved on and reached out. I was reaching out to people who I admired and, you know, I reached out to Jacob and he was so generous to kind of start a conversation. And that eventually led to this podcast starting. So just a little little side side there. Jacob, I know you were very successful and then, you know, things changed. So I wondered if you could kind of put a highlight on it. Mordy, so just for context here, a couple of years ago, we probably peaked at about a million page views a month for our design blog called JUST Creative. And we’re running an affiliate model. And also we had a lot of articles for designers and creatives focused on logos, branding. But we also had a segment focused on, you know, best laptops for designers. And it was like listicle articles. And it was very heavily focused on affiliate revenue through partners like Amazon and Vado and creative marketplaces. So we scaled that. I had a team of about 10 people. It was like hockey stick growth for a number of years. And then it all came crashing down, lost like 95% of the traffic. We tried to rectify it, but the game just totally changed. Google pushing up or removing affiliate-driven sites, pushing folks like Reddit and even LinkedIn and community forums that are being buried on the internet up number one. And like we just got pushed back to pages like far below. Oh man. That’s rough by the way. It was rough. Yeah, I’m feeling like the pain. That’s so hard. Yeah, so I wasn’t the only one, but that kind of pivoted me into, well, not forced me into a corner, but it made me pivot to other things, right? Because that was a big passive income stream and it’s where a lot of my client leads came from. It was all organic. I didn’t have to do outreach or anything. So I’ve got to mention that. Yes, we had the blog, but it was also a lead pipeline for my whole business. So things just had to change and we moved to social and so forth. That’s what’s hard about it though, because it does like when organic performs, organic is great. It’s slow, it’s steady, it’s consistent. You don’t have to do much. It’s there and it’s there and it’s doing its thing, but you really are at the mercy. So Google, for context, Google had this thing called the product review update, which eventually became the review update. Google went to war. Google went to war with affiliate marketers. Yep, we lost. Everyone lost but Google. Just trying to fight town hall or city hall. You don’t win. Yeah. We fought it for a couple of years and you had some little uptakes and we were back. And then another update comes in like, damn it, we’re down again. So yeah. But yeah, it was a good experience but things have changed. Things are changing and I think what it is is, as I say, you can’t play the system anymore, can you? And it’s a tough one. So with that in mind, I have a question, Mordy. Top tips. You’ve sort of given a few, but if you were to keep it tight, right? I’m a brand builder, I’m in marketing, I’m working with my company. Like, what would you suggest in this new world of perplexity, chat, GTP, Google AI? Like, what should we be focusing on just broadly? Can I give you a real example? I hope they’re not listening. Maybe they are listening. So Wix announced something called Wixel, which I thought was like, it was going to be something else. I remember this product they were building and I was still there. And then I saw, I’m like, no, this is not that. It’s a Canva competitor. I’m like, no, that’s not, you should not be doing that now. What you should be doing is Wix is great. Like my, I’m not saying, like I work, because I don’t work there anymore. I’m saying, because it’s a really good platform and I have my website built on it. Wix is great at being Wix, so be Wix. Stop trying to expand out and I, my whole thing is we’re fine down better into who you are and what you do and do that better. And now, when you do that as a net outcome of that, you start building up cache, right? Like all these things, LLMs, search engines, they’re just, they’re just digital moths. And whoever has the strongest, greatest, best presence possible on the, what they’re going to be attracted to. If you’re spreading your wings all over the place, they can’t figure out, what the hell are you? Are you a website builder? You can have a competitor? Like, what, what, what are you? What are you about? It’s going to be way harder, way harder to get an LM to figure you out. Yeah. It’s gonna be hard for Google. Yeah. The problem with that is, especially in a larger organization, is the internal comps part, is getting everybody on that same page. I always have this thing that SEO should really exist under comps. It doesn’t. SEO exists under performance, and performance kind of does its own thing. And people don’t realize, it’s really, I call my thing Unify. Performance teams don’t talk to brand teams. Those don’t. You’ll have a brand team build out in an LP, and the performance team, the SEO team will manage the blog, and they can be talking about the same product in two completely different ways. And that doesn’t work right now. Everyone needs to be on the same page. There has to be strong identity. When I say like, oh, it’s great, like, you know, the fact that the Internet is constricting, I think that’s a good thing. I think a lot of the content people are creating, what you were saying before, it wasn’t there to help users. It was there so I could rank for a keyword. It was there so I can get traffic. It wasn’t really there to help people. So, the fact that we’re in an era of refinement, I think is a good thing for the user. I mean, not a good thing for digital marketers, but if you will like, in marketing, I feel like there’s always like a motion. It’s very philosophical, like I’m trying to get into Aristodilian like emotions of the world, but there’s always motion. The motion like for the last 10 years is expand, cast a Y net, get more. I think the motion that we’re in now is refinement. AI is going to help you refine what you’re looking for, to help you refine what’s out there, to help you get something that’s more refined and personal to what you’re looking for. And if marketers can get refined and aligned, I think you’re so far ahead of the game. Because people naturally don’t want to refine, they want to expand, and teams have a very hard time seeking up in a real way. So, Mordy, what’s that look like in reality when you say refined, like as a brand or a product? It would be instead of Wix going out, like creating a Wixel as a competitor to Canva, I was saying like, whatever, Canva’s got what it’s got. What do we do to, like, who are we as a website builder? What are we actually really all about? Because I think it’s like, I know it’s not like a silly question, but brands don’t do that enough, I feel like. And when they do do it, it’s usually not with enough depth, and they get distracted. It’s like, why do I see all these companies going after AI this and AI that? In my opinion, it’s just my take. It’s because these companies never really have strong brand identity to begin with. They didn’t really know who they were, and they didn’t know, wait a second, like, that’s not who we are. We have to not stray off. Yeah, we should get into AI, but what’s within our wheelhouse? What’s not within our wheelhouse? And companies getting back on that and figuring, okay, who we are, how do we double down on that? How do we make that better? How do we create services that maybe they’re different services, but they still support that same idea? I remember when I was back at a company called Rank Ranger, they got an SEO rank tracking team. They got about a similar web a couple of years ago. They were dev teams, and dev teams do this, by the way, if you’re listening. They were just building for the sake of building. Google does it all the time. And instead of building a product with a roadmap where one thing built on the other thing that help you create product identity, they were just kind of all over the place. And it worked back then because the internet was so, the industry there was so big, it was fine. I wouldn’t do it like now. Everything needs to be strategic to build up that identity of who you are and what you’re about so that you stand out and that you’re remembered. Can I ask another question, Mordy? So, what do you think about brands investing in… You know, we talked about Google being a middle man, right? Or middle person, you know, a middle being, entity. And therefore, we can’t control it, right? And you talked at the start about, you know, it’s evolving itself, and it probably doesn’t quite know how it’s going to end up just yet either. So, there’s a lot of unknowns if we focused on trying to show up in AI and so on. But what about the flip side of that, which is stuff that we can control? So, what do you think about brands focusing on the stuff that they own, their channels like their email, community building, that kind of stuff? Do you think that that is of value to brands? Yeah, I think it’s all of value to brands. I think it’s what’s valuable to brands. And again, I feel like with this kind of question, there’s so many different… This is my perspective on it. I don’t like how I’m like, this is the perspective, this is my outlook, my perspective on this. If I worked at MailChimp, I would probably say the opposite of this. Yeah, I think email is great. And I think the problem with things like email is, okay, yeah, so I have them, I own the audience. You know, never own your audience. This is a weird way of thinking. But how do you get the email list? Like, there’s like an email list fairy, boop, they have an email list. I think everything always comes back to understanding, again, building up that momentum based on who you are. And you can use, by the way, like, I’ll give you a good example of this, where you can use the LLMs to figure that out. Like, where in my industry is there a ton of skepticism and hesitancy to consume, like to buy the product or the service, that no one else is talking about? And Gatorade is a good example of this. Turns out when you ask LLMs if Gatorade is good or not, like, what should I know about Gatorade? It tells you, yeah, it’s like, yeah, great if you have like a really great workout, but it’s got a ton of sugar in it. And then if you ask Gatorade, which is better? Drinking Gatorade or drinking vitamin water? It’ll say after an intense workout Gatorade, but for most other cases, drink vitamin water. Guess how many times? And that’s a real thing. The LLM is a proxy of the web. And that’s gonna be one of the things to realize. Sometimes AAAA, non-alcoholics anonymous, nor the American Automotive Association. Sometimes AI and LLMs hallucinate, but sometimes they’re actually just serving as a representative of the entire web. They’re saying and summarizing what the web is saying about Gatorade in this case. And if you could pull out Gems, like, huh, when I asked the same thing about Powerade and all the other competitors, this thing about the health thing keeps coming up. But no one, guess how many times Gatorade mentions the word health on their website? Did you say zero? Zero. Zero times. Vitamin water also, zero times. They say that you shouldn’t drink it because it’s from New York. I’m like, I’m from New York and the East River is disgusting. If I was a website in that health drink space, I would use AI and I would use LMS to realize like, wait a second, there’s a brand gap here that we can totally capitalize on and talk about. So it’s less about, do I get into the AI? Do I build on my email list now? What do I do on social? It’s about getting ahead of the things that actually relate to your user concerns and pain points and skepticism and actually getting ahead of and talking about it. And now you want to talk about what’s the best way to distribute that? Is that through email? Is it through running a blog post? Is it if I saw one, it was, I asked AI who makes seatbelts? Random, I know, but it listed a bunch of companies. And then it had other no issues in Google’s AI mode, other notable company and elicited another company. Other notable company is like me asking you like, hey, do you want to go out? And you saying when hell freezes over and then me saying, so you’re saying there’s a chance. Other notable company, like I already saw 10 notable companies. I don’t want the other notable company. If I was that company, I would even start online. I would start like networking in Washington, DC and getting in front of Congress to testify about all the data I have about seatbelt studies and seatbelt safety and using that to create momentum and then case studies and whatever online. So yeah, email is great, communities are great, social is great, search could be great. But unless you have that real brand foundation there to begin with, none of it matters. Nice. So we’re starting to come to the end now, and I just wanted to ask you a couple of other quick questions about the future, a way you’ve hinted at this. But imagine we’re fast forwarding, that’s better, three years’ time, right? What, you know, some of these things have been resolved. What does success look like for brands online? Like, how do we actually imagine the future to be? I mean, we’ve got Alexa, we’ve got Voice, you know, we’ve not even got Clicks anymore, you know, coming into the picture. Like, what does this start looking like in your view? I mean, three years from now, success for me looks like I haven’t lost all my hair. You and me both, man. Yeah, I’m just like telling you straight up. I think it looks like direct traffic, which people, it’s funny because like SEO performance, people always crapped on direct traffic the most, because it is, analytically speaking, a black hole. Anything that’s not, you know, attributed to Google, attributed to social, attributed to a source, just ends up in direct. But to me, direct is also brand traffic, right? Where, like, where was it? Cheers, like, you want to go where everybody knows your name, right? No one ever said you want to go chasing people around the internet like a chicken with your head cut off screaming your name. That’s not the end goal. The end goal is to have people come to you to be a destination. So it’s leveraging all of these things. It’s leveraging people, oh, there’s no more clicks. There’s no more, for them, it clicks for a long time in a lot of things, like Google weather in New York City, Google Yankee score. There hasn’t been a click in, I don’t know, 10 years. So it’s not a new thing. What I think success looks like is I go and I’m like, all right, where’s a great place to get notepads? I need new notepads, by the way. Like I’m too cheap to buy the good ones. I’m waiting to go to the next conference to go to the vendors and steal the good ones, which is sad, it’s pathetic, but it’s my thing. Where do I get a good note? But which conference has the best vendors that offer the best notepads? That’s the conference I want to go to. And I see a thing in the LLM, and I see a thing here, and I see a thing on social, and then eventually, you know what? I keep seeing, you know, I don’t know, like whatever conference, Bob’s conference show up. They’re the ones with the best notepads for free. All right, so let me Google Bob’s notepads. And Rand Fishkin, if you know, if you’re listening, who Rand Fishkin is, but Rand is an amazing marketer. He has originally started one of the SEO companies a long time ago. And he talks about how everyone attributes traffic to Google, because Google is the greatest source of traffic. But that doesn’t mean that’s where it started. You could have saw me on social, Googled me, found my website, went to my website. That traffic analytically gets attributed to Google, but it’s not really Google traffic, is it? Success in the future looks something like that, because the funnel is messy. It’s always been messy. I argue that really, is it a funnel to a certain extent? I think that’s a whole myth. But people see you, they know what you’re about. You have a certain level of identity distinction and they’re coming to look for you. They’re typing your website’s name, forget Google, directly into the browser and going to your website. So to summarize, we should be focusing on being known, right? Not just being found, right? Like work on the basics, work on adding real value out there so that people are talking about you. That wider lens becomes more authentic and true and then we’ll find success, which is what in terms of brand building, brand strategy, the long-term game we’ve always been advocating for as brand builders. But it’s so tough to do, isn’t it? So it’s going to take a bit of readjustment and movement. I want to thank you so much, Mordy, for coming on the show. It’s been really exciting and enlightening. Jacob, anything last from yourself or any final questions from you? I think there was one little question here. If you had one message for brand builders today, what would it be? One message for brand builders today, identity is everything. It’s everything. It will get you so off course if you don’t have it. And if you haven’t tapped into it in a meaningful way, the problems that you’re going to end up with are, you’re going to end up chasing whatever iteration of Google’s AI, whatever is out there. And there will be iteration after iteration after iteration. You won’t have the ability. I hate the Wayne Greskey analogy, like skate towards the puck. You won’t have the ability to do that. Also, I don’t know if Wayne Greskey actually said that or not. I don’t know. Then ask me. All right. Brilliant. And just to wrap up, where can people connect with you? Tiktok. No, I don’t have a Tiktok account. I don’t fall downstairs and I don’t sing or dance. So, LinkedIn. You can find me on LinkedIn, on my website, univitebrandmarketing.com. I’m kind of on Twitter, but not as much as I used to be. Amazing. Well, thank you so much for coming on, Mordy. You’ve been brilliant. The audience have been listening and we want to thank everybody for tuning in as well. We’re ever so grateful.

The company is rolling out a hybrid index called “Mag 7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,” and it will track “Magnificent 7” stocks, Coinbase’s own shares, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, according to a blog post. Each of the index’s components are weighted equally, meaning a change in Bitcoin’s price will have a similar effect on the index as a change in the price of Nvidia’s shares. In addition to the chipmaker, the index tracks Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla shares. The index uses BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust ETFs for tracking the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Both products debuted in the U.S. last year, and they have generated billions of dollars of inflows. The company plans on sharing more details about trading the index on “partner platforms,” suggesting that the product won’t be available through Coinbase’s app initially. The index is set to launch on September 22. Decrypt reached out to Coinbase for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Coinbase shares were little changed on Monday at $304.40, according to Yahoo Finance. The San Francisco-based firm’s stock price has rallied 22% year-to-date. This year, Coinbase has leaned into its derivatives arm as an area of growth. In May, Coinbase unveiled a $2.9 billion deal to acquire the options exchange Deribit. It is fairly commonplace for crypto exchanges to offer futures outside the U.S., but amid tension between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the practice has been mired in regulatory uncertainty for years. Crypto exchange Kraken debuted U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives in mid-July. At the time, it said “commodity, fixed income, FX and equity futures” were coming, in a blog post. In March, Kraken said it would buy NinjaTrader, a futures broker, for $1.5 billion. Prediction markets have also been buying firms that offer derivatives in the U.S., such as Polymarket. Last month, the firm said it was purchasing derivatives exchange QCX for $112 million, describing it as a key move for returning to U.S. markets.

The index tracks the seven largest US technology companies, Coinbase's own stock, and BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase will launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure, according to a Sept. 2 announcement. The product will debut on Sept. 22, arriving less than two months after Coinbase began offering CFTC-regulated perpetuals to US customers in July. The hybrid index tracks 10 equally weighted components: the seven largest US technology companies, known as the “Magnificent Seven,” Coinbase’s own stock, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Each component represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weightings. The Magnificent Seven stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. The cryptocurrency exposure is provided through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), offering indirect access to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. Coinbase positions the product as addressing investor demand for dual exposure to traditional financial instruments and digital assets. The company stated that no US-listed derivative previously offered access to both equities and cryptocurrencies within a futures product. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via The monthly cash-settled contracts represent $1 multiplied by the index value. At an example index price of $3,000, each contract would carry a notional value of $3,000. MarketVector serves as the official index provider for calculation and maintenance. The launch builds on Coinbase’s derivatives expansion following its July introduction of CFTC-regulated perpetual contracts for US customers. Those products offer up to 10x leverage with 0.02% fees on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coinbase frames the equity index futures as marking “the next evolution of our product suite” and paving the way for multi-asset derivatives that broaden access and efficiency for investors. The company promises to expand availability to retail users in the coming months after the initial launch through partner platforms.

Title: WLFI Slides 15% After Launch As Trump Token Team Eyes Burn Strategy

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. World Liberty Financial’s Trump-linked WLFI token plunged in price after a high-profile debut, prompting its backers to propose an aggressive buyback-and-burn plan to steady the market. According to trading data and market reports, the token briefly traded above $0.30 at launch before falling as much as 15%–30% and settling around $0.21–$0.24 in the hours that followed. Based on reports, the sharp drop followed a large token unlock that added roughly 25 billion WLFI to circulating supply, a move that instantly inflated the paper value of the Trump family’s holdings. That unlock pushed the family’s stake into the billions on paper—various outlets put the tally near $5 billion to $6+ billion depending on the price used. Trading venues including Binance, OKX and Bybit handled early volume, and roughly $1 billion changed hands in the first hour on some platforms, according to coverage of the debut. Reports say early investors were allowed to sell a portion of their holdings, which likely amplified selling pressure as markets digested the newly tradable tokens. In response, World Liberty Financial’s community and team floated a buyback-and-burn program that would route 100% of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) fees from chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain and Solana toward repurchasing WLFI on open markets and permanently burning those tokens. The aim, according to proponents, is to reduce circulating supply and support longer-term holders. Critics warn that burns funded by fees may take years to materially reduce the massive unlocked supply. Analysts and commentators pointed out a mismatch between headline valuations and the practical reality of supply dynamics. Depending on which price is used, WLFI’s market cap was reported across a wide band—some outlets published peak valuations in the billions, even as price swings kept the effective market cap volatile throughout the day. Reports disclose that the project’s ties to US President Donald Trump and his family have drawn extra scrutiny. Observers say that when political figures hold large token positions, questions about conflicts of interest and regulatory oversight tend to rise faster than normal market noise. World Liberty insists the project is a private venture with governance rules, but regulators and critics have said they will be watching closely. Market participants are now watching vote outcomes and governance updates closely. If the fee-to-burn plan is approved and implemented, it will be measured by how much protocol revenue it can divert into buybacks and how quickly those repurchases can reduce supply.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-nvidia-earnings-could-mean-for-broadcom-and-other-chipmakers-11800514
Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:02:49Z
Full Content:
As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating. CORRECTION—Sept. 2, 2025: This article has been corrected to reflect the U.S. was not represented at the summit in Tianjin and President Trump did not attend.

Title: This 7.2% Payer Is The Cheapest Fund You Don’t Already Own

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Large cap stocks have been crushing small caps in the last few years. That’s, well, unusual, to say the least. And it’s set us up for cheap 7.2% dividends (with upside) from closed end funds. Small caps, of course, aren’t known for big dividends. The benchmark ETF for them, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) only pays 1.1%. But stick with me for a moment and I’ll show you how we’re going to pull this off. Around the time of the pandemic, small caps started lagging the S&P 500 after years of tracking it. Since then, the gap has widened. But there are signs a shift is in the works. “Investors Look to S&P’s Forgotten 493 Stocks as Megacap Tech Wobbles” reads a recent headline from the Financial Times. While perhaps a bit premature, the article does signal a new pivot. Simply put, Big Tech, which dominates large caps and includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT), has been soaring for a couple of years, drawing attention away from the rest of the market. If we look at the concentration of the S&P 500—that is, the percentage of the index comprised of the 10 largest firms—we see a stunning trend. Going by this chart, the 10 biggest S&P 500 firms make up a quarter of the index’s earnings and 40% of its market cap. In other words, Big Tech has been getting pricier and pricier in relation to the rest of the market since 2022. That’s obviously unsustainable in the long run, and it could prompt investors to look for alternatives to the Apples and Alphabets of the world. As they do, small caps are likely to garner more attention, closing the gap with large caps. That would mean years of outperformance for these companies. This Small Cap ETF Is Okay … If this happens, expect IWM to start beating S&P 500 index funds. That outperformance could then reinforce itself as more investors buy, rewarding those who got in early. There’s just one problem with IWM: that 1.1% yield. Lucky for us, there is a small-cap focused closed-end fund (CEF) paying a lot more. It’s been quietly crushing IWM, too. That would be the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT), which focuses on smaller companies with promising cash flow growth. In purple above, we see RVT’s total net asset value (NAV) return, which shows the performance of its underlying portfolio so far this year, including dividends. While many investors haven’t heard of RVT holdings such as IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) or SEI Investments (SEIC), these stocks have helped the fund not just profit but outperform. With a near-10% NAV return, RVT is far ahead of the small-cap index’s 6.6%. That means RVT is generating “alpha”: earning more than the index it tracks. At the same time, the CEF’s total market price return is up 5.8%, so investors aren’t bidding up the shares as much as its fundamentals warrant. The result is this chart: RVT’s discount to NAV, which measures the difference between NAV and the fund’s price on the open market, has been widening in 2025 and recently hit double digits for the first time in a year. That’s simply too big of a markdown. This kind of thing happens with CEFs all the time. Often what follows is that investors rush in to fix the mispricing, resulting in capital gains on top of the fund’s income stream. Speaking of income, while IWM yields 1.1%, RVT pays that 7.2% I mentioned earlier. That’s because, like most CEFs, RVT pays out as much of its profits as possible as dividends. This makes the fund and attractive way to invest in small caps, a notoriously volatile asset class. Getting part of our profits as dividends reduces our exposure to that volatility and gives us an income stream we can use however we like. We could even pair RVT with a CEF holding different assets, using the income from one fund to buy the other when it’s oversold, and doing the reverse when it’s overbought. This is the kind of strategy we use in our CEF Insider service, as it helps us secure a large income stream and position ourselves for gains without being overexposed to one part of the market.

Title: No Fireworks, Just Grind: Bitcoin Could Drift To $1M Over 7 Years: Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to pseudonymous Bitcoin analyst PlanC, the road to $1,000,000 per coin might look a lot less pronounced than many expect. PlanC floated the idea that, instead of sharp parabolic runs, Bitcoin could “slow-grind” higher — inching upward over the next seven years and quietly reaching $1 million by 2032. What if the earlier “Bitcoin cycles” were nothing more than the product of a retail-dominated, FOMO-fueled market? What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations? And every time we… — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) August 31, 2025 PlanC argues that long stretches of sideways trading tend to fool people into thinking the cycle has ended and that crashes of up to 80% are coming. He suggested those deep wipeouts haven’t played out every time prices pause. Instead, he envisions recurring, drawn-out consolidations and corrections of roughly 10–30% — messy but manageable — that add up to steady gains rather than headline-grabbing rallies. Not everyone agrees. Jan3 founder Samson Mow has painted a very different picture. According to reports, Mow predicted an “omega candle” that could lift Bitcoin by $100,000 in a single day. $1M #BITCOIN ISN’T THAT MUCH GIVEN ALL THE MONETARY MONKEY BUSINESS GOING ON FOR THE LAST FEW DECADES pic.twitter.com/MzZZXi0mtD — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 1, 2024 He told Magazine in June that $1,000,000 is “a given,” and he suggested the milestone could come this year or next. That view leans on the idea that sudden, extreme demand imbalances can still trigger explosive moves. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries are central to the debate. According to reports, several high-profile figures now predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million. Tom Lee has suggested it could hit that kind of figure or even $3,000,000 long term, while Michael Saylor has put $1 million on the table by 2035. Tom Lee says Bitcoin will experience a supply shock, and the $BTC price will reach $3,000,000. Do you agree with Tom Lee? Could Bitcoin experience a supply shock? Perhaps we can add $LUNC to this list.#Bitcoin #BTC #Bullish #TomLee pic.twitter.com/rhHT1yFXTj — TerraNewsEN (@TerraNewsEN) August 24, 2025 Asset managers have joined the chorus. Bitwise forecasts $1.3 million by 2035, pointing to rising US debt and a weaker dollar as drivers. Other voices include Robert Kiyosaki, who sees $1 million by 2030, and Cantor Fitzgerald analysts who also back the milestone. Timelines differ, but institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term case is clearly growing. Meanwhile, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal warned that many treasury buyers use credit, and if credit spreads widen or risk measures spike, “strong hands” could be forced sellers. Market structure can change quickly when liquidity thins or macro stress appears. Reports have disclosed that institutional flows create a base of demand, but they don’t remove traditional market pressures. Some industry figures view a rapid ascent as a red flag. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said on Aug. 17 that a million-dollar Bitcoin next year would likely mean the US economy was in serious trouble. Stories and lessons from a decade in crypto with Mike @Novogratz. We talk about $GLXY, the 80,000 bitcoin transaction, whether Mike has any investing regrets, maxis and altcoin communities, Bitcoin’s roadmap to $1 million and much more. Timecodes: 00:00 Meet Mike Novogratz:… pic.twitter.com/4HrOi1juE5 — Natalie Brunell ⚡️ (@natbrunell) August 12, 2025 In his view, extreme price moves tied to fear or systemic stress would not be a healthy signal for either markets or the broader economy. For now, the outlook splits between a blockbuster surge and a quiet climb. Whether Bitcoin delivers an omega candle or inches its way higher, the possibility of reaching $1,000,000 remains central to the debate. If PlanC is right, there may be no fireworks at all—just a steady grind that takes the coin to its milestone over the next seven years.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Asia’s richest tycoon has summoned all hands on deck to help him steer his $250 billion empire through the biggest geopolitical storm of its five decades as a public company. Friends and family answered Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s call. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Walt Disney and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund showed up at Reliance Industries Ltd’s virtual annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday, together with he himself, his wife and three children. The 68-year-old patriarch, whose processing of discounted Russian oil seems at the heart of fraying US-India ties, needs all the support he can get. US President Donald Trump has sanctioned the most-populous nation with exorbitant 50% tariffs, allegedly for feeding Russia’s war machine. US officials have not directly accused Ambani. But when White House trade advisor Peter Navarro made a bizarre reference to the Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war," he puts the largest single buyer of Russian oil in India in a pickle. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Why imports of American gas by Reliance make all-round strategic sense “I assure our respected prime minister that Reliance will follow his command with redoubled efforts," Ambani said at the AGM. That show of solidarity with Modi’s call for self-reliance is along expected lines. To say anything else may mean losing political influence. At the same time, though, Ambani can’t afford to annoy the US, which his conglomerate needs more than ever for capital and technology to break into the big league: $1 trillion-plus market valuation. A strategy to weather the squall began to emerge at the annual shareholder meeting last week. Ambani’s older son, Akash, has been tasked with delivering a mega IPO of the group’s digital services business, the world’s largest data firm with 500 million customers. During the pandemic, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech titans who pumped $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd. An IPO by June would strengthen the case for their further entanglement. Both made cameo appearances at the Friday event to back Ambani’s upcoming investments in AI. Google will provide cloud infrastructure, while a $100 million joint venture with Meta will develop AI solutions for local enterprises. Also Read: Transformer by Mint | Can Mukesh Ambani pull off a ‘Jio moment’ for AI? The Saudi wealth fund is an investor in both Jio and Reliance Retail. The biggest Indian retailer is not yet IPO-ready, but Isha Ambani, Akash’s twin sister, is building a consumer goods company that will eventually make the stuff that sells on Reliance’s shopping network. That’s where the media partnership with Disney, with 300 million paid subscribers and a near-complete lock on cricket, would come in handy as an advertising vehicle. Disney boss Bob Iger, too, sent in a video message for Reliance shareholders. However, the media business won’t be just about entertainment and commerce. New Delhi has long yearned for its own version of Qatar’s Al Jazeera, a tool to influence global opinion and signal India’s rise. Ambani is promising to step in to fulfil that ambition with news bureaus in major world capitals. This, too, is a message of support to New Delhi, which needs to find its way back into Washington’s strategic orbit even as it normalizes ties with Beijing. It’s also a timely move from a competitive standpoint. The rival Adani group’s legal troubles in the US are making it hard for it to beef up its international clout.

It won’t be easy to replicate a refinery operation that has churned out billions. The question is if the 30-year-old, who came to the AGM podium for the first time on Friday, can execute such an audacious pivot. The Adani Group, which has similar plans, will put up a tough fight. Here, the friends who attended any part of Anant Ambani’s wedding celebration last year might prove helpful. Among them is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi fund and a Reliance board member, is also the chairman of Saudi Aramco. The state-run oil producer had come close to investing in Reliance’s refinery in 2019. The deal fell apart two years later. Why not put it back on the table? A changed geopolitical landscape and the Saudis’ proximity to the Trump administration may offer a chance to direct Reliance away from Russian oil and towards West Asian crude and US gas, particularly ethane. A lacklustre stock price suggests that investors are sceptical of Ambani’s pledge to transform Reliance into a “deep-tech company."

That show of solidarity with Modi’s call for self-reliance is along expected lines. To say anything else may mean losing political influence. At the same time, though, Ambani can’t afford to annoy the US, which his conglomerate needs more than ever for capital and technology to break into the big league: $1 trillion-plus market valuation. A strategy to weather the squall began to emerge at the annual shareholder meeting last week. Ambani’s older son, Akash, has been tasked with delivering a mega IPO of the group’s digital services business, the world’s largest data firm with 500 million customers. During the pandemic, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech titans who pumped $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd. An IPO by June would strengthen the case for their further entanglement. Both made cameo appearances at the Friday event to back Ambani’s upcoming investments in AI. Google will provide cloud infrastructure, while a $100 million joint venture with Meta will develop AI solutions for local enterprises.

The Campaign Podcast discusses how agencies are being affected by the increasing AI capabilities of media platforms and whether their role is under threat. Media companies including Meta, TikTok, X, Spotify, Pinterest and others have been advancing their AI capabilities to improve the process of creating and serving ads on their platforms. So where does this leave media and creative agencies? Meta has gone so far as to call itself a “one-stop shop” for advertisers, aiming to fully automate advertising, including the creation and targeting of ads, by the end of the year. After this was reported, Meta’s stock price went up, while those of Publicis, Omnicom, IPG and WPP all took a dip. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: “Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we’re going to go do the rest for them.” In this episode of The Campaign Podcast, Campaign's editorial team discusses the threat posed by media platforms’ advancement of AI and how agencies are adapting to maintain their role in the advertising process. Hosted by Campaign's tech editor, Lucy Shelley, the episode features deputy media editor Shauna Lewis and UK editor Maisie McCabe.

September 02, 2025 00:52 ET | Source: Canyon Resources Limited Canyon Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HIGHLIGHTS Ore Reserves Estimate Upgrade Production – Staged development to reduce initial capital Economics1 Infrastructure Investor Webinar/ Conference Call Canyon Chief Executive Officer Peter Secker commented: “The compelling Definitive Feasibility Study outcome and Ore Reserves Upgrade will add to the significant momentum Canyon has achieved at Minim Martap. “We have a world-class bauxite Project on any measure, with scale, a quality resource, and a highly supportive jurisdiction backing a Project that represents a major economic opportunity for Cameroon. “With a project NPV of US$835M and IRR of 29%, in combination with a high grade 51% Al2O3 Ore Reserve places our product at the premium end of the market. “Our staged approach to the development, along with its highly competitive 1st Stage US$96M CAPEX, efficient mining process and US$140M debt financing in place, makes Minim Martap a compelling opportunity for our investors, and we look forward to taking them on an exciting journey with us through the Project’s execution and into production in H1, 2026.” A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on this link. ASX Chapter 5 Compliance and Cautionary Statement The production targets referred to in this announcement are 100% based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves estimated at the Project. The current Proved and Probable Ore Reserves utilises 144.0Mt over the 20-year mining plan, which represents a portion of 30% of current global Measured category Mineral Resources estimated at the Project. None of the Inferred category Mineral Resources underpin the production target. It is noted that there is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources. There is no certainty that further exploration work will result in upgrading the Inferred Resources to Indicated status or that the production target itself will be realised. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimate have been prepared by Competent Persons, with Competent Persons Statements in Appendix 1. The DFS developed engineering designs to provide costs at a +/- 15% level of accuracy. The Company has concluded that it has a reasonable basis for providing the production targets, forecast financial information and other forward-looking statements included in this announcement. The detailed reasons for that conclusion are outlined throughout this announcement and all material assumptions, including JORC modifying factors (Appendix 3, JORC Table 1, Section 4) upon which the forecast financial information is based, are disclosed in this announcement. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 and the ASX Listing Rules. All material assumptions relating to production targets and financial forecasts are detailed in this report and the Ore Reserve Statement in Appendix 2 on page 47. Refer also to the further disclaimers and cautionary statements included before the Appendices to this announcement. Leading bauxite developer Canyon Resources Limited (ACN 140 087 261) (ASX: CAY) (‘Canyon’ or the ‘Company’) has released the updated Definitive Feasibility Study (‘DFS’) for the Company’s flagship Minim Martap Bauxite Project (‘Minim Martap’ or ‘the Project’), which confirms the Project’s strong economics and outlines a pathway for the phased development of what is planned to be a major new bauxite producer. The release of the DFS coincides with an updated Mineral Resource and results of an Ore Reserve Update for the Project. The Ore Reserve estimate has been increased by one third to 144Mt of DSO grade ore at 51.2% Al2O3 and 1.7% SiO2, and which will underpin the long-term future of Minim Martap. Located in Cameroon, Minim Martap will be executed as a capital-efficient, staged development by Canyon, with first ore production planned for Q1 CY2026 and first shipment to take place in 1H CY2026. Canyon has commenced early works for the Project, including the construction of the Inland Rail Facility (IRF) that will be used to transfer ore from road to rail, the upgrade of the haul road to transfer ore to the IRF and the procurement of long lead items such as locomotives for rail haul. The Company’s recently announced funding in the form of debt from AFG Bank Cameroon (AFG) (~US$140M), and equity from an options exercise by Eagle Eye Asset Holdings Pte Ltd (EEA) (A$25.4M) will fund long lead items and the Project’s Stage 1 CAPEX of US$96M. RESOURCE AND RESERVE UPGRADE The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit, adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK is presented below in Table 1. Pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 5.9.1, the Company provides the following summary in relation to Appendix 3 attached to this announcement. MATERIAL DFS OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS Economics Minim Martap has exceptional economics, based on its low CAPEX requirements, and efficient mining and logistics that are forecast at US$35/wmt. These factors combine to provide the Project with a pre-tax NPV of US$835M and an IRR of 29%. Figure 2 within the accompanying Media Snippet details the Project’s annual cashflows in real terms. Production Target The current 20-year mine plan and production schedule is based solely on the Proved Ore Reserve (JORC Code, 2012). The Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Proved and Probable Ore Reserves as a source of DSO material. Minim Martap can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of DSO product. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product. SiO2 is maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. Annual bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented in Table 3. The bauxite recovered from the surface mining process does not require any additional processing. The surface miner crushes the ore to the required size as a part of the mining process and this ore is then exported as DSO. Mining method selected and other mining assumptions The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit is the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 4: Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; resulting in the application of a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, a 0.7 m loss-only approach was applied to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. The following losses were also applied to account for operational constraints: Mine to Port Infrastructure The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises a mine camp and mine site infrastructure for Camalco personnel, a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, IRF, Doula Port development, and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for a rail upgrade and will be reimbursed for these upfront funds through offsets against royalties and / or other charges. A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, Camrail & Camalco is being set up to finalise the form and timing of this reimbursement. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 5: Funding The Company currently believes that there are reasonable grounds to assume that the Project can be financed as envisaged in this announcement, on the following basis: Environmental Approvals The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. Community The local community strongly supports Minim Martap, recognising the significant long-term economic benefits of the Project. Through the construction and operations of the Project, the Company expects to have a workforce comprised of 97 per cent local people. Along with the macroeconomic benefits of a major resources project for the Cameroon economy, Minim Martap will also contribute to the development of new economic infrastructure and improvements to existing infrastructure facilities. This includes roads adjacent to the Project area and the 800km rail link from the Company’s Inland Rail Facility to the Port of Douala. STUDY TEAM The Definitive Feasibility Study was completed by Canyon with support from specialist consultants as listed below: BAUXITE MARKET Canyon commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap mine in Cameroon. Forecast Prices for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 5. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. NEXT STEPS 2025 2026 THE MINIM MARTAP BAUXITE PROJECT DEFINITIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS 1.0 Executive Summary 1.1 Introduction Canyon Resources Limited (Canyon) is developing the Minim Martap Bauxite Project (the project) located in Central Cameroon, currently through its 100 percent owned subsidiary Camalco SA (Camalco). Following the grant of the Mining Permit for the Minim Martap mining areas, in accordance with Section 59 of the Mining Code, an entity of the State will be granted 10% ownership of the special purpose Joint Venture Company formed for that purpose, free of charge. The project is located approximately 800 km by rail, north-east of the Douala Port. The project is considered highly prospective for its high grade and low contaminant Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Bauxite. Camalco aims to produce and export approximately 10 million tons per annum (mtpa) of bauxite utilising Cameroon’s established infrastructure facilities including railway corridor and ports. 1.1.1. Project Description Minim Martap is a Greenfield Bauxite Development project, with mining operations proposed to be undertaken at three (3) plateaus namely Beatrice, Danielle and Raymonde, using surface miners targeting the production of DSO bauxite product with a grade of approximately 51% total alumina (Al2O3) and ≤2% total silica (SiO2). DSO grade mined bauxite ore shall be transported by road for an approximate distance of 42 km to the rail head at the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) located at Makor. From there, the bauxite will be transported by rail to the Port of Douala before transshipment to ocean going capsize vessels. A schematic representation of the project is presented in Figure 1-1 within the accompanying Media Snippet. The proposed project caters for the systematic extraction of Bauxite ore and its transportation, achieved by the upgrading of critical existing facilities including development of a road network from the mine to the existing rail facility 5km south of Makor, revamping of the rail network and development of port infrastructure facilities. This will have a positive impact on the Socio-Economic Development of the local inhabitants along with the generation of a significant amount of foreign exchange by selling of International standard DSO Grade Bauxite ore. For the purpose of preparation of the Detailed Feasibility Study (DFS), Camalco has appointed various agencies to conduct relevant testworks /studies, as presented below in Table 1-1. Table 1-1 - Agencies Involved for Conducting Various Studies DASTUR Engineering International GmbH in association with M. N. Dastur & Company (P) Ltd. (DASTUR) has been mandated by Camalco to integrate the DFS for this project based on the studies conducted by various agencies as mentioned in Table 1-1 above. 1.1.2. Project Location The Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of three (3) tenements referred to as Minim Martap, Makan, and Ngaoundal all located within the Vina and Djerem Departments of the Adamawa region in Central Cameroon. The proposed mining areas, defined by the strategic scheduling and pit designs, are within three (3) plateaus (Danielle, Beatrice, and Raymonde) of the Minim Martap Mining/Exploitation Permit as shown in red in Figure 1-2 within the accompanying Media Snippet. 1.1 Geology, Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Estimation 1.2.4. Geological Overview The project area is located within the Central Cameroon Shear Zone (CCSZ), which is a major northeast–southwest trending structural feature that separates the North-West Cameroon Domain to the north from the Adamawa Domain to the south. The bauxites were formed from the lateralization of the Cambrian granites. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the current landform of flat-topped plateaus separated by deeply incised valleys, with the bauxites occurring within remnant laterites on the plateau tops. The plateaus are very irregular in shape and, especially those in Minim Martap, are significantly elongated subparallel to the structural trend of the CCSZ. The plateau tops are generally quite flat, but the flanks are usually relatively steep. The laterite profile typically comprises a thin soil covering, an iron-rich capping, a leached horizon where the removal of silica and iron has resulted in the residual enrichment of bauxite minerals, and a kaolinitic basal clay horizon. Most of the bauxite Mineral Resource is contained within the leached horizon, which is typically several meters thick. The dominant mineral in the bauxite horizon is gibbsite, with an average concentration of approximately 75%. The other major minerals in order of abundance include goethite, and hematite, with lesser amounts of anatase, kaolinite, quartz, rutile. Boehmite and organic carbon concentrations are very low. 1.2.5. Mineral Resource Estimation The Mineral Resource Estimate as reported by SRK for the Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal tenements as at July 2025 is presented in Table 1-2 in the next page. The total estimated Mineral Resource considering the three (3) tenements amounts to about 1.1 Billion Metric Tonnes. The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared to a sufficient quality standard and classified in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012), and SRK considers that the classifications reasonably reflect the Competent Person’s confidence in the estimates. Based on the marketing studies commissioned by Camalco, and the mine planning work completed as part of the DFS, the following criteria have been used for resource reporting: a) Danielle, Beatrice, Raymonde, Agnes, and Alice, which Camalco has identified as the high-grade priority plateaus, have been reported using a ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grade applied to individual model cells. b) All other plateaus have been reported using ≥ 35% Al2O3 and ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grades applied to individual model cells.Table 1-2 - Mineral Resource Estimate for Minim Martap – July 2025 1.2.6. Mining and Mining Inventory The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Using appropriate ore loss and dilution factors, the three plateaus considered for mining in the 20-year life of mine plan have an initial extractable mining inventory of 199.5 Mt (Table 1-3). Table 1-3 - Total Extractable Mining Inventory for Minim Martap Deposit The inventory beyond the Ore Reserve estimate (20-year life of mine plan-LOMP) is expected to support further extraction beyond current LOMP, upon 1st renewal of mining permit. The additional mining inventory not considered in the LOMP will include ore from the eight (8) plateaus forming a part of the Minim Martap Mineral Resource. 1.2.7. Ore Reserve Estimation The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve Statement for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK, with an effective date of August 2025, is presented below as Table 1-4. Table 1-4 - Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – August 2025 The Ore Reserve Estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource Estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: a) A required direct shipping ore (DSO) grade of 51% alumina (± 1%) and <2.0% silica (± 0.5%).b) Considerations for ore loss and dilution derived from operational practicalities.c) An economic stripping ratio informed by current cash costs and performance metrics.The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: a) Updated Mineral Resource estimate.b) Estimates for ore loss and dilution.c) DSO specifications. 1.2 Mining 1.3.1 Mining Methodology and Mining Models The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 1-5. Table 1-5 - Bauxite Cut-off Grades at Different Plateaus Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; SRK applied a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, SRK adopted a 0.7 m loss-only approach to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. SRK also applied the following losses to account for operational constraints: a) 0.5 m ore loss is applied at the base of the deposit where the orebody comes into direct contact with the underlying clay zone.b) 0.5 m ore loss is also applied at the top of the deposit where the ore outcrops at surface to account for the stripping of topsoil and the potential contamination of ore by organic material during initial mining activities. Considering the above, the total Extractable Mining Inventory for the Minim Martap deposit is presented in Table 1-3. 1.3.2 Pit and Waste Dump Design The Minim Martap Deposit supports a 20-year Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) based on current DSO specifications and applied modifying factors. Appropriate geotechnical and access considerations have been applied and risks relating to these are considered minimal due to the shallow nature of the ultimate pit design. External waste dumps have been provided for minimal initial pre-strip. These dumps are currently located over potential inventory outside of the 20-year life of mine and may result in some sterilization in the short term. The ultimate pit design base was left to align with the base of ore (BOO) as defined by the margin ranking exercise with no additional modification applied. There is a level of uncertainty associated with the location of this interface due to the drill spacing and potential fluctuations between the drill holes and an allowance of loss has been made within the models to account for this. This represents the largest risk to the inventory as presented in this LOMP. SRK considers the risk to the Project to be minimal as there is additional inventory available at comparable grades which can be introduced to the LOMP to supplement the feed if required. The waste material scheduled in the LOMP has an average grade of ~44% Al2O3 and 3.9% SiO2 which presents the opportunity for a lower grade product for the operation. This material has not been selectively dumped or stockpiled in this study but should be considered in future study work to ascertain its future product potential and how to effectively separate the material for future use. Waste dump locations for different plateaus are illustrated in Figure 1-3 within the accompanying Media Snippet and the Life of Mine Plan Inventory is shown in Table 1-6. Table 1-6 – Life of Mine Plan Inventory 1.3.3 Life of Mine Production Schedule The LOMP provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Measured and Indicated material as a source of DSO material. The Minim Martap Project can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of product with DSO specification. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product, which can be maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. The total material hauled from the mine and used as DSO product for the purpose of reporting is summarised below in Table 1-7. Table 1-7 - Ore Summary – Hauled from Mine end as DSO Product Year-wise bauxite mined along with waste removal and the stripping ratio is presented within the accompanying Media Snippet in Figure 1-4 and bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented on the next page in Table 1-8. Table 1-8 - Yearly Proposed Bauxite Production from Different Plateaus 1.4 Mine Site Infrastructure (MSI) 1.4.1 Purpose and Scope of MSI The MSI is designed to provide support for all activities and services for mining operation. Its "battery limit" starts at the entrance of mining trucks from the Pit (excluding ROM stockpiles) and ends at the gatehouse at the beginning of the road towards the IRF (Inland Rail Facility). The MSI comprises various modular, fit-for-purpose buildings and facilities, including dome shelters and transportable office modules. These include: a) Heavy and Light Vehicle Workshopsb) HV and LV Wash Down Facilityc) Tyre Change Facilityd) Fuel Storage and Distributione) Bulk Lube Storagef) Warehouse and Consumables Supplyg) Kitchenh) Crib Roomsi) Administration Area – Ablutionsj) Officesk) Campl) Water Supply and Treatmentm) Sewage Treatment Facilityn) Waste Managemento) Weighbridgep) Other facilities include a gatehouse, medical and emergency services, control room, and security room.q) Accommodation for 40 Personss) A kitchen / mess for the residentst) Laundry facilityu) A Club House with recreation buildings, sports facilities etc.v) A dedicated building for CSRw) Main Admin Buildingx) Clinic and Emergency Response Buildingy) A Mosquez) A Technical Workshop 1.5 Hauling Road The transportation logistics operation to support the mining activities consists of transportation of the bauxite from the ore stockpile at mine end to the stockpile at IRF (Inland railway facility) through trucks and from IRF to port through rail. As part of the development of the Minim Martap Bauxite project, the establishment of a functional link road between the village of Minim, the mining areas (Béatrice, Danielle and Raymonde) and the Makor station is a major strategic issue. This access road is intended to ensure the efficient transport of ore, as well as the movement of equipment and personnel. The total length of the main road is 42 km and that of the secondary branch roads is 15.81 km. The road layout envisaged is given in Figure 1-5 in the accompanying Media Snippet. The geometry of the road has been defined to allow the safe movement of heavy machinery, with a reference speed of 40 km/h. The planned platform is 9m wide, including a 7m carriageway and two 1m shoulders. Longitudinal slopes are limited to 6% with some exceptions to 8%, with minimum radii of curvature of 100 m (80 m exceptionally). The road development work for the road network connecting the Minim Martap Bauxite Deposit to the IRF are structured across six phases, including earthworks for the IRF, new road sections to the IRF, sections overlapping the RN15 National Highway, complementary segments linking Plateau Daniel to the IRF, and roads connecting the Béatrice, Raymonde plateaus with Minim village, all integrated into a unified network. Alibaba has been assigned to construct the haul road. Alibaba is also responsible for loading bauxite in Truck (Total load of truck 80T) from MSI and hauling bauxite towards IRF, maintenance of road, unloading of bauxite at IRF stockpile and loading of bauxite into rail. 1.6 Rail Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of 3 Explorations Permits, Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal which are connected to the Douala Port through Rail Network as shown in Figure 1-6 within the accompanying Media Snippet. Minim Martap and Makan Permits are adjacent and are located around 25 km from the Ngaoundal Permit. Overall, they cover an area of 981 Sq.Km. The bauxite ore occurs as independent plateaus. A total of 79 plateaus are recorded. CAMALCO shall finance 4.5 billion CFA Francs (~US$8 million) to carry out the rehabilitation work and around 54 billion CFA Francs (~US$95 million) to build capacity in the existing railway infrastructure, through the construction of around 11 new crossing stations and the extension of existing crossing loops at 29 stations. The above referred rail infrastructure development and rehabilitation expense/ financing will be carried out by CAMALCO, which will be compensated through offsets against royalties and / or other charges (Reference No 00000001/PV/MINMIDT/SG/DM/SDAM/DM/SSEM, Dated 26th June 2025). A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finances, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, CAMRAIL & CAMALCO is being set up for the above-mentioned compensation. 1.6.1 Inland railway Facility (IRF) The nearest rail head to the Minim Martap Bauxite project is the Makor railway station, with three existing lines and a relatively flat terrain which is ideal for the establishment of the IRF. The transportation of bauxite from the mining area to the IRF location will be done by road trucks. Bauxite will be unloaded onto stockpiles adjacent to the existing rail siding prior to loading into the train ore wagons. IRF shall be developed in stages to meet the requirement of scaling of export volume from 2,1 Mtpa to 10 Mtpa and further for handling Alumina. The development will proceed in following stages: 1.6.2 Railway Network The Douala-Yaoundé-Ngaoundere railway line of Camrail connects Douala port to Ngaoundere. The line between Douala-Yaoundé -Ngaoundere is split in two sections: Transcam 1(Douala – Yaoundé, 264 km) and Transcam 2 (Yaoundé – Ngaoundéré, 620 km) Transportation Plan by Camrail It includes the planning of Regional Project for the Improvement of the Performance of the Douala N'Djamena Rail/Road Corridor (PCDN) and Belabo - Ngaoundere Railway Line Renewal Project (PRBN). Purpose of the Plan a) Douala – Yaoundé b) Belabo – Ngaoundere Axle Load a) Current Current axle load of Douala – Ngaoundere section is 18 T. b) Proposed The proposed Axle load after completion of the track renewal work all along Douala –Ngaoundere is 20 T. Rail Connectivity to Port The take-off of the proposed IRF Rail siding is at Camrail CH: 796+870 km which is about 5.75 km from the Makor station. The proposed IRF line no. 1 connects Camrail at two locations i.e. CH: 796+870 km and CH: 798+823 km. The movement of Bauxite per annum will be 2.1 million tons during Complete Track Renewal (CTR) phase and 10 million tons after CTR. Train Configuration and Loop Extension The train configuration before and after CTR is given as below: a) Train Configuration Before CTR 2L+50W(570 m Train length) b) Train Configuration Before CTR 1L+50W-2L-50W-1L (1140 m Train length) Based on the data provided, most passing loops would be able to accommodate a 539 m-long train, with an exception of Yaoundé, which has a passing loop track length of 434 m. Provision has been made during CTR works for additional crossing loops and the lengthening of existing rail loops to allow for movement of the longer trains required to facilitate the increased ore transportation. The Port’s Rail infrastructure begins from the Port’s right of way near Sandaga Road level crossing, about 1.5 km away from the Bessengue railway station as shown in the Figure 1-7 given in the accompanying Media Snippet. According to the report prepared by Systra, construction of 11 new crossing loops and 29 loop extensions has been proposed for hauling operation of longer train. The port rail network consists of two marshalling yards (Rake-forming stations). Train services run from the marshalling yards to warehouses, port terminals and port operators' industrial facilities and logistics bases. Each of these services function in the same manner as a branch line terminal, and their rail traffic management is the responsibility of the stations of the respective marshalling yards, as below: a) Port Amont The Upstream Port station for the upstream part of the port. b) Port Aval The Downstream Port station for the downstream part of the port. 1.7 Port and Transshipment 1.7.1. Project Purpose and Location The project aims to establish a dedicated facility at the Port of Douala for barge loading of bauxite. For this, three locations were shortlisted and finally one location has been finalized. This preference is mainly due to its readily available waterfront towards both the North and West, existing rail tracks (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) behind the storage space, and the potential for waterfront expansion. The site is a brownfield port facility, requiring some modification work, for bauxite transportation, and is located over 800 km away from the Minim Martap Bauxite Project. 1.7.2. Bauxite Properties and Climatic Conditions The following bauxite properties and climatic conditions have been considered at the port stockpiling facility: Physical Properties Climatic Conditions Douala experiences a tropical monsoonal climate with high humidity (99% in rainy season, 80% in dry season) and heavy rainfall from June to November. Average temperatures range from 23.33°C (August-October) to 30.56°C (March). Historical data shows average wind speeds of 6.2 km/hour in May, with maximum storm winds reaching 70 km/hour. The port has been impacted by significant storms and cyclones, such as Cyclone Eline (2000) and Cyclone Leo (2018), with Leo bringing sustained winds up to 120 mph. Tidal variation is from +0.6m (MLW) to +2.6m (MHW). 1.7.3. Site Geotechnical and Hydrographic Information Douala's earthquake hazard level is classified as low by the Think Hazard platform. The soil conditions of the selected plot are predominantly sandy formations with a clayey silt matrix, indicating an alluvial origin, where cohesion is not a governing criterion. The topography of the plot shows a mild slope from the North-East wood stockyard towards the South-West river-bank. The Wouri River at Douala Port has a very gentle slope. Recent bathymetry revealed an average channel depth of 8m for navigation, though the far side has shallower drafts (5.5m to 6.5m). Periodic dredging is required for smooth navigation. The anchorage point is located 59 km away due to the mild slope of the navigational channel. 1.7.4. Traffic Projections and Operations The project anticipates a phased increase in traffic: a) Phase 1: Starting with 1.2 mtpa (Million Tonnes Per Annum) in 2026, increasing to 2.1 mtpa in 2027 and 1.7 mtpa in 2028 and 2029.b) Phase 2: Further increasing to 6.3 mtpa in 2030, 7.0 mtpa in 2031, and reaching 10.0 mtpa in 2032. This 10 mtpa level will be checked during the Detailed Project Report (DPR) preparation. The core operations at the port facility include: a) Unloading of incoming loaded wagons. b) Stacking of unloaded cargo. c) Reclaiming from storage and barge loading for transshipment. 1.7.5. Rail Transportation and Wagon Handling Bauxite will be transported exclusively by dedicated rakes from the mine to the port. The selection of wagon type will prioritize efficient unloading at the port and bulk loading at the mine, aiming to maximize operational benefits and minimize the number of wagons, maintenance, and downtime in the overall system. Regarding wagon types, Flat Wagons and Covered Wagons are not suitable for large-scale bulk cargo transportation required for this project. For large cargo volumes, conventional discharge systems include: a) Wagon Tippler arrangements for Top-Open Wagons. b) Track Hoppers and associated tunnels for Bottom-Discharge type Wagons. However, both requires considerable space, deep excavation, major civil works (especially challenging at Douala due to high water table), and a long implementation time. Both systems involve complex mechanical arrangements and control systems. Grafix Engineering Consultant Pvt. Ltd. is conducting a detailed study to explore different options for wagon unloading, stockpiling and reclamation of DSO ore for further loading into the barges. At the initial stage wagon unloading has been planned using crawler or tyre-mounted Mobile Crane (fitted with outriggers) having grab attachment from both sides of the rail siding. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be done using pay loaders. However to cater the enhanced production at a later stage, wagon unloading has been planned by using an electric-driven, rail-mounted travelling equipment with a traversing spiral (screw) type vertical unloading arm. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be carried out using mechanised stacker reclaimer or travelling tripper and pay loader combination. Two existing rail corridors (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) are available near the project site. Corridor 2 is considered best suited for the project, particularly for fully mechanised handling, and offers adequate siding length to potentially accommodate a full rake without splitting in earlier stages. However, splitting loaded rakes will become unavoidable at higher traffic volumes. 1.7.6. Storage Capacity and System Efficiency The design principle for the export facility emphasizes ensuring ships do not wait for cargo. Therefore, storage capacity will typically be at least one ship load or marginally higher, increasing with the number of ships to account for random arrivals, equipment downtime, and unforeseen rake disruptions. The conclusions in the Report prepared by Grafix Engineering Consultants Pvt. Ltd relating to the Port Studies: Planning and Design. recommend storage capacity of either 1.5 times the maximum ship size or 1/15 times the annual throughput. Various storage options are considered, with initial stockpile capacities ranging from 0.2 MT to 0.3 MT and final capacities up to 0.5 MT. Some options involve extensive payloader and dumper operations, with stockpile heights initially limited to 6m due to soil properties and practical considerations. More mechanized options involve mobile rail-mounted unloading equipment discharging onto ground conveyors for stacking with elevated mobile tripper conveyors or rail-mounted travelling stacker/reclaimers. One option which utilizes Rail Siding Corridor-2 and a Rail Mounted Travelling type Stacker/Reclaimer, is considered best suited for fully mechanised handling. Barge loader types vary from fixed radial movement loaders to those capable of travelling between multiple berths for greater economy. 1.7.7. Transhipment and Waterfront Operations The facility will handle 10,000 DWT self-propelled barges for transshipment. The target ship size at anchorage is 170,000 DWT, with a loading target of 20,000 tonnes/day using Floating Cranes (provided by others). 24-hour night navigation is possible. The anchorage area is deemed tranquil enough for year-round transshipment, with 320 safe operating days per annum considered for barge movement and ship loading. The selected plot, being at a corner of the water body, has both North and West waterfront access. The West side waterfront is initially preferred for barge loading due to an existing sheet pile front and direct access to the backup area. The existing Wood Handling Jetty on the North side may need to be dismantled to optimize waterfront utilization as traffic increases. 1.8 Environment Social and Community The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. 1.8.1 ESMP Budget Separate ESMP budget has been calculated for incorporation of the mitigation measures, identified for individual areas, which has been suitably considered under the cost head of respective unit operations. 1.9 Bauxite Market and Pricing Camalco commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap bauxite mine in Cameroon. This independent assessment notes the following. Forecast Priced for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 1-8 within the accompanying Media Snippet. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. 1.10 Project Execution and Implementation Plan 1.10.1. Implementation Schedule The total estimated time-period for project implementation is estimated at 12 months for stage 1 of the project development from the "Initiation of Project Construction Activities". This schedule assumes that all related studies (Geology, Mining, MSI, Road, Rail, Port, etc.), finalization of project details, financing arrangements, statutory government clearances, and creation of a nucleus project organization are completed before construction begins. The DFS itself is tentatively scheduled for completion by August 2025. 1.10.2. Contracting Model The project will use an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) model. The EPCM scope includes design, construction, and commissioning of equipment and facilities, encompassing mine infrastructure, transport logistics, road design, project-wide operations/maintenance infrastructure, and contract arrangements with rail/port authorities. The implementation strategy for various packages is based on discrete turnkey mode, where contracts have been awarded to separate agencies are awarded based on their expertise (e.g., main equipment supply, civil work, structural steelwork, utilities). This approach is chosen to balance time and cost for the project, with an optimized number of discrete turnkey packages (four identified). The four packages are: Mine Development and Operation, Hauling Road, Rail Operation, and Port Construction and Transshipment. The total operation of mining of Bauxite, stockpiling, Rail transportation, and Transshipment has been distributed under three (3) major Packages. The Packages and the selected agencies responsible for execution of the packages are mentioned in Table 1-9 as presented below. Table 1-9 : Operation Methodology 1.10.3. Exclusions from EPCM Scope Certain critical aspects remain under the Owner's (Camalco's) team, including mine pit design, mine road network design (except integration), procurement and management of mine pit equipment, performance of mining operations, acquisition of rights-of-way/permits, environmental/ social investigations, community programs, test work, land acquisition, and financial modeling. 1.10.4. Owner's Execution Team and Operational Readiness Camalco's Owner's Project Team will be onboarded gradually, including construction, engineering, HSEC, procurement, and management roles, to ensure a smooth transition to operations. 1.10.5. Participation of Authorities Successful project implementation requires significant engagement and agreement with key Cameroonian stakeholders: a) Ministry of Mines (MINMIDT) for exploitation permits and regulatory framework. b) Ministry of Environment (MINEPDED) for environmental impact assessments, guidelines, certificates, and mine closure plans. c) Ministry of Transportation for road use licenses and right-of-way discussions. d) CamRail (rail service provider) for train control, track improvements, bauxite train priority, crew management, asset management, and infrastructure validation. e) Port Authority of Douala (PAD) for access to the Wooden Terminal, dredging, right of way for conveying systems, and utility connections. 1.10.6. Engineering and Design The EPCM Contractors will manage engineering to deliver contractual requirements within budget and schedule, complying with legislative requirements and recognized codes. The scope includes providing engineering support, participating in change management, supporting construction, providing technical input for procurement, reviewing vendor drawings, and assisting with commissioning and ramp-up. Battery limits for design are clearly defined for Mining, MSI, Road, IRF, Port, and Transshipment. 1.11 Cost and Financial Analysis 1.11.1 Operating Cost Table 1-10 summarises the breakdown of cash costs. Table 1-10 - Summary of Cash Costs Figure 1-9 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows that transport and port operations constitute 82% of the all in sustaining costs (costs of production). Royalties and levies comprise 8%, while mining and waste removal only constitute 9% of all in sustaining costs. 1.11.2 Capital Expenses The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises of a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, mine camp for Camalco personnel and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for rail upgrade but will be reimbursed for these upfront funds. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 1-11. Table 1-11 - Total Capital Expenditure 1.11.3 Sustaining Capital Sustaining capital costs are included in contractor costs. Contract mining cost and haulage cost from mine to IRF are inclusive of a capital charge and as such, no separate sustaining capital expenditure for the project owner is applied. Arise Port and Logistics, the contractor chosen for port and logistics, includes the maintenance of rolling stock. 1.11.4 Project Economics Table 1-12 presents a summary of key outcomes in the cashflow analysis of the project in real terms and Figure 1-10 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows the annual free cash flow in real terms. Table 1-12 – Summary of Key Economic Assumptions 1.11.5 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity for the impact of changes in key assumptions, namely bauxite price, mining and other costs, transport and capital expenditure, to the project evaluation was conducted. Each assumption was independently increased and decreased by 10% and 20% to determine the impact on the project cash flow value, as detailed in, as illustrated in Figure 1-11 within the accompanying Media Snippet. From this sensitivity analysis, it is evident that the NPV is most sensitive to changes in the bauxite price followed by transport cost, but with much less sensitivity. Mining operating costs and capital expenditure have the least impact on project NPV. APPENDIX 1 – COMPETENT PERSON STATEMENTS Competent Person’s Statement – Mineral Resources The information in this announcement that relates to mineral resources is based on information compiled or reviewed by Mr Rodney Brown, of SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd. Mr Rodney Brown is a member of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is undertaking, to qualify as a Competent Person in the terms of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). Mr Brown consents to the inclusion in the announcement of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Person’s Statement – Ore Reserves The information in this report that relates to Ore Reserves is based on information compiled or reviewed by Mr Donald Elder, of SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr Scott McEwing, of SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr Tyrone Woodfin, of SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Mr Mihir Malla, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and is currently employed by Camalco.

Mr Elder, Mr McEwing, Mr Woodfin and Mr Malla consents to the disclosure of information in this report in the form and context in which it appears. APPENDIX 2 – ORE RESERVE STATEMENT SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd (SRK) has contributed to an updated Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, which is part of the Minim Martap mining project located in the Adamawa Province of central Cameroon. The update to the Ore Reserve estimate is based on an updated Mineral Resource estimate, completed by Mr Rodney Brown from SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd dated June 2025 and a DFS (Detailed Feasibility Study Minim-Martap Bauxite Project) dated August 2025, compiled by M. N. Dastur and Company (P) Ltd and a LOMP completed by SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd. The project is owned by Camalco SA, a wholly owned subsidiary for Canyon Resources Limited. This Ore Reserve estimate adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of August 2025, is shown in Table 1. The Ore Reserve estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: The Ore Reserve estimate considers only three plateaus within the Minim Martap concession area: Danielle, Raymonde and Beatrice. There is sufficient ore, at the required product grade, to fulfill the 20-year mine plan that supports this Ore Reserve. The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: Figure 1 within the accompanying Media Snippet provides a summary of the conversion from the 2025 Mineral Resource model to the 2025 Ore Reserve estimate. Table 1: Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – Effective Date 31 August 2025 Notes: APPENDIX 3 – JORC CODE 2012 TABLE 1 Section 1: Sampling techniques and data (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections). Section 2: Reporting of exploration results Section 3: Estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources (Criteria listed in Section 1 and, where relevant, in Section 2 also apply to this section.) Section 4 Estimation and Reporting of Ore Reserves (Criteria listed in section 1, and where relevant in section 2 and 3, also apply to this section.) This announcement has been approved for release by the Canyon’s Board of Directors. Forward Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements This announcement contains “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information”, such as statements and forecasts which include (without limitation) financial forecasts, production targets, industry and trend projections, statements about the feasibility of the Project and its financial outcomes (including pursuant to the DFS), future strategies, results and outlook of Canyon and the opportunities available to Canyon. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements and information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “is expecting”, “budget”, ‘outlook”, “scheduled”, "target", “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, or “believes”, or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might”, or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such information is based on assumptions and judgments of Canyon regarding future events and results. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements and information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, targets, performance or achievements of Canyon to be materially different from any future results, targets, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, sensitivities, contingencies, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are beyond the control of Canyon and its directors and management. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Key risk factors (including as associated with the DFS) are detailed (non-exhaustively) in this announcement or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements). These and other factors (such as risk factors that are currently unknown) could cause actual results, targets, performance or achievements anticipated (including in the DFS) to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information (including Canyon’s belief that it has a reasonable basis to expect it will be able to fund the costs of the Project for its estimated life of mine) are (further to the above) based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of Canyon made in light of its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that Canyon believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although Canyon believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and information (including as described throughout this announcement) are reasonable, readers are cautioned that this is not exhaustive of all factors which may impact on the forward-looking statements and information. Canyon does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements or information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. Investors should note that there is no certainty that the Project will be feasible and there can be no assurance of whether it will be developed, constructed and commence operations, whether the DFS results will be accurate, whether production targets will be achieved or whether Canyon will be able to raise funding when it is required (nor any certainty as to the form such capital raising may take, such as equity, debt, hybrid and/or other capital raising). It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that dilute or otherwise affect the value of Canyon’s shares. It is also possible that Canyon could pursue other ‘value realisation’ strategies such as sale, partial sale, or joint venture of the Project. Risk factors which are set out (non-exhaustively) in this announcement, or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements, highlight key factors identified by Canyon which may cause actual results to differ from the DFS or may otherwise have material detrimental impacts on Canyon and its business. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend on interpretations and geological assumptions, minerals prices, cost assumptions and statistical inferences (and assumptions concerning other factors, including mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors) which may ultimately prove to be incorrect or unreliable. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are regularly revised based on actual exploration or production experience or new information and could therefore be subject to change. In addition, there are risks associated with such estimates, including (among other risks) that minerals mined may be of a different grade or tonnage from those in the estimates and the ability to economically extract and process the minerals may become compromised or not eventuate. Canyon’s plans, including its mine and infrastructure plans, and timing, for the Project, are also subject to change. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the production targets, financial forecasts or other forecasts or other forward-looking statements or information will be achieved. Investors are advised that the assumptions and inputs to the financial model may require review as project development progresses. While the Company considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the production targets or estimated outcomes indicated by the DFS (such as the financial forecasts) will be achieved. Given the various uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely on the results of the DFS. Production Targets and Financial Forecasts derived from the Production Targets This announcement contains production targets for the Project, which are 100% underpinned by the Proved and Probable category Ore Reserves estimated at the Project pursuant to the JORC Code (2012). The estimated Ore Reserves underpinning the production targets have been prepared by a competent person in accordance with the JORC Code. The Inferred category Mineral Resource estimates at the Project have not been included in the Ore Reserves or production targets and have not been included when determining the forecast financial information detailed in this announcement. There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Mineral Resources (or Ore Reserves) in relation to that mineralisation. The production targets for the Project and the financial forecasts disclosed in this announcement (including as derived from those production targets) are based on the material assumptions outlined in this announcement and are subject to various risk factors, such as those (non-exhaustively) outlined, or referred to, in this announcement and in previous ASX announcements. These include assumptions and risk factors about the availability of funding. While Canyon considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are accurate or that the production targets or financial forecasts as indicated in this announcement will be achieved. Non-IFRS financial measures This announcement contains certain financial measures (such as NPV and IRR) that are not recognised under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Although the Company believes these measures provide useful information about the Company's financial forecasts, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flow prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures are not based on IFRS, they do not have standardised definitions and the way the Company calculates these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Consequently, undue reliance should not be placed on these measures. Not financial product advice This announcement, and the information provided in it, does not constitute, and is not intended to constitute, financial product or investment advice, financial, legal, tax, accounting or other advice, or a recommendation to acquire any securities of Canyon. It has been prepared without taking into account the objectives, financial or tax situation or particular needs of any individual. Canyon is not licensed to provide financial product advice in respect of an investment in securities or otherwise. Past performance Any information regarding past performance included in this announcement is given for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as (and is not) an indication of Canyon’s views, or that of any other party involved in its preparation, on Canyon’s future performance or condition or prospects. Not an offer This announcement is not a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other offering document under Australian law or any other law and will not be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This announcement is for information purposes only and is not an invitation, offer or recommendation with respect to the subscription, purchase or sale of any security in Canyon, or any other financial products or securities, in any place or jurisdiction. No liability The information contained in this announcement has been prepared in good faith by Canyon. However, no guarantee, representation or warranty expressed or implied is or will be made by any person (such as Canyon and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, associates, advisers and agents) as to the accuracy, reliability, correctness, completeness or adequacy of any statements, estimates, options, conclusions or other information contained in this announcement, except as required by law. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Canyon and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, associates, advisers and agents each expressly disclaims any and all liability, including, without limitation, any liability arising out of fault or negligence, for any loss arising from the use of or reliance on information contained in this announcement including representations or warranties or in relation to the accuracy or completeness of the information, statements, opinions, forecasts, reports or other matters, express or implied, contained in, arising out of or derived from, or for omissions from, this announcement including, without limitation, any financial information, production targets, financial forecasts, estimates or projections and any other information derived therefrom. Statements in this announcement are made only as of the date of this announcement unless otherwise stated and the information in this announcement remains subject to change without notice. No responsibility or liability is assumed by Canyon or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, associates, advisers or agents for updating information in this announcement or to inform any recipient of any new or more accurate information or any errors or omissions of which Canyon or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, associates, advisers or agents may become aware, except as required by law. __________________________ 1 Economics are on a 100% basis.

Title: Windows on Arm PCs can now connect to Meta Quest — Microsoft sneaks out Mixed Reality Link update

Full Content:
Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on Arm, letting Snapdragon X PCs connect to Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you have a PC powered by a Snapdragon X processor, you can now connect it to your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset. Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on ARM PCs, giving users more flexibility when it comes to using a local Windows PC within virtual reality. It's not clear when Microsoft added support for PCs powered by Snapdragon X processors. The Mixed Reality Link listing in the Microsoft Store states that the app received an update on August 29, but there does not appear to be a change log. A Reddit post by user "Nicalay2" highlighted the new capability. Regardless of whether the feature is brand-new or rolled out previously, it's a nice addition to Mixed Reality Link. Microsoft has worked hard over the years to improve app compatibility for Windows 11 on Arm. Mixed Reality Link is an app that allows you to connect up to three virtual monitors to a supported Meta Quest headset. The app is still in preview and works with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. The app allows you to connect your PCs to your headset wirelessly or through a wired connection and creates a multi-monitor setup that's only visible to you. It's also possible to access a Windows 365 Cloud PC on a Meta Quest headset. Mixed Reality Link was seemingly limited to Intel and AMD-powered PCs until recently. Microsoft's support document for the app still lacks any mention of Snapdragon X PCs, such as the Surface Pro 11. But Reddit user "Nicalay2" was able to connect a Surface Pro powered by a Snapdragon X chip to Mixed Reality Link. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Meta Quest 3S is a next-gen VR headset that was designed to be affordable. It features a powerful chipset, comes with next-gen controllers, and supports the best Meta Quest games and apps. One of the main draws of the Meta Quest 3S is its price. Nicholas Sutrich, who leads VR coverage over at Android Central, said "the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous" when discussing the rumored pricing of the Meta Quest 3S. Those rumors turned out to be accurate, and the result was a "triumph", according to Sutrich. The Meta Quest 3S sets the standard for affordable VR, delivering much of the same experiences as its more expensive sibling, the Meta Quest 3. There are some tradeoffs, of course, such as the Meta Quest 3S having a narrower field of view and worse display, but Meta had to trim some features and specs to hit the $299.99 price point. I've reviewed VR headsets and covered the virtual reality space for years, dating back to the awkward days of the Gear VR. I've played the best Meta Quest games, interviewed game developers while battling in virtual reality, and am no stranger to streaming Xbox games through the cloud. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a special version of the headset with unique coloring and some bundled extras. It comes with a pre-installed Elite Strap ($70 value), an Xbox controller ($65 value), and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate ($60 value). The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only available for a limited time, but how long that time will be is unclear. Meta sold out of the Xbox Edition of the headset quickly but Best Buy still has stock. Considering the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is $100 more than the normal Meta Quest 3S, you get quite a bit extra for the extra cash. Sutrich called the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition the "best value in VR," and I agree. Our Executive Editor Jez Corden went hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. Corden said Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest 3S is "absolutely awesome" and broke down the partnership that made the device possible. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is an excellent bargain, but if you don't need an Xbox controller or want to grab a headset at a lower price, the standard Meta Quest 3S is available and is also a great option. "The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the best value you'll find in VR today. The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's $119 worth of stuff you're getting for free, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle." — Nicholas Sutrich ✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition 👉See at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard.

Title: Whales Load Up On Ethereum, But Analysts Fear $4K Dip Ahead

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum showed fresh buying pressure this week after reports that a major Bitcoin whale dramatically increased its Ether holdings, a move market watchers say could reshape short-term flows. According to reports, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin whales bought roughly 820,220 ETH over the course of two weeks, a haul valued at about $3.6 billion at current prices. The purchases were logged across multiple addresses and have drawn attention because they represent a large transfer of capital into Ether rather than Bitcoin. Traders say such concentrated accumulation can lift sentiment and draw other large holders into the market. Ethereum’s latest trading performance has mirrored the big move. At the time of reporting, ETH traded around $4,390, with a 24-hour trading volume of $39 billion and a market cap near $538 billion. 🐳 THIS OG BITCOIN WHALE HAS BOUGHT 820,224 ETH WORTH $3.6 BILLION IN JUST 2 WEEKS. HE DEFINITELY KNOWS SOMETHING 👀 pic.twitter.com/iG9Su2BGZE — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) August 31, 2025 The token was up 2% over the previous day. Those raw numbers underline that demand for Ether remains high even as some parts of the market pull back. Derivatives activity tells a more mixed story. Reported data shows derivatives volume fell 14% to $61 billion, while open interest climbed 2.90% to $60 billion. The OI Weighted metric declined -0.0007%, a small drop that indicates a minimal reduction in positioning strength. According to these movements, dealers comment that the market may be consolidating: less new trades but more positions held. Mixing technicals with on-chain data, current forecasts point to moderate upside. Based on the latest prediction, Ether is expected to rise 11% and reach $4,870 by October 1, 2025. Market sentiment is listed as Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index reads 46 (Fear). Over the last 30 days, ETH logged 47% green days and an 9% price volatility reading. Those indicators suggest a market that has room to run, but which still carries meaningful uncertainty. Analysts have offered a cautionary note. According to analyst Ted, ETH’s recent outperformance versus Bitcoin may pause for a brief retest around $4,000 as liquidity clusters are swept and traders reassess exposure. He points to order-book dynamics that often trigger a pullback before new upward moves — a pattern that has played out in prior rallies. $ETH has been holding up really well compared to BTC. But there’s still a chance of $4K retest. Just take a look at huge liquidity clusters and you’ll understand. Just keep one thing in mind: I’m just short-term bearish. pic.twitter.com/D9XIrxr5zq — Ted (@TedPillows) August 31, 2025 Investors and desks say they are watching three things: the flow of large on-chain buys, whether derivatives open interest continues to rise, and whether price holds above key support near $4,000. Reports of whale accumulation have sparked talk of rising institutional interest, but the drop in spot derivatives volume shows some short-term participants stepping back to wait. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. | Photo Credit: - Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares traded lower by 0.43 per cent at ₹1,351.30 on Monday morning at 11.30 am, despite announcing a joint venture with Meta to develop enterprise AI solutions for India. The stock opened at ₹1,356 and hit a day’s high of ₹1,357 before declining to ₹1,340.60. The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore ($100 million) in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. The joint venture will offer AI Platform-as-a-Service and pre-configured solutions targeting Indian enterprises and SMBs, with the transaction expected to close in Q4 2025. Brokerage firms maintained positive ratings on RIL following recent AGM announcements. JPMorgan retained its Overweight rating with a target price of ₹1,695, while Kotak maintained Add with ₹1,555 target. Jefferies and HSBC kept Buy ratings at ₹1,670 and ₹1,630 respectively. Nuvama maintained Buy with the highest target of ₹1,733. According to Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart, the stock decline reflects investor disappointment with the Jio IPO timeline being pushed to H1 2026, later than expected 2025 listing. He noted RIL’s historical pattern of post-AGM declines despite significant announcements. Key AGM highlights included the definitive Jio IPO timeline, launch of Reliance Intelligence subsidiary, and ambitious retail growth targets of 20 per cent CAGR over three years. The company reiterated plans to double EBITDA between FY2022-FY2027 and achieve ₹1 lakh crore FMCG revenue within five years. Analysts remain optimistic about RIL’s long-term prospects, citing its diversified business model and strategic investments in AI and new energy. The company’s New Energy business is expected to potentially match the scale of its O2C operations. Trading volume stood at 45.04 lakh shares worth ₹608.59 crore, with 59.48 per cent deliverable quantity indicating sustained investor interest despite the price decline.

While analysts see it as a major value-unlocking event, concerns remain over execution risks, holding company discounts, and missed opportunities from not pursuing a demerger.

Mukesh Ambani is gearing up for Jio's mega IPO — tipped as the "mother of all IPOs" – but Reliance Industries' 44 lakh shareholders may be sidelined. Unlike the Jio Financial Services spin-off, this listing won't give them direct shares. Instead, they'll benefit indirectly via RIL’s 66.3% stake, which may face a holding company discount from investors seeking direct exposure.
