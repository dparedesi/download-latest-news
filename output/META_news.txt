UPDATED 11:24 EDT / MAY 16 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Initial public offerings of stock inched back this week as eToro’s IPO soared 29% over its initial price, Chime filed and Pony AI in China filed confidentially. But don’t expect a full-scale return in this choppy economy. Herald the coming of the software-only cloud hyperscaler — starting with Salesforce. AI leaders suddenly are confronting reality — excessive hype and high expense, not to mention diverging interests and doubts about the headroom for cutting-edge AI such as reasoning models. Meta even reportedly is delaying its latest mega-model after it didn’t show enough improvement, and it’s not alone. But they all still expect a big payoff from the continuing stream of new models from Google DeepMind, OpenAI and more, and from AI services — some, such as Box’s and Boomi’s, providing crucial deeper links to enterprise data and processes. For now, many AI and data companies are still raking in big rounds, such as Perplexity and AI21 Labs, along with Anthropic closing a $2 billion debt facility — honestly it’s kind of exhausting, as you can see below. And they’re spending that cash, such as Databricks buying Neon for $1 billion. Then there’s Saudi Arabia’s big multibillion-dollar AI play, Humain, with Nvidia, AMD and Amazon feeding at the Mideast trough. But not everyone’s making bank — Cohere’s revenue reportedly came in very low — so you have to think investors are going to start getting pickier at some point. Quantum computing still seems years off from real commercial potential, but that’s not stopping investors from pouring money into quantum startups such as Classiq. Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook how to do business. Cook wisely ignores him, no doubt waiting for him to forget it once the next distraction comes along. A huge event week is coming up, with Computex, Dell Tech World (check out Dave Vellante’s deep dive on Dell’s strategy in his latest Breaking Analysis), Red Hat Summit, Microsoft Build, Google I/O and commercetools Elevate, most of which will be covered by SiliconANGLE and most of them onsite by theCUBE and theCUBE Research as well. And there are a few important earnings reports next week as well: Palo Alto Networks, Snowflake, Zoom, Workday and Autodesk. You can hear more about this and other tech news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Salesforce Agentforce and Data Cloud: A path to the software-only hyperscaler In the race to deploy AI, industry leaders confront hype and expense – but project a promising future OpenAI and Microsoft engage in tense negotiations over the future of their partnership Meta set to postpone release of Llama 4 Behemoth model, report claims Are AI reasoning models reaching limits already?

Title: Pokemon TCG Hands-On: Is The Destined Rivals Expansion Worth It?

The newest TCG expansion is nearly here, but should players buy it? By Laura Gray With only a few weeks left to go before the release date of the Pokemon TCG Destined Rivals expansion, players are likely wondering if they should be waiting in line at local card shops or box stores on launch day. This new Scarlet and Violet set does have plenty to offer players, but there are a few things to know before jumping in. The Destined Rivals expansion for the Pokemon TCG is the second English set to add Trainer cards to the modern meta. These cards, which were seen in much older sets back in the 2000s, include things like Misty’s Psyduck, Brock’s Onix, Team Rocket’s Meowth, and so many more. Modern releases have reimagined some of the Trainer cards from previous generations, while also adding new options from favorite characters like Arven and Marnie. These cards alone may be the reason fans choose to grab up Destined Rivals ETBs on launch, but there are a few things to know about the set after The Pokemon Company provided me an early look at the cards. Official reveal of Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex special illustration rare #DestinedRivals pic.twitter.com/P9IYYEqexT The Pokemon TCG Destined Rivals list contains 244 different cards. This is one of the biggest Scarlet and Violet expansions to date, challenging Evolve Skies from Sword and Shield. A massive card list has pros and cons, but most notably makes pull rates unstable for the set. We opened 55 packs with our preview, and only pulled four cards total that were of a Gold Star rarity or better. These are some of the most challenging odds that have appeared so far in the Scarlet & Violet era, surpassing Prismatic Evolutions in difficulty. This is surprising, as there aren’t any “typical” chase cards like Charizard in this expansion. Pokemon TCG sets have struggled with repeat syndrome in recent years. Due to collector hype, expansions typically spotlight a handful of favorite, highly desirable species over others. This includes Pikachu, Charizard, Eevee, all Eeveelutions, and Legendaries in particular. However, the Trainer’s element of the newer expansions has forced the TCG to print some particularly interesting cards. Cynthia’s Garchomp was an expected addition, but Cynthia’s Roserade is an elegant and surprising card that may not normally have gotten attention without this set. Additionally, Ethan’s Sudowoodo takes the stage, putting a spotlight on a regularly forgotten fighting type. Destined Rivals is unusually diverse as a card list thanks to the trainers that are featured in the lineup, and this makes it particularly fun for those who play the game competitively or casually with friends. Like with Prismatic Evolutions and Journey Together, Destined Rivals has already seen issues with stock availability. The Pokemon TCG has been facing shortages on the same level as during 2020 and 2021 with recent sets, and pre-orders for Destined Rivals have already sold out on The Pokemon Center website. This could make obtaining this set difficult for fans, and the low pull rates from the high number of cards on the list will make it even more difficult for those looking to obtain rare cards like Special Illustrations or Golden full arts. Players looking to find these cards could need to purchase multiple booster boxes, making it an investment very similar to the Evolving Skies struggle of the Galar era. Those looking to purchase this set will likely have to go up against resellers at big box stores on launch day, with the high possibility that no sets will be available to those who aren’t at the stores as they open. Additionally, reselling will be an issue in the weeks after launch, with sets bought at MSRP being resold for well above the original price. This can make finding packs difficult, especially for younger players. Yes, despite the setbacks, Destined Rivals is worth investing in. The Trainer’s cards of this set are particularly exciting, even if you don’t pull the rarest options in the box. The Team Rocket’s cards include beautiful standard arts of the Kantonian Legendary Birds, Ho-oh, and Mewtwo, among many others. Cynthia’s and Arven’s cards are both powerful and offer unique strategies for those who might want to make a themed deck, and Marnie’s cards bring a fresh round of powerful dark types to the meta. While this might not be the best set for those looking to collect cards, those wanting to play will have a plethora of options to enhance decks and energize strategies. Pokemon TCG fans won’t want to miss out on having these unique cards in their collections, as it could be quite some time before this style of card returns to expansions in the future.

Title: Week In Review: Bigly Week On Wall Street
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/05/16/week-in-review-bigly-week-on-wall-street/
Time Published: 2025-05-16T13:25:49Z
Full Content:
ByAdam Sarhan ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 06: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... More morning trading on August 06, 2024 in New York City. Stocks opened up slightly up in the three major indexes a day after the Dow Jones and the S & P 500 had their worst day of trading since 2022, amid a global market sell-off centered around fears of a U.S. recession. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Stocks soared on Monday after a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war. That was the big trade elephant in the room. The fact that the U.S. and China are speaking and are on good terms is a good sign and helps remove fear of an all out trade war. That big fear that the tariffs would crush the global economy was the primary catalyst that sent stocks lower in February and March. Trump eased the tariffs in April and stocks soared. Now we are getting closer to trade deals which is very encouraging. In other news, inflation came in weaker than expected which is a very good sign. On Monday, the White House announced a 90-day suspension on new tariffs targeting Chinese imports. This was a step in the “right” direction and helped the market rally nicely. This de-escalation will not only help the U.S. and China it will also help the U.S. strike deals with other trading partners. The pause offers both parties time to work toward a more durable resolution — which is a welcomed sign. I like to focus on how the market reacts to the news. For now, the reaction is very positive. The market soared on the news and was up just about every day this week. The S&P 500 rallied, erasing its year-to-date losses and turned positive on the year. The same is true for the Nasdaq 100. Additionally, and equally impressive, both indices are now “only” 4% (or thereabouts) below their record highs. That’s very impressive considering they were both down over 20% five to six weeks ago. If we keep making progress like this, we can easily hit new highs very soon. In other bullish news, inflation continued to fall which gives the Fed room to cut rates, if it wants to. This added to the rally. The latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation easing for the second straight month. Headline inflation rose at a 2.4% annualized rate in March — lower than February and below economists’ expectations. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also softened to its lowest level in over three years. Remember, the Fed has dual mandate: keep unemployment low and keep inflation near 2%. So far, it can check both boxes. If the data continues to improve, the Fed can stop raising rates and possible cut rates later this year. For markets, the prospect of a less aggressive Fed added another boost to risk appetite and stocks. In the middle of the week, attention turned to Washington, where lawmakers prepared for a big vote on President Donald Trump’s proposed tax and spending package. The bill, which includes cuts for both individuals and corporations, has become a focal point for investors. The bulls want to see the bill pass because tax relief could stimulate corporate profits and consumer spending — two big wins for stocks. However, internal divisions remain, and some lawmakers cautioned that a vote could be delayed. Despite the uncertainty, the market remained mostly optimistic that some version of the package would eventually pass. It was also a big week for many companies. Walmart reported earnings and the company said tariffs are not really that big of a deal right now. The CEO also said that he’s ready to raise prices, if needed in the future. Here’s a link to the earnings transcript. Shares of Novo Nordisk dropped sharply after CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen announced his resignation, Yahoo! Finance reported. The company has faced rising pressure in the competitive obesity drug market, particularly from U.S. rival Eli Lilly. Novo has plunged over 55% since its 52-week high. Charter Communications surged following news of a planned merger with its cable rival, Cox Communications. The deal would create the nation’s second-largest cable operator as the industry adapts to the shift toward streaming. Here’s an article from CNBC that explained the merger in more detail. Shares of UnitedHealth fell hard after reporting earnings a few weeks ago. Then shares fell hard again when news spread that the Department of Justice was investigating the company. Here’s a CNBC article that explains the story in more detail. Applied Materials rallied after reporting earnings which was encouraging news for tech stocks. Semiconductors have been under pressure most of this year but that could be changing. Reuters reported the news in more detail here. Take-Two disappointed investors with a weaker full-year outlook and news that the next Grand Theft Auto would be delayed. Despite topping revenue estimates, the stock dropped after cutting guidance. The WSJ reported it in more detail here. Constellation Brands rallied after Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had more than doubled its stake in the beverage giant, signaling long-term confidence in the company. Yahoo! Finance reported the news here. Shares of Meta fell on Thursday after the tech giant announced its AI model would be delayed. Reuters reported the story here. Dicks Sporting Goods announced it will acquired Foot Locker. Investor’s Business Daily reported the news here. The cooler than expected inflation data boosted sentiment, but not all economic signals were positive. April’s retail sales slowed, raising concerns about consumer momentum. On Friday, consumer sentiment came out at 50.8, which was the second lowest on record. While the U.S.-China tariff pause was the global headline, it’s not a permanent fix. Chinese officials indicated that 90 days may not be enough to bridge key disagreements, and analysts expect tariffs to remain in place through at least the end of 2025. Despite the rally, analysts caution that volatility could return. In the short-term we are very overbought and due to pullback. Strategists at Societe Generale noted that while “risk-on” sentiment may carry forward, further gains may require clearer policy outcomes and stronger fundamentals. Wall Street’s rally this week marks a sharp reversal from weakness we saw earlier this year. The S&P 500’s rebound is impressive and underscores how sensitive markets remain to macro and geopolitical developments. Looking ahead, the tug-of-war between economic data, fiscal policy, and international dynamics will continue to shape investor sentiment. For now, optimism has returned and that’s a good thing. Remember, in the short-term the market is very overbought and due to pullback. Short-term pullbacks aside, if we break out to new highs, we can easily have another bigly leg up from here.

Title: What’s Behind The 400% Rise In META Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/14: In this photo illustration, the Meta Platforms logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) has experienced a significant surge of nearly 30% in the past month, driven by investor optimism regarding a potential trade agreement with the UK and a 90-day rollback of recent tariffs between the U.S. and China. This performance notably outstrips the broader Nasdaq index, which has risen by 17%. However, it’s important to note that the stock has also faced its share of negative news. The Wall Street Journal recently reported a delay in the rollout of a flagship AI model, citing difficulties in enhancing the capabilities of its "Behemoth" large language model. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Looking at a longer timeframe, META's outperformance is even more significant, delivering a stellar 437% return since early 2023—climbing from approximately $120 to around $645—compared to the Nasdaq's 83% increase over the same period. This substantial growth can be attributed to: Let’s delve deeper into these factors. While META stock has performed remarkably well, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Meta Platforms operates the world's most popular social network, enabling people to connect with friends and family. The company's primary revenue source is advertising, which it delivers to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on user-provided information across its platforms. Meta Platforms has experienced a significant 46% revenue increase, rising from $117 billion in 2022 to $170 billion over the last twelve months. This growth can be attributed to both an increase in ad impressions and a higher average price per advertisement. Furthermore, the daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. Meta is currently benefiting from its strategic investment in artificial intelligence, which allows for more effective ad targeting. Looking ahead, the company intends to leverage AI to generate more content. Over the past three years, Meta Platforms has demonstrated strong financial performance. Its net income margin has nearly doubled, increasing from 19.9% in 2022 to 39.2% currently. This improvement is attributable to continued user growth, optimized AI infrastructure, effective ad targeting, and strategic cost reductions, including workforce adjustments. This operational success is reflected in a substantial 188% increase in Meta's net income, which rose from $23 billion to $67 billion over this period. Additionally, Meta's aggressive share repurchase program, totaling $90 billion, has reduced its outstanding shares by 4%. The combined effect of rising revenues, expanding profit margins and significantly higher net income, and fewer shares outstanding has driven a 198% surge in the company's bottom line, from $8.59 per share in 2022 to $25.64 now. The recent positive performance of Meta Platforms stock reflects investor confidence in the company's revenue-generating potential. The growth in both ad impressions and the average price per ad suggests strong future sales. Furthermore, Meta's strategic investment in AI is expected to enhance advertising revenues through better user engagement and targeting. This positive sentiment, driven by the company's improved financial performance—including strong sales growth and increased profitability—is demonstrated by the significant increase in Meta's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which has risen from 14x in 2022 to the current 25x. This financial change unfolded against a backdrop of a challenging market environment, specifically the inflation shock of 2022 that caused a significant stock market correction. During this downturn, META stock experienced a substantial 77% decline, falling from its September 2021 peak of $382 to a low of $89 by November 2022—a sharper drop than the S&P 500’s 25.4% fall. Meta's subsequent recovery was gradual, with the stock eventually returning to its pre-crisis peak by January 2024, illustrating both the market's severity and the company's inherent ability to bounce back. With a current trading price around $645, Meta Platforms' price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 25, based on its trailing adjusted EPS of $25.64. This is a notable increase from its three-year average P/E of roughly 16x. Despite this seemingly high multiple, the premium appears justified by the company's considerable opportunities in the fast-growing AI space. These AI developments are expected to drive stronger sales growth through more effective ad targeting and content creation, building upon the company's 12% average sales growth over the past three years with slightly higher projected rates. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation at $702 per share, suggesting a potential upside of approximately 10% from current levels. For long-term investors, META stock may signify an opportunity, considering the company’s strong fundamentals and positioning in the AI market. However, those apprehensive about near-term volatility should contemplate suitable strategies, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio strategy, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the previous four-year span. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond.

On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors.

Title: Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 14: Neal Mohan, CEO, YouTube attends YouTube Brandcast 2025 at David Geffen ... More Hall on May 14, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for YouTube) Alphabet has been running this ad recently: There’s Only One YouTube. Talk about bad timing. It seems Alphabet’s marketing department might not be in contact with legal, or even higher management. Consider that Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently testified in a lawsuit, attempting to prevent Alphabet’s breakup! Their argument centers on the idea that YouTube, Google Search, Google Docs, Waymo self-driving cars, and all other entities under the Alphabet umbrella have significant competition. See, Break up Google and Declare Communism. Now, Google's revenue streams can be broken down into several key areas: its core search business, advertising on YouTube, network property revenues, Google Cloud services, and a collection of other businesses. The following chart details how much each of these segments contributed to Google's overall revenue in the year 2024. Alphabet's Revenue Breakup What’s the potential impact of a breakup? Could the sum of its parts be worth significantly less than the current company, maybe even half? This explains why Google’s management is rightly worried. What would happen to all the shared intelligence and analytics expenses that boost ad sales and marketing, along with management costs? These could easily double, leaving you with half the value. The reason? Reduced size and market power. Remember when Google’s stock plummeted 10% in a day after an Apple executive hinted that Google Search was losing share? Well, a smaller, broken-up Google would definitely be in a weaker position to meet Apple’s potential price demands. Now, we take risk minimization to heart in our High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. It gets even worse. A smaller revenue base means less ability to invest in crucial new technologies and cover their fixed costs. Not a very welcome thought at a time when peers OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft are doubling down on AI development. This is an unprecedented moment, and Alphabet’s stock could plummet by 50% or even more. See Buy or Sell Google Stock. No matter what they do, that "There’s only one YouTube" ad will come back to haunt them. Timing is everything. That said, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: It looks like Meta just hit a big AI roadblock

Time Published: 2025-05-15T21:40:00Z
Full Content:
Meta (META) reportedly has delayed the release of its latest artificial intelligence model, known internally as “Behemoth,” raising concerns among employees about the effectiveness and direction of the company’s massive AI investments. Engineers have struggled to improve the large-language model’s performance compared to earlier versions in the Llama model family, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. This has prompted internal debate about whether the upgrade is substantial enough to merit public release, sources told the Journal. Shares in Meta were down more than 2% by Thursday’s close. Initially set for an April debut during Meta’s first AI developer conference, Behemoth’s launch was pushed to June and potentially has been postponed until at least the fall. When Meta released two smaller Llama models in April, the company was praised for the speed with which it has caught up with rivals when it comes to developing its own generative AI tools. The company now faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress with Behemoth and signal to Wall Street it can follow through with a return-on-investment. Meta has spent billions on AI development, with plans for up to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year. Its stock price to earnings ratio is 25.05, as of May 15, meaning investors are paying $25.05 for every $1 of earnings. Though Meta has publicly claimed Behemoth outperforms competing models such as OpenAI, Google (GOOGL), and Anthropic in some benchmarks, internal sources told the Journal that the model is facing significant training challenges, and its real-world performance may not live up to the company’s public claims. Meta’s AI journey began with its Fundamental AI Research Team, which developed the original Llama models in early 2023. However, 11 of the 14 authors of the initial Llama paper have since left the company, and newer versions are being built by a different team. Controversy also arose in April when it was revealed that the model Meta submitted to a widely used AI chatbot leaderboard was not the same version released to the public. Meta later admitted it had optimized the submitted model specifically for the benchmark. Meta is not alone in facing delays, however. OpenAI’s next major model, GPT-5, has also been postponed, with the company instead rolling out an intermediate version called GPT-4.5. Anthropic has likewise delayed the release of Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger and more powerful AI model, though it said the release is imminent.

HW 스펙을 올리면 소위 광탈이라 불렸던 배터리 사용량이 늘어날 수 밖에 없었고 삼성전자는 이 문제를 심플하게 해결했는데 배터리 크기를 키웠습니다. 설계 공간을 확보하면 발열(통풍) 처리가 유리하고 디스플레이 크기만큼 배터리 셀을 채워 넣을 수 있습니다.

'트럼프'가 하한선 10%라는 상호관세는 가격 경쟁력에 포함됩니다. '트럼프'가 미국을 다시 위대하게 제조업 국가로 만들겠다는 그 트럼프노믹스를 버티지 못하는 미국 IT 업계 중 일부는 반드시 모토로라와 IBM의 전철을 밟게 될 것입니다.

Title: What’s Happening With CoreWeave Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/15/whats-happening-with-coreweave-stock/
Time Published: 2025-05-15T11:22:57Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A laptop keyboard and CoreWeave logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo ... More taken in Krakow, Poland on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), an AI infrastructure provider, recently announced its Q1 results, reporting a loss of $1.49 per share on revenue of $982 million. This exceeded market expectations of $853 million in revenue. However, its capital expenditures plan of $20-23 billion was much higher than the $18 billion anticipated by the analysts and it didn’t sit well with investors - triggering a decline in the stock in after-hours trading. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Since its IPO at $40 per share in March, CRWV stock has surged past $65 earlier this week, significantly outperforming the NASDAQ index’s 11% gain over the same period. CoreWeave’s strong backlog of over $25 billion has contributed to its stock’s impressive performance. However, if you prefer a less volatile investment alternative, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P 500 and has delivered over 91% returns since inception. CoreWeave’s Q1 revenue of $982 million reflects an impressive 420% year-over-year increase. CoreWeave has secured significant contracts with leading AI labs, hyperscalers, and enterprises, including OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, Meta, and Mistral AI, aiding its revenue growth. The first quarter also saw OpenAI solidify its relationship with CoreWeave by committing to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. This significant agreement underscores the growing importance of CoreWeave’s infrastructure for OpenAI. Additionally, CoreWeave’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 700 bps to 62%, up from 55% in the previous year’s quarter. However, the adjusted net loss widened to $150 million from $24 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenue offset by a contraction in net margin resulted in adjusted net loss of $0.61 per share. Looking ahead, CoreWeave expects Q2’25 revenue of $1.08 billion and full-year 2025 revenue of $5.0 billion, at the mid-point of the provided range. This fares better than the consensus estimates of $987 million and $4.6 billion, respectively. CRWV stock has shown some volatility since its debut. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is significantly more stable. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? This portfolio comprises stocks that have historically provided stronger returns with lower risk compared to the broader index, offering a more predictable performance, as evident in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, could CoreWeave sustain its upward trajectory? Since the stock was only listed last year, there is no historical data to assess its historical valuation multiple. At its current price of approximately $63 (after market hours), CRWV trades at 13 times trailing revenue. With sales increasing by over 700% in 2024, over 400% in Q1, and it’s expected to grow 2.3x this year, the company’s high valuation multiple appears justified. However, the company’s high capital expenditures and widening losses remain key near-term concerns.

Business FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the company logo for CoreWeave, Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo CoreWeave shares closed 2.5 per cent lower on Thursday as the company's expanded cloud deal worth up to $4 billion with OpenAI failed to assuage investor worries over its hefty annual spending plans. The Nvidia-backed data center operator had on Wednesday said in its first earnings since going public in March it would spend about four times more than the predicted revenue in 2025. Companies are investing billions of dollars into artificial intelligence even as investor scrutiny has sharpened after the launch of DeepSeek's low-cost AI models. On a post-earnings call, executives of CoreWeave said it had signed an expansion deal with an unnamed company. A day later CoreWeave said in a regulatory filing OpenAI has committed to pay it through April 2029.

The deal also gave OpenAI a stake in CoreWeave.The company executives had also said CoreWeave had signed on a new hyperscaler as a client. The company declined to name the new client when contacted by Reuters.Analysts at Morgan Stanley and MoffettNathanson said the client could be Google-parent Alphabet. A media report in April had said Google was in talks to rent Nvidia chips from CoreWeave."Hyperscalers are direct competitors to CoreWeave and are only temporarily using CoreWeave for overflow capacity. They will likely go away once they have built out enough of their own data centers," D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said. As of last close, CoreWeave's stock has surged more than 64 per cent from its offer price in March IPO. At least seven brokerages have raised their price targets to between $50 and $80.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo CoreWeave shares closed 2.5 per cent lower on Thursday as the company's expanded cloud deal worth up to $4 billion with OpenAI failed to assuage investor worries over its hefty annual spending plans. The Nvidia-backed data center operator had on Wednesday said in its first earnings since going public in March it would spend about four times more than the predicted revenue in 2025. Companies are investing billions of dollars into artificial intelligence even as investor scrutiny has sharpened after the launch of DeepSeek's low-cost AI models. On a post-earnings call, executives of CoreWeave said it had signed an expansion deal with an unnamed company. A day later CoreWeave said in a regulatory filing OpenAI has committed to pay it through April 2029.

Title: Many Market Opportunities To Come As Tariff Debacle Concludes, According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee – Here’s His Outlook

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sees a lot of opportunity in the stock market this year. In a new interview with CNBC, Lee argues that US businesses have demonstrated resiliency in the face of the pandemic, rate hikes and now tariffs. “Right now, the 10-Year yield at 4% I think isn’t a huge burden, not only for the government, but also for the economy or for companies, so I think it’s a level of funding that businesses can earn a return on capital, and then as we think about 2026, there’s a lot to be excited about, we have deregulation coming, we have the tariff debacle behind us, we have tax cuts possibly, and then we might have better trade partnerships with other countries, meaning US companies have earnings upside. I think that the market is flat year-to-date through May, so I don’t think anyone should feel like they missed anything. I think that they’re going to have a chance to buy a lot of companies – a lot of stocks got obliterated, and I think that these washed-out names are still opportunities. We talk about it with our clients, whether it’s Tesla, or the MAG-7 (Magnificent 7), or the small-caps, there are many opportunities still.” The Magnificent Seven stocks include shares of the tech giants Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.

Title: At This $5 Billion Ohio Advisory, Financial Planning Comes With A Wall Of Touch Screens And A Dose Of AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2025/05/14/at-this-5-billion-ohio-advisory-financial-planning-comes-with-a-wall-of-touch-screens-and-a-dose-of-ai/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. CEO Craig Findley works in the Venture Lab. Walking into Venture Visionary Partners’ gleaming Sylvania, Ohio headquarters just outside of Toledo feels less like entering a wealth management firm and more like stepping into the lobby of a Silicon Valley innovator. A serene waterfall greets you at the door; sleek glass offices line the halls, while oversized digital screens pulse with real-time data and market updates. But the real centerpiece—and increasingly a beating heart of the operation—is tucked beyond the conference rooms up on the second floor: the Venture Visionary Lab. A brainchild of founder and CEO Craig Findley, the high tech control room is an unusual setting for a wealth management industry steeped in virtues like patience and measured growth. “It’s like having a second brain in the room,” argues Findley with a smile, gesturing to the space where every wall is a floor-to-ceiling touch screen. Essentially a war room meant to resemble a mini New York Stock Exchange, it combines institutional-grade investment research with Venture’s proprietary tools—and a heavy dose of cutting-edge AI, powered by OpenAI. The Lab is both an R&D center and an expensive client marketing tool used to impress its mostly midwestern clientele. "It helps clients see that we take this seriously," says Findley, 55, a finance and marketing major who graduated from Michigan’s Hillsdale College, a small, Christian, liberal arts school, in 1992. And for clients who love tech? "They’re frankly blown away." Originally envisioned as a trading, research and collaboration hub, the Lab has evolved into something much more ambitious. The room’s four walls are giant, interactive planar screens, connected to laptops through a simple barcode device. Facial recognition is required for entry, and a virtual AI assistant—cheerily nicknamed "Venture"—is ready to take notes, pull up investment research, or even recall a client’s last conversation at a moment's notice. Soon, Findley hopes, the Lab will be fully voice interactive. "Eventually, it will greet us—and clients—when we walk in," he says. Today, it's already partially there: Ask Venture about a company or client, and within seconds it retrieves curated information drawn from its approved research sources and CRM system. Founded in 2019, the $5.1 billion (assets under management) registered investment advisory firm prides itself on building deep, personalized relationships with clients, but now technology has supercharged that approach. All that high technology is not free. Findley figures his outfitting Venture Visionary Lab cost him no less than $500,000 to complete. In terms of fees, his firm traditionally charges 1% to 1.5% of assets, according to its SEC filings. One of the keys to Findley’s approach is the quality of his data inputs. New clients fill out a 62-question personality and values assessment, probing everything from relationship priorities to legacy goals. Questions vary from seemingly trivial matters about whether a client has hired a lawyer or made up a will to to more in-depth enquiries such as the core values that guide their work and personal lives. Once complete, a client’s answers are reflected back to them across the Lab’s vast digital screen in a personalized “mind map.” While this discovery process isn’t new for Venture, displaying these answers for clients in the Lab over recent months has not only made it a more interactive process but also more efficient, where Findley and his team can better identify client priorities. “It allows us to better get in the weeds during the discovery process,” he adds. The Lab doesn’t just wow clients—it helps Venture's advisors work smarter with its AI capturing meeting notes and assigns follow ups. If a client mentioned their daughter’s college acceptance during a meeting six months ago? Venture will remember—and suggest a timely congratulatory follow-up at the next touchpoint. Investment committee meetings take place inside the Venture lab. The Lab also plays a helpful role in Venture Visionary Partners’ process as a tool during investment committee meetings. Say Findley and his team are looking at Tesla stock for instance. The AI assistant can quickly pull up summarized analyst reports, financial documents and earnings calls for review, helping the firm spot patterns faster when it comes to portfolio management. They have also begun leveraging Boosted.ai’s Alfa chatbot to improve the efficiency and accuracy of market research. For instance, the team recently prompted Alfa to analyze Russell 1000 companies that reported earnings over the past three months and identify those that beat both EPS and revenue estimates. “We then paired that data with Seeking Alpha’s Earnings Revision Scores to highlight ‘triple beat’ companies—those that not only exceeded earnings and revenue expectations but also raised forward guidance,” says Findley. The firm’s flagship strategy is rising dividend stocks, primarily focusing on U.S. large-cap companies. For more aggressive investors, Venture offers a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy that seeks to capture long-term capital appreciation without chasing overheated momentum stocks. For opportunities that don’t neatly fit either profile, the firm runs an opportunistic strategy, giving the investment team flexibility to pursue compelling outliers. Some of the team’s top stock picks from these strategies include tech giants Meta and Amazon, which are trading at lower price to earnings multiples than slow-growth consumer staples like Coke and lower than top retailers Walmart and Costco, respectively. Findley also likes brokerage app Robinhood, which he says was undervalued after the market drop in April and should continue to perform well thanks to rapid earnings growth. Another top stock pick is Morgan Stanley, which could see robust growth on the back of increased corporate dealmaking and rising markets. “The stock is still 11% below the February high and trades at a fairly reasonable 14 times earnings,” says Findley. Venture also offers an ETF-based strategy that balances passive investing with tactical tilts toward sectors like technology and communications. On the fixed income side, the firm is content to take advantage of higher near-term yields by investing in government bonds, structured notes, and private credit opportunities. “We try to take the emotions out of investing," Findley says. "Clients get so caught up in politics or short-term news. History—and a visual—is worth a thousand words.” That discipline has been particularly important in recent months, as a barrage of headlines relating to Trump administration policies have whipsawed markets. Though major indexes like the S&P 500 tanked more than 10% following Trump’s initial tariff announcements in early April, the market has since leveled out and is now once again positive for the year. “Tariff policy, although well intended, caused considerable uncertainty,” says Findley. When asked about the future, Findley’s has a clear vision: Even more integration and automation for the client experience and decision-making process—but always with a human touch. “I want a client to walk into the Lab, have it recognize them by face, greet them personally, recall their last visit, and pull up everything we need without lifting a finger,” he says. But will Findley’s expensive AI-fueled rocketship also help create higher returns for Venture Visionary’s clients? The jury is still out.

Pull the military out and send those prisoners to a supermax prison in the US. Yes, they will then be entitled to full rights to defend themselves in American courts but we all have to make sacrifices. That leaves you with 45 square miles (117 km2) of land and water on the shore of Guantánamo Bay. So then you take a page out of Trump’s playbook and turn it into a luxurious resort for the rich and wealthy. You can have high-priced hotels, casinos, knocking shops, restaurants and shopping arcades. If you told Trump that a prime block of land would be set aside for a Trump hotel, he would totally buy into the whole project. Workers you ask? Put in contracts for Cuban workers and buy produce from them to keep the Cubans onside and not to stir up trouble. It’s either that or follow that tech bro plan which would be nothing more that a money pit – with them the major beneficiaries. Much better than the status quo, so why not give it a try? Trump says he will order removal of all US sanctions on Syria Anadolu Agency Trump signs ‘largest arms deal in history,’ secures $600bn Saudi investment pledge The Cradle The insane, demagogic incoherence of Trump and the Trump administration keeps everyone guessing. A scam for all seasons. https://t.co/hgHr4TlauL I completely disagree with all commentators currently claiming a “break” in US/Israeli relations or speaking about a mood shift or Trump breaking with Netenyahu. You are only confused here if you accept such claims as valid. Trump is not lifting all Syrian sanctions for nothing, and we are certainly not speaking about mineral rights or any other such nonsense here. The genocide is still on, Netenyahu is still open about it, and I would bet my last cent that the concessions extracted from this deal are that Syria will take in Gazan refugees. I think this is primary purpose of Trump’s entire trip, to carry on the very same Israeli and State Department policy that was formulated in October/November of 2023. Every manner of PR and bullshit media flak has been thrown up around this but the plan has carried on regardless for 19 months now. I see no reason to think Trump’s tour is not simply a repeat of Bliken’s efforts in 2023 and 2024 to find somewhere to dump the still living Gazans. Whether the rest of the Arab states have agreed to the displacement, I don’t know. But I for one am certain that the cutout Jolani has agreed to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Gaza(His trip to meet Macron has convinced me). I am surprised so many commentators have forgotten about this entire angle. Pipeline gas from Qatar to Europe, via Saudi, Jordan and Syria? Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The article flies over a few facts, making it seem that its the current government that has abandoned nuclear power – in reality, that decision was made 20 years or more when a number of plants under construction were mothballed – partially because they didn’t make much economic sense at the time, and partially under intense US pressure over its nuclear weapons program. The one remaining nuclear power plant, at Maanshan (a very nice surf spot as it happens) is more than 40 years old and would cost a fortune to keep running. Its contribution to overall Taiwanese energy use is pretty small. You can certainly argue that it was a serious mistake by Taiwan to opt for coal and gas instead of nuclear for its electricity, but that decision was made decades ago and would take further decades (and many billions of dollars) to reverse. Extending the operating licence for Maanshan would make very little difference. A much better bet for Taiwan would be investing in geothermal energy – the entire country is a major geothermal hotspot. What about a cable connection to the mainland? LOL A quick google search on Taiwan using geothermal came up with this “the island is very densely populated, and operational space is limited in many areas. In contrast, the less densely populated areas are very mountainous, which does not make a strong case for installing a rig either.” It goes on to be much more positive. United Airlines flight attendants stage a protest at the PR event launching a new business class seat. No contract in 5 years, lowest pay of major US airlines. Interesting to note that the 3 gulf carriers pay more than the US. @xJonNYC The FAs have their say at today’s UA new Polaris event They got arrested for trespassing. Hope they aren’t sent to El Salvador. >>>Boosting ICE budgets is bipartisan Polygraph I know that this view will be unpopular with the vast majority of the peeps… If you don’t like a law (eg, migration), repeal it. Selective enforcement is corrosive to society/govt legitimacy long-term. This term, your side doesn’t enforce migration laws. Next term, the other side stops enforcing environmental laws. “Ask for forgiveness (or look the other way), don’t ask for permission” (at all levels of society) is one of the 100 things destroying America’s social fabric. Be that as it may, the article in question is about the ICE BUDGET and the fact that it’s steady increases have been supported by both parties, regardless of who’s in power. So on THIS issue, the precise point is that “your side” and “their side” are the same, and that the alternation between parties makes no difference. I find the “Mission Creep” of ICE disturbing since all of us whose ancestors were not born here more than say, 500 years ago, are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. With some not especially creative “lawyering” this extends the jurisdiction of ICE, shall we say, rather broadly. Would that be a feature or a bug? Also note, the border czar … I believe that is his moniker … Homan was quoted, when challenged about some of his actions, “I was only following orders.” That defense was definitively shot down during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. I actually remember that, young though I was. Now you can question the Nuremberg trials and opn some grounds, I do. You can wonder why the borders have been wide open until you look at who hires and benefits from all that inexpensive labor. You can, as I did at the time, see the Patriot Act as among the worst of bad laws, and I do. Why you might ask? Did 17 or 27 …however many “intelligence” agencies there are … need another layer of bureaucracy troweled on top of them? I think not. Was the creation of national police forces … think ICE and others … never stop with just one … necessary? Depends on what plans, hopes, dreams, schemes, you have for them. As to your general points, could not agree more. What once was a government has become a shambles. Shambles: among whose definitions are disorder, ruin, clutter jumble and mess and finally a place of bloodshed or carnage. The OED would note it once referred to a slaughterhouse. (Apologies for the pedantic aside) The absence of long term planning or of follow through in the face of partisan one-up-man-ship, dueling lobbyists, and showers of “campaign contributions” in pursuit of access has reduced the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber to sound and silliness in pursuit of perpetuity in office by the unambitious and perpetuity in office and a small to medium fortune for the more bright eyed. But my cynicism overflows or is it realism? The result is visible this day as The Don as styled by Gay Talese in The Godfather, cavorts about the Arab states being showered with cash in one form or another ostensibly for public purposes, while his offspring and other relations hustle for the various family businesses. In the world of William Gibson’s The Peripheral this is called a Klept … you can look it up. Realism? Cynicism? Folly? Fantasy? Take you choice, but keep an eye on ICE. It’s not that your view is unpopular exactly it’s that it derives from what I believe is nostalgic unreality. Selective enforcement is the very nature of law in this country, has long been, and will ever be. The facade of rule of law has in my view largely been sundered not by the actual cavalier character of government (again, it was ever thus, sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception) but rather by the incredible diversity of media coverage possible in the 21st century which allows the sufficiently politically conscious to view every conceivable angle of policy and identify hypocrisies and inconsistencies at a level of granularity previously reserved for dedicated scholars. Indeed even the comparatively politically narcoleptic now live in such demographically stratified infospaces that it’s perfectly impossible not to perceive the comparative lawlessness of their political opposite. We once – before my lifetime so I take this as an article of faith – had a monoculture in news media that was capable of weaving a coherent throughline between any number of acts of brazen extralegal fiat such that the American public could digest it all. That is certainly not the case now and I cannot conceive of it ever being so again. Indeed, selective law enforcement is a common feature of all unfree societies where a few people rule over everyone else and forbid people from upholding their own laws. In free societies, everyone is expected to agree on and uphold their own laws and thus there are not exceptions like this. What Ironic is saying is true – it’s better to have societies where everyone agrees on rules that work for everybody. Otherwise people just argue over whose rules and enforcement preferences dominate. And of course the rich usually get their way. great, timely piece by historian Zachary Foster: https://palestinenexus.com/articles/jewish-antizionism It is a good overview, although slanted towards the English-speaking Jewish world in its last section: there is almost nothing about the current attitude of European (or South American) Jews towards zionism. I also found two intriguing articles by the same author on that site: How Zionists Prevented Jewish Refugees From Returning Home After WWII and Was Zionism about Rescuing Jews Fleeing Persecution? No. A further article confirms my earlier impression that the staunch support of Israel by the likes of Sunak, Meloni, Macron, Biden, Scholz, etc, is not due to any strategic advantage (economic, military, geographic, or otherwise), but because Israel is the country where Western countries, where antisemitism is latent, especially in right-wing circles, can dump their Jewish population. And if this happens to the detriment of Arabs, so what? “US Hypocrisy on Terrorism Reaches New Heights, While Trump Signals a Welcomed Shift in US Foreign Policy” I thought that Larry Johnson would be more stirred up about Trump with meeting Syria’s Jolani. That guy is basically an al-Qaeda leader and until recently had a $10 million bounty on his head by the US government. So I can see it now. Trump enters the room to meet Jolani who comes in with a trimmed beard, polished shoes, an expensive Rolex and a bespoke suit. The cameras are rolling for this historic event. Trump thinks to himself at least this is one leader that does not go around wearing t-shirts. As Jolani gets closer, he rips his jacket open to reveal sticks of dynamite, shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ before hugging Trump, then BOOM! Can you imagine? US’ side of the Shi’a-Sunni schism! Sunni terrorists, sustained by USA since 1980’s are the good guys. Trump in KSA is renewing US pledge to Arabian peninsula Wahabbi. As long as Sunnis in charge Israel is safe. Sell them new anti missile shield, golden dome for Medina! It’s really not the Sunnis at large but specifically Wahhabi Takfiri fighters funded by the Gulf despots and supported by US/Israeli deep state. They’ve been at it since 1970s Afghanistan, kicked it up a notch in the Balkans and then Chechyna, then Uyghurs, Iraq, Lybia, Syria, etc. Associating these predominantly Muslim murdering freaks with the bulk of Muslims is like associating Christian Zionists in Congress with all Christians. I think that Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia is perhaps the best I’ve seen give him. To be honest I can’t recall a better speech from a US president. Among items strengths, he’s gracious to the hosts, rather than lecturing them as other Western leaders like Biden or Baerbock would do. He’s acknowledging real strengths in the hosts, which is they built up gleaming cities, that they’re probably proud of themselves. He’s acknowledging real failures at home, the trillions wasted on Baghdad on Kabul and nation building there. Those cities would be better off without US nation building. And finally it reflects real recent policy changes. They’re lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria and they ended the idiotic attacks on Yemen. Honestly, I think a large percentage of the influence is how well they dress. And they let him touch the orb. He really enjoyed that! Agreed on the speech, but let’s see where he goes with it. On Syria, give a leg up to US’ “refined” terrorists. If IDF can kill Gazans new Syrian allies can kill non SUnni. Keeping in mind that Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize (2009) for making speeches and without making positive actions toward peace, I would say that Trump was following in Obama’s footsteps, considering one of Trump’s goals is receiving a Nobel. I’m afraid that starting a trade war with China, bombing civilians in Yemen, threatening Iran with a full-fledged attack, helping Israel commit a genocide in Gaza and keeping the war in the Ukraine going is not going to get him that Nobel peace prize. Not even if he regifts the Qatari jet to the Nobel committee? As proven by how they gave a Nobel to Obama before he even did anything, they are a cheap date. If I recall correctly, he did bomb the Moon. Perhaps we should encourage Trump to take still more bribes from the Arab countries if it means a correction of the long standing and senseless policy of favoring the 9 1/2 million Jewish Israelis over the triple digit millions who surround them. After all there has long been plenty of campaign bribery going on to further the anti Arab cause. In his recent talk with Judge Nap Alastair Crooke points out that the Cold War excuse for our ME policy was to keep the Soviets out of the Middle East. But the Cold War–mostly also senseless–is over despite neocons trying to revive it. FDR favored the Arabs while still asking them to accept Zionism. Truman on the other hand defied the advice of his State Department by siding with Israel. This policy mistake engendered all that has followed. At this point Israel isn’t going anywhere but for their own good someone needs to introduce them to reality. > he’s gracious to the hosts Because he wants $40 oil. Trump is a salesman. > lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria Abu Mohammed al-Jolani was a most wanted terrorist a few month ago. Now that he is in charge, so no more sanctions. Trump is no different, he is just doing “it” differently. The Don was being polite for a change, but he respects wealth and glitter, besides it costs nothing. In this case one can quote the nameless person who said of a political speech, “He talks purty, don’t he.” Obama rode “talkin’ purty” to the presidency then betrayed all, almost all(?) of his promises right out the gate. The Don wants a Nobel Peace prize because Obama received one and, i am convinced,The Don has never forgiven Obama for mocking him at the Press Club(?) dinner in DC in 2011. Vengeful persons neither forget nor forgive. Take this however you will. Churchill is quoted as saying, “When you are going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.” It is irritating to praise Trump for something like this but you’re not wrong if just regarding the content of the speech itself. Actually, more than irritating, it’s mortifying that this level of graciousness – what I would describe as completely reasonable and expected etiquette when one is a guest – is something laudable in the Western context. We’re grading on a frankly embarrassing curve. Trump’s speech suggested to me that the last person he spoke with before getting off the plane was Tulsi Gabbard. If so, good for both of them. I found this to be an interesting thread dissecting what Trump was banging on about … between Arnaud Bertrand and below commenter. Amine Idriss @amibiaka · 19h Arnaud, I see what you’re pointing to — but let’s not kid ourselves. Trump’s speech isn’t a breakthrough in appreciating civilizational diversity. It’s a classic expression of his white nationalist worldview, dressed up as respect for sovereignty. https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1922443275526668625 Arnaud’s core argument is – “Regarding Trump’s speech in Saudi, some see it as a refreshing break from liberal hypocrisy. I see it as something more dangerous, the normalization of a neo-mercantilist worldview. And that’s not a nostalgic return to realism; it’s a revival of the very ideology that once justified conquest, colonization, and the commodification of entire peoples. People in the West today complain about migration, as if it’s an invasion. But most of those who migrate to the West are fleeing the long-term consequences of Western imperialism, of resource extraction, of wars fought for oil or influence, of economic systems designed to benefit a few and impoverish the many. This doesn’t mean illegal immigration should be glorified. But let’s be honest: I have no sympathy for anti-immigrant rhetoric when it comes from the descendants of those who directly benefited from colonial plunder and racial capitalism.” – snip It seems to me that multipolarity is not unlike a global shit in the magnetic field, fluxes, and then bang it changes. How networks of power position themselves for it, with a side of climate change, is a sight to behold, as such I highly discount anything coming from Anglophone camp[see above] and especially anything coming from disingenuous Trump/camp[self serving]. “PM Modi Elaborates on S-400 Missile System’s Importance For India’s Air Defence: Why They Matter Now More Than Ever” How long until the US orders India to get rid of those S-400s because it is against US law for them to own them. And then to tell India to buy inferior Patriot batteries instead – which don’t exist at the moment – and to buy hundreds if not thousands of Patriot battery missiles – which have not even been manufactured yet. If India is lucky, they should get those Patriot batteries & missiles by 2040. You think that Pakistan will wait? The US doesn’t have that level of control over India. Might change in the future, but India is an important part of trying to contain China and because it has a conflict with China it also has more incentives to maintain relations with Russia. The Turks are much more vulnerable to pressure and have less reasons to keep Russia on side. India already has a domestic Patriot equivalent (medium range, up to around 150km), the Barak 8, which is jointly produced with Israel. Earlier reports indicated that India bought the S-400 specifically for the purposes of providing air defence over its borders with China – hence range and anti-stealth capability is particularly important. The recent possible failures in conflict with Pakistan may result in a rethink about where they are deployed. Mixing two separate systems is not considered good practice in air defence, so its a curious decision – presumably they have fallen behind in producing a Barak with the range to match the S-400. The big question, presumably well pondered by the Russians and Israelis, is how they stop each side getting access to key operational and technical inside information. If the systems can talk to each other – even if it be trough a third system – then it’s fine and dandy. Something akin to not having all your eggs in the same basket. But if the systems are isolated enough to basically fight alone, then they’re out-dated and handicapped even before they go operational. Allegedly Iran can take pretty much any air-defense system and make it work with their command, control, communication & situational awareness (C3/SA) network for air defense. “Illinois governor is first in US to block federal access to personal data on autism” Hey, Pritzker, why not block federal access to all personal data? Fourth amendment, anyone? Or does it apply only to corporate persons now? It’s funny how someone(s) is positioning/astroturfing Pritzker (billionaire, Dem. Machine scion) as a potential “Resistance” leader-2028 contender, see Jimmy Kimmel visit and Pritzker’s name popping up in random WaPo-NYt mentions. With friends like elite Democrats, who needs Republicans?! Pritzker, Slotkin and Buttigieg! Who says Ds don’t have a bench? (With JB, it had better be a sturdy one unless his consultants put him on Ozempic) Well, if the DemParty were to have a genuine democratic free Republican-quality primary for the first time in many years, we could see what shakes out. Or even get a vote on what shakes out. If . . . . No more down that path for me. I’m a veteran of McGovern in a small way, and recall how the Democrat Party not just abandoned a candidate, but actively allied against him. “Geonomics, nationalism and trade” This is why I decry the entire project to manufacture a divorce in the original term “political economy” into supposed “sciences” of each, an achievement of the unholy alliance of the marginalist school (Alfred Marshall being the foremost cementer of the ideas of Jevons, Menger and Walras) in economics and their Gilded Age funders in banking. It’s harmless enough in microeconomics, but intellectually lethal in macroeconomics — because in the latter “the politics never really went away.” It’s also why wherever international business investment went, gunboats inevitably followed … 🤨 “Qatar’s $400M jet for Trump is a gold-plated security nightmare” It doesn’t have to be. Trump could lease that 747 Jumbo jet back from the US government for a dollar a month while the government picks up the tab for the running expenses. He then announces that all those that own one of his Trump meme coins can go into a lottery to get a flight aboard this Jumbo jet for an hour or two. People would go out and buy & register one like they would with lottery tickets, especially MAGA supporters. Those that win would pay a $50 fee but that would be seen as cheap for a Trump flight and there would be no security issues at all. And is this so different to when recently top buyers of his coin could get a dinner with him? https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/top-buyers-trump-cryptocurrency-dinner It’s kind of amusing how even given Trump’s famously lax definition of ‘national security threats’ (the opioid crisis, illegal immigration, countries running a trade surplus with the US, the continued existence of Canada/Greenland as independent nations…) a Presidential plane supplied by a foreign power somehow doesn’t make the list. If you get behind on your payments on your Tesla, they can auto- drive your car back to the dealership. Makes me speculate that if Tesla can do that – then they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with Musk politics…..just speculating ya know – maybe a fun little sci-fi – a little data integration with siri, doorbells and all sorts of smart devices combined along with digital currency and Homeland security and police fusion centers…… why you could deport anybody you want with a self driving cab or car instead of iconviniencing ICE and the courts….you could knock off any opposition and disapear people at will….erase their identity and digital footprint or frame someone easy-peasy………..who needs to mess with that constitution or laws etc. Sounds about rite for the duopoly’s vision for Making America Great Again and Defending democracy…… I just wish they would tell me for whom they are defending democracy for and, for whom are they making America great Brings to mind the death of Michael Hastings, the journalist who got General Stanley McChrystal fired. During the morning’s brief channel surfing, I came across Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick lamenting the decline of ethics over the past couple of decades. For answers, they turned with all seriousness to their guest, Stanley McChrystal. Don’t change before the Empire falls. You’ll laugh so hard, you’ll crack the walls. Sometimes, I just miss the days when satire was a thing and not reality. Yes, I’ve kind of come to the conclusion that it woulnt matter whether Trump or some other clown was in the White House, we really are screwed. Trump just showed us the true nature of things. These tech billionaires own us and there is really nothing that can be done about it. Any of these jack asses, could set anyone up for a fall. And frankly with very little effort or evidence. And just who is gonna do anything About it? Anyone that thinks the courts or the press or the political class will help is deluded. Trump will have his plane, the USPS will be privatized, Social Security and medicare too. It’s all gone, along with our so called democracy. It done. That picture from Saudi Arabia was our future. Along with the list of billionaires. They own it and there nothing we can do about it. The democracy they are defending is the facade for what making America great again means. Simply great and democratic for them, not us. RE: “…they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with [insert elite name here] politics…” Very true! And you might enjoy the Terra Ignota scifi series where self-flying cars are a major plot point. Excerpt from the wiki entry – “The Six-Hive Transport System is a global network of flying cars, the primary mode of transportation in the series. They are fast enough to circle the globe in less than 4.2 hours, made possible by Cartesian set-sets. Mukta was the prototype car made in 2073 and now resides in the Saneer-Weeksbooth home. Utopia [a political faction] operates its own car system, separate to the primary one used in the series. The Utopian system is slightly slower than the primary one, but has 100% fewer accidents.” You will have to read the series (or at least the first two books which are great – the latter two are subpar) to find out why one political faction refuses to use the global transportation system. Suffice it to say that after reading the series, I will never be getting into any driverless car. Cars themselves will drive to the police station on detecting a non-white person in the driver’s seat? Regarding Guantanamo being re-purposed as a prison for migrants: Obama, when refusing to pursue criminal investigations against torture and other criminal acts at Guantanamo and elsewhere, said it was time to “look forward, not backward.” We now have a much clearer idea of what he meant. “RFK Jr. is full of crap” Somehow, looking at the images of RFK jr. taking his grandkids to go swim in those polluted waters, I am reminded of that 1975 film “Jaws.” The scene where people were on the beach but were not going into the water because of the recent shark attack. That is, until the local official leans on some older people to go into the water and when they do, they take their very young grandchildren with them into those waters. Don’t know why I thought of that old film… “Trump envoys Witkoff and Kellogg to go to Turkey for Russia-Ukraine talks, sources say” Those talks are going to go nowhere. Zelensky is trying to turn it into a media stunt by daring Putin to go there but what would they talk about? Zelenski’s 10-point peace plan? Kellogg, whose plan Trump has adopted, hopes Putin turns up. Even I know that negotiations don’t work that way and it is only after everything is settled that you call in the leaders to sign the agreements. Trump made himself sound like an idiot by indicting that he might just drop in to any meeting. Everybody knows that Presidents on Air Force One just drop in on random visits to countries from time to time to do a bit of shopping and maybe to pick up a pizza. The only reason why they want Putin there is to give him an ultimatum to freeze the conflict or else. Maybe even do to him what Trump and Vance did to Zelenski in that White House meeting several weeks ago. And Kellogg and others have said that as soon as there is a freeze, that they will flood the Ukraine with troops from at least four NATO nations. Looks like this war is going to be decided on the battlefield as Trump only wants negotiations so that Russia wins the war but loses the peace. And as it is now no longer Biden’s war but Trump’s war, the failure is all going to be on him. And all those neocons like Lindsay Graham will pretend that they were not pushing him but will blame Trump for not trying hard enough and which the media will go along with. I do not recall Witkoff or Kellogg being invited. Why send two persons with opposing views in the first place? Lavrov should, politely, tell them to bugger off. Trump should pull a page from Teddy Roosevelt. Invite Russia and Kiev to come to Portsmouth, NH. June is very nice in New England and the hotel from 1905 has been updated. The space at the shipyard may need polish. Bretton Woods is nice, too. “How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump” Let us treat this as the New Yorker’s bid for the Most Embarrassing Blame Deflection Award for 2025 (wittier name pending). At the moment the only other candidate is that ludicrous New York Times article which apparently informed us that Russia would’ve been roundly defeated in the special military operation but for the intransigence, incompetence, and possibly incontinence of the Ukrainian military brass; the academy is therefore actively seeking other submissions, as unsealing an envelope for a 50/50 chance isn’t nearly enough fun. When are we going to get the Pulitzer Award for Gaslighting? Or is that the standard Pulitzer nowadays? Oh I hate Donald Trump—-but hold my beer as I do everything in my power to get him re-elected! btw have your beer prices gone up? In my lovely native Bavaria hops harvest has serious shortages due to lack of water. Gooooooood Mooooooooorning Fiatnam! In the fetid QWERTY jungle online where the numismatrix plied its traits, it was all about the skill-ratio, if you could turn a lone greenback into 30 bucks vis a vis crypto, it was a lot better than being stuck with the pyramid scheme on the back of a FRN, and why doesn’t that eagle on the right have a phalanx of old glories behind it, with an artificial breeze fanning them? Regarding the Notes on the Crisis article on “Can China “Buy” America?”: in the 1980s I was tracking mergers and acquisitions as part of a group investigating how dirty money, after being laundered and brought back into the US, was buying up control of established companies. Back then, the major “public” worry was over the Japanese and what they would do with their rapidly growing trade surpluses. But the numbers on dollar amounts of mergers and acquisitions showed a much different reality. By far the largest amount in m&a was by “investors” from Britian and the British empire members of Australia and Canada. The Brits were usually at least three times larger than the Japanese. I was not surprised when legal probes a few years later identified HSBC (then known by its original imperial moniker the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) as one of the largest launderers of dirty money. HSBC — the infamous Hong Shang — of course, was originally established to process the revenue of the British opium trade out of China. “Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” The UK was a major legitimate investor abroad in the 80’s and the pool of safe countries for FDI.was much smaller. I don’t think the figures were directionally affected by corruption (but BCCI might have been part of it…). In HSBC’s defence, though, their crime was to purchase the extremely dodgy Republic Bank from Edmund Safra, which had a major NYC oresence and apparently zero KYC and AML controls! The US regulator fined them (HSBC) USD 12bn in exchange for a non-admission of guilt plea but in reality they inherited the crimes! Republic under Safra was suspected of tax evasion but also of other illegitimacies, in part because nobody could understand how low margin lending to governments and to physical goods trade could generate the profits claimed, especially when Republic employed very little leverage. The implication is that it was earning a vig on whatever its clients were doing. Given that Safra: – started out in physical shipments of cast. – was a Syrian-Lebanese New – lent to a lot of governments Safra died in a mysterious fire at his Monaco penthouse that was later judged arson…. PS: It is not surprising that fingers were pointed at Iran-contra type deals and drug money, a but like Alan Stanford. Here is an article very lamely pretending these was nothing crooked in public but leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. but it is not hard to read between the lines. https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-biography-probes-into-mysterious-backstory-of-billionaire-banker-edmond-j-safra/ Hunter Biden must be green with envy, the Biden’s only managed to Grift about $23MM total while the Donald’s Family has cleared well over $100MM from crypto alone and if you add the $400MM jet they are averaging better than $125MM a Month. In other happy news regular Gas is at $5.29 per Gallon, cash price at the local 76 station. That’s quite something to be able to gamble on the temperature of a city on a given day, why bother with mundane casinos? Gambling was fairly forbidden a century ago, and now nothing related to gambling is forbidden… heck, a couple of ballplayers who blackened the diamond by one throwing the world series for a gambler, and the other who gambled on games, were reinstated in the MLB yesterday, never mind. Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The Japanese prefecture of Fukushima is about 5,000 square miles in area, and remains mostly an abandoned area a decade after the reactor meltdown in the prefecture. I assume this will not change for another couple of hundred thousand years. The island of Taiwan is about 13,000 square miles in area, or perhaps two and a half times the size of the Fukushima prefecture. A single reactor catastrophe there on the scale of Fukushima will therefore, to a first approximation, make a half to a third of the island uninhabitable. It’s very easy to see why Taiwan is getting rid of nuclear power as fast as they can, though it doesn’t seem to be as fast as one would like. The mystery is why Japan isn’t doing the same thing. On the other hand, if Taiwan were converted into a nuclear wasteland, China and the US could stop fighting about its future and everyone could relax. I guess there really is a silver lining to every cloud. Fukushima Prefecture was wholly inappropriately abandoned. More people died from moving, upheaval and, in those who stayed, abandonment than could ever die of anthropogenic radiation exposure, especially in an elderly farming population. Sorry if this is a dumb question, was that incident really as dramatic as it was pictured in our (European) media or was it exaggerated or possibly even underplayed. For those curious, I took my avatar name here from the mascot of the Fukushima nuclear plant. For some strange reason they eliminated all reference to him from the internet around about 2011. It’s very hard to get a real grip on the true extent of damage, not least because the Japanese are very good at message control (aided by their ability to keep foreign experts at bay). The extreme radiation was very localised, and thankfully not much went airborne, unlike with Chernobyl. So Revenant is correct to say that the overall direct threat to anyone further than a few miles from the plant was pretty low – but certainly not negligible. But it is still a gigantic ticking bomb which will take many years of control to prevent any kind of chain reaction that could restart a reactor fire, or a major release of radioactivity to the sea (bioconcentration in seafood is ultimately a much bigger human health threat than airborne release). This is one (not the only) reason Taiwan then mothballed its new nuke plants. Taiwan is even more seismically active than Japan and prone to very extreme natural disasters. The scale of the Typhoons that regularly hit the island have to be seen to be believed. It complicates everything. Thanks. I remember that Fukushima was “used” by the Merkel administration to pull off their no-alternatives no-NPPs plan. So we now have basically no leeway in terms of energy production. Back then I argued with colleagues that regarding emissions by various sources it ought to be looked into the matter scientifically. Not ideologically. While that appears a very beginner´s approach for NC I bumped into some heavy resistance. As usual…thinking of the public atmosphere in those days – some even made movies about it… it´s the same insane, unreflected blind trust by the elite in their own media products. Self-serving, self-affirming, circular flow of information. Not much has changed since. Actually I wonder when was the period that this bubble-think became standard and dominant. So that Fukushima could be replaced by any other term. Of course those same circlces don´t even know any more what Fukushima is today. And these are often not bad people. It seriously upsetting Tons and tons of intensely radioactive congealed corium from three reactors is still stuck in the ground below the plants and will continue indefinitely to contaminate ground water. https://dunrenard.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/the-corium-of-reactor-2-of-fukushima-daiichi-is-clearly-visible/ FINALLY! I have been wondering for so many years where PlutoniumKun came from, it sounded Japanese but I wasn’t sure Trump takes a blow torch to the neocons and interventionists while speaking to the Saudis. I am no great admirer of Trump, but I challenge you to find a previous American president who would have said anything remotely similar to what Trump was saying here. Sounds like Noam Chomsky could have written this. Unfortunately, the overall effect was kind of ruined by the fact that on the same trip, he was selling US weaponry out the wazoo. But still… Franklin Delano Roosevelt?! The good neighbour idea? Are the Turks copying Israel with their effort to split PKK? Is Ocalan becoming an Arafat in old age? Are we oing to have a Hamas-PKK and a Fatah/PA-PKK? More like a parliamentary Sinn-Fein-PKK and an extra-parliamentary Provisional-PKK ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army Six cheetah cubs!

Although they all look so peeved in that photo, I wonder if they had substantial investments in Tesla or something . . . re: llamas I was mistyping an internet address and ended up with writing “cria” into google. As it turns out that is actually a scientific term derived from the Spanish word for “baby” also describing young specimen of llamas. See Wiki: Etymology The term comes from the Spanish word cría, meaning “baby”. Its false cognate in English, crya (pronounced /ˈkraɪə/), was coined by British sailors who explored Chile in the 18th century and were quick to describe the camelids onomatopoeically according to the mwa sound they made, which was not unlike that of a human crying baby. On the X post “we’ve really decided to let people gamble on the specific temperature…” How do you determine a specific temperature of any town? This seems like a big “So what?” to me. If you check ambientweather.net you’ll see most towns have a pretty wide variance in temps.

Title: Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. The Brother Lode: Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which the SEC recently greenlit to be listed on the NYSE. After a decade-long beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, are the company’s largest shareholders through their holding company J&F Investimentos. The brothers, whom Forbes estimates are worth $4.8 billion each, have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed for about six months from 2017 to 2018. Any one of those issues would have ended most other companies’ prospects of going public on the American market, but following the SEC’s recent decision, JBS is looking to offer shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, pending a shareholder vote later this month. “This time it looks like it’s for real,” says Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, which is not involved in the listing. Over the past two decades, the Batista brothers have turned their family’s South American meat business into a goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue with a presence in nearly every country in the world. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Angus Beef. But given the mountain of scandals, U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have long been opposed to the company going public in America. Just last year, at 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. For years, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics. In 2019 Rubio requested an investigation by a Treasury Department committee into JBS’s acquisitions, and in 2021, he renewed the ask and broadened it to the approximately 250 meat and agribusiness companies owned by the Batista family’s holding company J&F Investimentos. The Treasury Department declined to comment. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight.” But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump retuned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation: “No company has control over the timing of when inaugural committee donation contributions are publicized, and the JBS listing has been underway for approximately two years. The company has internal controls and compliance procedures in place to ensure that all political contributions are made in a transparent and ethical manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” The spokesperson also declined to provide the names of executives at the Inauguration, only confirming “several executives attended inaugural events.” The representative declined to comment on whether JBS, Pilgrim’s Pride or any affiliates donated to the Trump Administration’s transition fund from last summer. In addition to the SEC approval, there have been other federal policy changes in President Trump’s first 100 days that have benefited JBS and the Batistas—most notably, the administration’s decision to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law, which dates back to 1977, prohibits U.S. companies (including subsidiaries owned by foreign companies), citizens, as well as foreigners acting in the U.S., from bribing officials in the U.S. or abroad. It had previously led to JBS parent company J&F Investimentos paying a $128 million criminal fine as part of a 2020 settlement with the Department of Justice in which J&F pleaded guilty to corruption charges. J&F also paid nearly $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC in 2020. At the same time, the Batistas, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. JBS’ spokesperson says that the Trump Administration’s decision “didn’t change any of the obligations contained in J&F’s settlement, which have been fully complied with.” In terms of linking the SEC’s change of heart about JBS’ listing to donations to Trump’s inaugural, it’s difficult to prove a quid pro quo in court, says Brett Kappel, a campaign finance and government ethics attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harmon Curran, and it’s unlikely a prosecutor would even take the case. “If there were a prosecution, the Justice Department would have to show that there was an agreement that government officials would do certain things in exchange for the contribution,” Kappel says. Although he adds, “the Justice Department could show through circumstantial evidence that the two things were linked. In our judicial system we trust juries to use their common sense to make those decisions." JBS denies any quid pro quo. “As a U.S.-based food company, Pilgrim’s Pride was pleased to support the 2025 inauguration ceremony,” the spokesperson says. “We have a long bipartisan history of participating in the civic process and look forward to working with the Administration to create opportunities for American farmers and provide safe, affordable food for American families.” JBS was founded in 1953 when then-19-year-old Jose Batista Sobrinho, the namesake of the company, began carving up oxen and selling the meat to locals around the family’s small farm in Anapolis, a rural region in Central Brazil. Joesley and Wesley were born into the family business as Brazilian beef started booming in the 1970s. The brothers dropped out of high school to work full-time for JBS, by then a major Brazilian meatpacker, which was then run by Jose Batista, their eldest brother. But in 2005, Jose left JBS for an ill-fated attempt at politics and Joesley and Wesley, then in their thirties, took over. They took JBS public at a valuation equivalent to $800 million on Brazil’s São Paolo-based B3 stock exchange in 2007, which was at the time the most successful debut in the history of its stock market. Soon after going public, the Batistas looked to supersize their business by taking JBS abroad. The Batistas, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission cease-and-desist order from 2020, were willing to buy their way in. According to his testimony to Brazilian investigators in 2017, Joesley had a network of government officials and politicians on his payroll, including a finance minister at the Brazilian development bank BNDES, who received kickbacks for helping finance acquisitions of American assets, including Pilgrim’s Pride. (BNDES, which also became JBS’ second-largest shareholder, has denied allegations of corruption and bribery, citing an independent investigation at the time that found no evidence. A Brazilian federal court also refused to charge JBS with a crime in connection with the bribery.) After Texas-based Pilgrim’s Pride went bankrupt, in 2009 the Batistas targeted America’s second-largest chicken processor, which they viewed as a bargain. For an initial 64% of the company, JBS spent $800 million. The deal had an enterprise value of $2.8 billion with BNDES providing $2 billion in financing. According to the DOJ indictment against J&F, the bribe Joesley Batista deposited into a U.S. bank account for the BNDES finance minister was more than $55 million. JBS eventually secured an estimated nearly $5 billion in total equity and debt financing from BNDES across several U.S. deals, including Pilgrim’s Pride. In all, the Batistas and J&F agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. The DOJ and SEC found evidence of some $150 million in kickbacks. According to the SEC’s 2020 case against JBS, publicly traded Pilgrim’s Pride, which the Batistas eventually amassed an 80% stake in, even became a slush fund for the brothers: “From 2009 to 2015, unbeknownst to Pilgrim’s management, the [Batistas and J&F] carried out the bribery scheme and its funding using, at times, certain JBS operating accounts which contained funds that were commingled with funds obtained from Pilgrim’s through intercompany transfers, special dividend payments, and other means. Pilgrim’s books did not reflect this.” The scheme came crashing down when Brazilian investigators, in the middle of a sweeping country-wide corruption probe in 2017, had Joesley Batista wear a wire to snare the then-President of Brazil, Michel Temer, who Joesley alleged was on the Batistas’ payroll. On the recording, Temer can be heard discussing Joesley giving a bribe to another politician on Temer’s behalf. After the recording leaked, the Brazilian real tanked and there were massive street protests in Brazil. Despite their cooperation, the Batistas didn’t avoid jail time—they ended up serving about six months, starting in September 2017. And as these bribes, and other unrelated bribes to meat inspectors in Brazil, were revealed to the public, their attempts to list JBS in the U.S. were delayed. “There were some rocky years there,” says John Baumgarten, a managing director at Mizuho Group who covers food companies, including JBS. “They had to take a few steps backwards.” In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon. JBS’ spokesperson denies that, and says the company is “deeply committed to zero deforestation in our supply chain and are actively investing in sustainable agricultural practices. We continue to collaborate with our suppliers to promote responsible land use and reduce our shared environmental footprint.” But representatives of the Parakanã people in Brazil allege that JBS illegally exploited the Apyterewa Indigenous Territory in the rainforest by buying cattle raised on cleared acres. According to a letter sent to then-SEC chairman Gary Gensler in 2023 asking for the listing to be blocked, which was obtained by Forbes through a Freedom of Information Act request, community leader Wenatoa said “Our people suffer daily threats from invaders, and JBS is an accomplice in this invasion…We will not be silent as long as our lands, culture and dignity continue to be harmed by irresponsible business practices like this.” Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with HSBC’s Laboy estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” Overall, Laboy sees the listing as a way to rein in JBS. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight,” he says. “More oversight of the market leader intensifies the regulatory pressure on bad behavior in the broader industry." Either way, the Batistas are not going anywhere. Once JBS is listed, the family holding companies, J&F and JBS Participações, which owns nearly 50% as the largest shareholder of JBS, will get the chance to convert its common shares to preferred, increasing the Batistas’ voting power to as much as 90%. While JBS declined to comment on the Batistas’ long-term plans, the move ensures that the family will be involved for years to come. Because of that family control, Laboy believes that “strong independent voices on the board of directors” are a must. But, as it stands, the board of directors under the NYSE-listed company will include Joesley and Wesley Batista, who were forced to leave the board when they were arrested in 2017. They had been banned from leadership roles for years but they both returned to management at J&F in 2020 after a Brazilian judge ordered it, and in 2024 they were both reelected to the JBS board. “A strong board with independent members of unquestionable integrity would be optimal for all shareholders of JBS,” Laboy adds, “including [the Batistas].”

Title: Microsoft hasn’t bowed to Trump — and the company is thriving

Ever since Donald J. Trump was re-elected president, we’ve witnessed a disheartening spectacle: big tech companies bending their knees to him, hoping to get him to kill antitrust actions against them and defend them from European Union rules and fines. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook have all in one way or another shown or declared support for the president’s agenda, especially his opposition to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs. Notably, all four attended his Jan. 20 inauguration and were front and center during the proceedings. Zuckerberg killed DEI efforts at Meta, abandoned attempts to contain misinformation on his services, makes regular pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and called then-candidate Trump a “badass” after last year’s assassination attempt. He sounded like nothing so much as Trump himself (while using words of more than one syllable) when he told Joe Rogan on a podcast: “The corporate world is pretty culturally neutered. A culture that celebrates aggression a bit more has its own merits. Masculine energy, I think, is good.” Bezos killed DEI at Amazon. As the owner of The Washington Post he also squashed the newspaper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, killed a cartoon of tech leaders and Mickey Mouse bowing down to Trump, and ruled that the paper’s editorial and opinion pages will become right-wing, covering only “personal liberty and free markets,” with no opposing viewpoints allowed. Pichai killed off DEI efforts at Google and makes regular visits to see Trump in Florida. Cook is a bit of an outlier — although he attended the inauguration, he didn’t kill DEI at Apple and has made noises about working with Trump on tariff issues. The four companies haven’t gotten anything (yet) for their efforts; legal action against them begun under Trump’s predecessor are proceeding. Google faces being broken up after a judge ruled it illegally monopolized the advertising tech market. Meta is being prosecuted for illegally monopolizing the social media market by buying Instagram and What’s App and could be broken up as well. Amazon has been charged by the FTC with protecting its online retail monopoly by imposing fees on third-party sellers and favoring its own services over theirs. Apple has been sued by the Department of Justice for a variety of antitrust actions in protecting and extending its monopoly in the smartphone market. And while Trump has made statements about EU regulators — the White House last month criticized recent fines against Meta and Apple as a “novel form of economic extortion” — but has done little to get the EU to halt its actions against the companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft not only won’t valorize Trump, it’s also pushing back against him. The company has publicly supported its DEI efforts rather than killing them. In December, the company’s Chief Diversity Officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyr, wrote on LinkedIn that Microsoft’s DEI efforts are vital to the company’s success: “The business case for D&I [diversity and inclusion] is not only a constant, but is stronger than ever, reinforcing our belief that a diverse and inclusive workforce is crucial for innovation and success.” When worries surfaced that Trump might require American tech companies to suspend their cloud operations in Europe, or turn Europeans’ data over to the federal government as part of a trade war, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that he won’t turn over the data or suspend European cloud operations. In fact, he said the company is expanding them. He also said he would sue the Trump administration to protect them, if necessary. Two days after that, Microsoft dropped the big law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which had agreed to give the administration $125 million in free legal work after threats from Trump. Microsoft hired Jenner & Block to take its place — and Jenner & Block sued the Trump administration instead of giving in to it. You might expect that after all that, Trump would have publicly attacked Microsoft or used the power of his office to go after the company. So far, that hasn’t happened. And unlike Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has thrived since Trump took office. Its stock price inched up from $434 a share just before Trump’s inauguration past $445 this week, while the share prices of the others have all declined, sometimes significantly. Along the way, Microsoft became the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap approaching $3.3 trillion. Gauging by the company’s most recent quarterly results, even better times may be ahead. The New York Times had this to say about the results: “Overall, Microsoft’s results showed unexpected strength in its business. Sales surpassed $70 billion, up 13% from the same period a year earlier. Profit rose to $25.8 billion, up 18%. The results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Despite the economic uncertainty, the company predicted more strength ahead, saying revenue would surpass $73 billion in the current quarter.” All that said, Microsoft is being investigated by the feds for possible antitrust violations having to do with AI and cloud computing. That investigation, like the others, wasn’t begun by the Trump administration; it was set in motion during the Biden administration. So far, Microsoft’s actions don’t appear to have had any effect on the suit — or the company. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shown that it’s possible for a company to maintain its values under Trump and thrive. Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta should follow suit.

Title: Microsoft Layoffs Impact 7,000 Workers As Company Adjusts For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/05/13/microsoft-layoffs-impact-7000-workers-as-company-adjusts-for-ai/

ByChris Westfall ByChris Westfall, Contributor. Layoffs driven by AI investment will effect more than 6,000 employees. In a move signaling a significant strategic pivot, Microsoft today announced a reduction of its workforce by more than 6,000 employees, representing about 3% of its total headcount. While such news often triggers concerns about automation and job displacement due to artificial intelligence, the company indicated a different rationale: This adjustment is a calculated step to optimize resources and ensure continued robust investment in Microsoft’s burgeoning AI platform. The decision to streamline certain operations (and create bottom-line impact) is designed to free up capital to drive the company’s AI-centric strategy. “We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly," the company has previously shared on its website. Reuters reports that it is this investment in new AI initiatives, not the AI technology itself, that has caused the company to reduce its staff. However, CEO Satya Nadella told a Silicon Valley audience that “maybe 20, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today, and some of our projects, are probably all written by software.” In that same conversation, on stage with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nadella described his vision for Microsoft as a ”distillation factory", where they would take large, general purpose AI models and shrink them down into smaller, specialized and even task-specific models. Nadella has often spoken of the “democratization of AI” and his plans for the technology. Indeed, efforts are underway to target businesses with AI-powered tools and platforms, as the company embeds AI capabilities into mainstay products like Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics365. And Wall Street has responded in a positive way. Microsoft’s gross profit margins have consistently been in the high 60’s-low 70% range over the last few years, making the stock a favorite for institutional investors. On Monday, Microsoft shares ended trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. (They closed at a record $467.56 last July). The company recently reported quarterly revenues of $70.07 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. For comparison, Nadella has said the company will spend $80 billion in fiscal year 2025 on AI-related efforts. Analyst Gil Luria says that headcount reduction is a natural result of those kinds of capital investment numbers, hinting that more layoffs might be ahead. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000 in order to make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures,” Luria said, according to Reuters. The displaced workforce includes about 1,985 workers in Washington state, where the company is headquartered. Overall, there are 228,000 workers at the company. The layoff news for these laid off workers can’t be easy, as the trend in tech layoffs continues. Corrected, May 14: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Microsoft employees likely to be cut; it’s more than 6,000, or less than 3% of the company’s workforce.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI, written in Golang An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI command, written in Golang. Install unified from go: Set your UniFi API key Try it out: If all goes well, you should see something like: Note that the output is valid JSON, just like the UniFi applications produce. --debug is a helpful flag if you'd like to see more information about unified's operation. Log output is printed to stderr by default. This way logging doesn't interfere with parsing of unified's regular stdout output. unified has a full help system accessible through the --help flag. To access the Network API you will use: and for the Protect API use: unified can be configured via a yaml file: Which can be located at any of the following: Or you can manually specify which config file to use with the --config flag. Learn how to generate an API key from UniFi's official documentation. Network and Protect are "Local Applications". Warning Your API key is a sensitive secret! Please keep it securely stored. It gives FULL API access to your UniFi applications. If you need to revoke an API key navigate to your UniFi application and then to your Admin user: Settings -> Admins & User -> Select Admin account associated with the API key -> Click on API Key -> Remove. You can always generate a new API key if necessary. Now, you can pass your API key to unified in one of two ways: To instantiate a client you should call client.NewClient: Access to actual API client calls is mediated through NetworkV1 and ProtectV1 interfaces. Like so: These interfaces strive to closely mirror the actual APIs exposed by the Network and Protect applications. Protect's API has a couple of interesting endpoints which allow a client to subscribe to a Websocket event stream. The ProtectV1 interface exposes a pair of methods which provide easy access to those streams as golang channels: and while it's certainly do-able to consume those event channels, unified also provides a handler for each event type that makes consuming and re-acting to these events even easier. Here's a brief example of using ProtectEventStreamHandler: A nearly-identical struct exists to handle ProtectDeviceEvents: ProtectDeviceEventStreamHandler. doorbell.go is a full example of using a stream handler. Example programs can be built via: Full Protect API support is planned in short order. After the initial versioned release of this project, work will proceed towards full Protect V1 API support. As well as a full v1.0.0 release. Reference documentation through godoc is also a priority before a v1.0.0 release. Access API might be supported in a future release. Contributions welcome here. Unifi's provided TLS certificates are self-signed and do not sign for the unifi hostname. They do sign for unifi.local, but the default DNS configuration for my UDM Pro does not seem to add an entry for unifi.local. Therefore TLS verification generally fails when https protocol connections are attemped. unified defaults to TLS verification being off. In short, at least two general issues need to be solved to enable TLS verification by default: I'd like to find an easy way to solve these two issues and re-enable TLS verification by default before a full v1.0.0 release. UniFi Network API V1 is fully supported as of Network application version "9.1.120". UniFi Protect API is partially supported, with the following endpoints supported: The rest of the Protect API is TODO, but coming shortly. UniFi Access API is not yet supported. Contributions are welcome! Before submiting any PRs, please ensure your commits build and lint. Also, take care to test any changes, and ideally submit unit tests or integration tests which cover your changes. PRs must pass all CI in order to be considered acceptable to merge. If you'd like to contribute a feature or API support that doesn't yet exist, please communicate your intention through a new or existing GitHub issue. Let's try to avoid duplicating work, and make sure the work aligns with project goals. If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub issues. The more descriptive you can be, the better.

Title: U.S.-China Tariff Thaw Sparks Stock Rally—Making Bezos, Musk And Zuckerberg More Than $40 Billion Richer

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks surged across the board Monday as the U.S. and China’s trade war deescalated significantly, and the most valuable American companies largely slumping from the Beijing vs. Washington standoff roared back to life. Stocks surged Monday after a "dream scenario" for bulls emerged out of this weekend's U.S.-China ... More talks. This weekend’s talks between Washington and Beijing officials in Geneva culminated in both countries cutting their tariff for at least the next 90 days, with the U.S. slashing its duties on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China cutting its levies on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. That led to a surge in global stocks as the most concrete evidence yet of Washington backing down from its most stark trade war plans, as the Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong-listed stocks soared 3% in Monday trading, with similar gains across U.S. indexes. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 2.8%, or 1,160 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 3.3% and tech-concentrated Nasdaq ripped forward 4.4%. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closed at their highest levels since March 26, March 3 and Feb. 28, respectively. Leading the charge were the tech behemoths perhaps most reliant on a symbiotic relationship with the U.S. and China, as shares of Amazon (up 8%), Apple (6%), Nvidia (5%) and Tesla (7%) all outperformed the broader market. Also rallying were the stocks of fellow “magnificent seven” constituents Alphabet (3%), Meta (8%) and Microsoft (2%). $830 billion. That’s about how much market capitalization the aforementioned seven tech giants added Monday, led by Apple, Amazon and Nvidia’s more than $150 billion respective surges. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company surpassed a $1 trillion valuation for the first time since late February during Monday’s rally. Tesla’s roughly $320 share price is still below its all-time high of nearly $490 set in December as investors flooded into the stock in anticipation of what Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration may mean for his company. Already the richest person in the world, Musk enjoyed an $11 billion bump to his net worth as Tesla shares rallied, extending his fortune to $407 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimates. The planet’s second-wealthiest person Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Earth’s third-richest person Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg enjoyed $14 billion and $16 billion respective net worth bumps, though both men are still more than $180 billion poorer than Musk. The U.S.-China deescalation was a “huge win for the bulls,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday note to clients, saying the dramatic lowering of tariffs was a “dream scenario” for the U.S. tech industry. As investors fled into riskier stocks, assets viewed as safe havens from the tariff-induced market slump struggled. Gold prices tumbled 3% to below $3,240 per troy ounce, the lowest level since April 10 and the largest single-day loss since November. Yields for 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes spiked by about 10 basis points apiece Monday, with the higher yields signifying less valuable bonds as the safe returns of Treasuries prove less appealing in a more friendly operating environment for public companies. The S&P is up almost 20% from its early April nadir, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s first tariff blink, but the U.S. equity yardstick is still down 3% since Trump’s January inauguration. Trump campaigned on raising tariffs and targeted Canada, China and Mexico with country-specific actions in his first two months, but the country-by-country tariffs he laid out during his April 2 “Liberation Day” event were far more hawkish than Wall Street anticipated. The S&P tanked 12% in the five trading sessions following that speech, which led to a chorus of economists warning the sudden, sharp rise in import costs could send the U.S. into an avoidable recession. Trump began to loosen his tariff belt April 9 when he paused much of the most severe duties for 90 days, though he didn’t show much leeway on Chinese levies until last week, when he floated an 80% tariff on Chinese goods, nearly three times as severe as the rate announced Monday. Apple, Nvidia and Tesla are among the American companies with the heaviest revenue exposure to China, which accounted for at least 17% of each of those companies’ 2024 sales, while Amazon relies on China as half of its third-party sellers originate from the country. Public companies mentioned “tariffs” on earnings calls this quarter more than twice as much as they did during any quarter in Trump’s first term, according to Morgan Stanley research, evidence of the more heightened concerns on bottom lines from this round of tariffs.

Title: Time To Buy META Stock After The U.S. China Trade Deal?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2025/05/02: Meta logo is seen at their stall during the World Audio ... More Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) event in Mumbai. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Following positive developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations, Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) is trending upward, showing a 7% gain in pre-market trading. This surge is likely driven by the announcement that both nations have agreed to a 90-day pause on tariff increases and a significant reduction in existing tariff levels. Specifically, reciprocal tariffs are set to decrease by 115%, from the current 125% to 10%. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on Meta Platforms. Meta's business model necessitates significant infrastructure scaling to support its algorithms, power Reels, and advance its growing AI capabilities. Higher tariffs would have increased the cost of this infrastructure development. Coupled with anxieties regarding a possible pullback in advertising spending, this created a worrisome outlook for the company. However, the newly announced 90-day tariff pause is being viewed favorably by investors, alleviating some of these immediate concerns. Furthermore, the substantial tariff reduction signals a potential breakthrough in trade discussions, indicating a shared desire to ease trade tensions. Market attention will now turn to whether this development signifies the start of a more comprehensive and lasting trade agreement. Also, see – Is The U.S.-China Trade War Over? Beyond these macroeconomic factors, META stock appears to be an attractive investment at its current pre-market price of approximately $630. We believe that the concerns surrounding META stock are currently minimal, making its high valuation justified. Our positive assessment is based on a comparison of META's present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that Meta Platforms exhibits very strong operating performance and a robust financial condition, as will be detailed subsequently. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Will AI Really Disrupt Google’s Search Empire? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms' profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: META stock demonstrated strong performance across the key parameters we analyzed. While its valuation of 9.7x trailing revenues is on the higher end, this appears justified by its accelerating sales growth and improving profitability. In light of these strong fundamentals, and now considering the positive momentum generated by the U.S.-China trade talk developments and the 90-day tariff pause, we believe that META stock still presents a compelling buying opportunity for substantial long-term gains. While META stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
