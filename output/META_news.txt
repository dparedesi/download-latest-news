We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. I was wrong, as it turns out, about Elon Musk. At least on this occasion. A year ago, I’d predicted that Musk would quit Tesla. It was a bold prediction but one backed with evidence: Sales of Tesla’s electric cars fell in 2025, the first annual decline in more than a decade, and for the billionaire to be juggling roles leading X, Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, the Boring Company and Neuralink seemed unsustainable. I thought that the incessant tweeting, the controversies and constant outrages, the demanding role in Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and a decline in vehicle sales would all collectively catch up to Musk. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for Musk’s successor. Credit: Bloomberg “After constant controversies and distractions, it will all come to a head in 2025, and Musk will be forced to hand over the reins at Tesla, a company many mistakenly think he founded,” I wrote. Musk hit back. “I predict that the Sydney Morning Herald will continue to lose readership in 2025 for relentlessly lying to their audience and boring them to death,” he wrote in response to a screenshot of my article posted by one of his followers. Elon Musk’s tweet predicting a difficult year for the Sydney Morning Herald.Credit: Twitter Elon was wrong. Statistics from Roy Morgan show the Sydney Morning Herald grew its total readership by 11 per cent in 2025. I too, was wrong. But I was oh so close to being right. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for his successor. “Board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next chief executive, according to people familiar with the discussions,” the newspaper reported. Tesla’s eight-person board, which is chaired by Australian businesswoman Robyn Denholm, denied the accuracy of that report and ultimately went the other way. They issued Musk the largest CEO pay deal ever - a stock-based compensation plan that could be worth close to $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) over roughly a decade - a move designed to keep Musk focused on Tesla rather than shifting his attention elsewhere. Tesla’s chairperson Robyn Denholm said Elon Musk was a “generational leader” and the right CEO during this “transformative period of time.”Credit: Bloomberg So, I maintain that I was on the money with my prediction that Elon’s controversies, distractions and workload were unsustainable. But he didn’t quit Tesla. What about my other predictions? Virtual reality having another year of unfulfilled promise, seems largely accurate. By Apple’s usual standards, sales of its $5999 Vision Pro VR headsets have clearly fallen short of expectations, with the company reportedly selling hundreds of thousands fewer than it had anticipated. Tick. I predicted crypto would soar and bitcoin would surpass $US200,000 - wrong there - and my prediction of an ‘AI winter’ beginning was also off, with AI stocks like Nvidia and others staying hot. Flying cars have also not taken off. They remain decidedly grounded. Some of my other stray predictions seem spot on. It’s early days, but Australia’s teen social media ban has indeed been largely successful so far, with other countries taking notice, and Trump’s tariffs have hit electronics prices. There was no major AI deepfake reported in Australia’s federal election, however. Here are seven predictions for 2026. I’ll probably get half of them wrong. But the fun is in the guessing. The ingredients are all there. Government agencies are rushing to deploy AI for “efficiency.” Corporations are automating decisions about loans, insurance, hiring, and welfare. And Australia’s track record on algorithmic accountability - Robodebt, anyone? - suggests the guardrails aren’t up to the task. The scandal could take several forms: a Services Australia AI that wrongly denies benefits to thousands of vulnerable people; a major employer’s hiring algorithm found to systematically discriminate; a health insurer using AI to deny claims based on race or income ... AI will inevitably stuff up somewhere, the only question is which sector gets caught first. Remember how everyone mocked Google Glass? Meta’s smart glasses are proving that the tech industry’s first instinct - wear a computer on your face - wasn’t wrong, just premature. The difference is in form factor and social acceptability. These actually look like normal sunglasses. You don’t look like a tech bro uberdork wearing them to the pub. And with AI features built in, they’re genuinely useful: real-time translation, object identification (ask them: ‘What am I looking at?’), hands-free messaging, and navigation that doesn’t require you to stare at your phone while walking into traffic. Meta Platforms is seeking to turn its burgeoning smart glasses into a must-have product.Credit: Bloomberg The 2026 iteration will likely add a subtle heads-up display, and that’s when things get interesting. Apple is reportedly working on its own version, which will legitimise the category further. This won’t be VR-style hype, it’ll be more of a slow burn. But by year’s end, smart glasses will be the wearable that actually sticks, succeeding where VR flopped. BYD already outsells Tesla in Australia in some months, and that’s just the beginning. The Chinese manufacturer - along with MG, GWM, and newcomers like Zeekr and Xiaomi - are flooding the market with competent, affordable EVs that legacy carmakers simply can’t match on price. BYD electric vehicles parked in a private storage yard in Kilsyth in Melbourne’s east.Credit: Aaron Francis Australia seems uniquely vulnerable to some of these dynamics: we have no local car manufacturing left, and consumers are historically happy to buy whatever’s cheapest. Tesla’s brand remains politically toxic to some buyers thanks to Musk’s antics, and Ford and Toyota are still playing catch-up when it comes to EVs at scale. By the end of 2026, Chinese manufacturers will command between 30 and 40 per cent of Australia’s EV market, and nobody in Canberra will quite know what to do about it. Nvidia has been the undisputed king of the AI boom. Its processors are the pickaxes in a gold rush that sent its market cap past $US3 trillion. But 2026 is when gravity reasserts itself. Giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are all developing custom AI chips to reduce their dependency on Nvidia, whose sky-high share price has long seemed almost impossible to justify. Critically, the AI infrastructure spending spree can’t continue at this rate forever. At some point, companies need to see returns. This doesn’t mean that Nvidia becomes irrelevant. It just means that its era of unquestioned dominance - and its title as the Most Important Company In The World - ends in 2026. Quantum computing is - maybe - set for a breakout year.Credit: PsiQuantum Quantum computing has been ‘five years away’ for every year I’ve been reporting on the industry. But Google’s Willow chip and IBM’s steady progress on error correction suggest we’re approaching a genuine inflection point. The breakthrough won’t be quantum computers replacing your laptop. It’ll be a clear demonstration of quantum advantage on a problem that actually matters: think simulating a molecule for drug discovery, or cracking an encryption protocol (which will terrify everyone). When it happens, every CEO will suddenly need a ‘quantum strategy’ and start-ups will raise billions on pitch decks that don’t make sense. Most of the hype will be largely premature, just as it was with AI in 2023, but the narrative will shift permanently. Quantum will go from ‘interesting science experiment’ to ‘inevitable technology disruption’ next year. After Optus, Medibank, Latitude, and a parade of smaller breaches, the statistical reality is grim: Australia’s big four banks are operating on borrowed time. They’re attractive targets: massive repositories of sensitive financial data, legacy systems that are barely held together and complex supply chains with countless potential entry points. Australia’s banks have invested heavily in security, but so have every other company that’s been breached. It only takes one missed patch, one phished employee, or one compromised vendor for the worst to happen. And when it does happen, the fallout will be nuclear. Banking data is more sensitive than telco records. The political response will be severe, potentially including personal liability for executives and board members who failed to prioritise security, and regulators like APRA may come into the firing line. The silver lining is that it might be the shock that forces an overhaul of Australia’s approach to cybersecurity, from mandatory breach disclosure timelines to more severe penalties for negligence. The Melanie Perkins-led company times its listing perfectly, riding renewed appetite for profitable tech. Its AI design tools are a moat rather than a commodity, and enterprise adoption accelerates as marketing teams ditch expensive Adobe subscriptions.

Hundreds of new millionaires - many of whom are the company’s early employees - are minted in the process, unlocking a tidal wave of capital. An AI-written song tops the charts; a prominent Australian influencer is exposed as largely AI-generated; Google’s search dominance faces its first real threat in decades. Copyright © 2025

Title: AI Stands for Accidental Innovation

LAST UPDATED: December 29, 2025 at 12:49 PM GUEST POST from Art Inteligencia In the world of corporate strategy, we love to manufacture myths of inevitable visionary genius. We look at the behemoths of today and assume their current dominance was etched in stone a decade ago by a leader who could see through the fog of time. But as someone who has spent a career studying Human-Centered Innovation and the mechanics of innovation, I can tell you that the reality is often much messier. And this is no different when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), so much so that it could be said that AI stands for Accidental Innovation. Take, for instance, the meteoric rise of Nvidia. Today, they are the undisputed architects of the intelligence age, a company whose hardware powers the Large Language Models (LLMs) reshaping our world. Yet, if we pull back the curtain, we find a story of survival, near-acquisitions, and a heavy dose of serendipity. Nvidia didn’t build their current empire because they predicted the exact nuances of the generative AI explosion; they built it because they were lucky enough to have developed technology for a completely different purpose that happened to be the perfect fuel for the AI fire. — Braden Kelley It is difficult to imagine now, but there was a point in the Future Present where Nvidia was seen as a vulnerable hardware player. In the mid-2010s, as the Virtual Reality (VR) hype began to peak, Nvidia’s focus was heavily tethered to the gaming market. Internal histories and industry whispers suggest that the Oculus division of Meta (then Facebook) explored the idea of acquiring or deeply merging with Nvidia’s core graphics capabilities to secure their own hardware vertical. At the time, Nvidia’s valuation was a fraction of what it is today. Had that acquisition occurred, the “Corporate Antibodies” of a social media giant would likely have stifled the very modularity that makes Nvidia great today. Instead of becoming the generic compute engine for the world, Nvidia might have been optimized—and narrowed—into a specialized silicon shop for VR headsets. It was a sliding doors moment for the entire tech industry. By not being acquired, Nvidia maintained the autonomy to follow the scent of demand wherever it led next. Before the “Magnificent Seven” era, Nvidia was struggling to find its next big act beyond PC gaming. When Meta acquired Oculus, there was a desperate need for low-latency, high-performance GPUs to make VR viable. The relationship between the two companies was so symbiotic that some analysts argued a vertical integration was the only logical step. Had Mark Zuckerberg moved more aggressively to bring Nvidia under the Meta umbrella, the GPU might have become a proprietary tool for the Metaverse. Because this deal failed to materialize, Nvidia remained an open ecosystem, allowing researchers at Google and OpenAI to eventually use that same hardware for a little thing called a Transformer model. The second major “accident” in Nvidia’s journey was the Cryptocurrency boom. For years, Nvidia’s stock and production cycles were whipped around by the price of Ethereum. To the outside world, this looked like a distraction—a volatile market that Nvidia was chasing to satisfy shareholders. However, the crypto miners demanded exactly what AI would later require: massive, parallel processing power and specialized chips (ASICs and high-end GPUs) that could perform simple calculations millions of times per second. Nvidia leaned into this demand, refining their CUDA platform and their manufacturing scale. They weren’t building for LLMs yet; they were building for miners. But in doing so, they solved the scalability problem of parallel computing. When the “AI Winter” ended and the industry realized that Deep Learning was the path forward, Nvidia didn’t have to invent a new chip. They just had to rebrand the one they had already perfected for the blockchain. Preparation met opportunity, but the opportunity wasn’t the one they had initially invited to the dance. In 2021, Nvidia’s primary concern was “Lite Hash Rate” (LHR) cards to deter crypto miners so gamers could finally buy GPUs. This era of forced scaling forced Nvidia to master the art of data-center-grade reliability. When ChatGPT arrived, the transition was seamless. The “Accidental Innovation” here was that the mathematical operations required to verify a block on a chain are fundamentally similar to the vector mathematics required to predict the next word in a sentence. Nvidia had built the world’s best token-prediction machine while thinking they were building the world’s best ledger-validation machine. While Nvidia currently sits on the throne of Accidental Innovation, the next wave of change-makers is already emerging by attempting to turn that accident into a deliberate architecture. Cerebras Systems is building “wafer-scale” engines that dwarf traditional GPUs, aiming to eliminate the networking bottlenecks that Nvidia’s “accidental” legacy still carries. Groq (not to be confused with the AI model) is focusing on LPU (Language Processing Units) that prioritize the inference speed necessary for real-time human interaction. In the software layer, Modular is working to decouple the AI software stack from specific hardware, potentially neutralizing Nvidia’s CUDA moat. Finally, keep an eye on CoreWeave, which has pivoted from crypto mining to become a specialized “AI cloud,” proving that Nvidia’s accidental path is a blueprint others can follow by design. We must stop teaching innovation as a series of deliberate masterstrokes. When we do that, we discourage leaders from experimenting. If you believe you must see the entire future before you act, you will stay paralyzed. Nvidia’s success is a testament to Agile Resilience. They built a powerful, flexible tool, stayed independent during a crucial acquisition window, and were humble enough to let the market show them what their technology was actually good for. As we move into this next phase of the Future Present, the lesson is clear: don’t just build for the world you see today. Build for the accidents of tomorrow. Because in the end, the most impactful innovations are rarely the ones we planned; they are the ones we were ready for.

This year-in-review episode features an exceptional panel of Python luminaries representing diverse perspectives across education, industry, and core Python development: Gregory Kapfhammer is an Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science who conducts research in software engineering and software testing. He has built numerous Python tools, with current research focusing on flaky test cases in Python projects. Gregory also hosts the Software Engineering Radio podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, where he has interviewed many members of the Python community. Thomas Wouters is a longtime Python core developer who worked at Google for 17 years before joining Meta. He has served multiple terms on the PSF Board and the Python Steering Council. In 2025, Thomas received the PSF Distinguished Service Award recognizing his extensive contributions to Python. Jodie Burchell is a Data Scientist and Developer Advocate at JetBrains, working on PyCharm. She has been a data scientist for around 10 years after transitioning from a career as a clinical psychologist. Jodie has been working with NLP and LLMs since before they became mainstream, including early Google language models from 2019. Brett Cannon has been at Microsoft for 10 years and is currently working on AI R&D for Python developers. He also maintains WASI support for Python and does internal consulting. Despite being a core developer for 22 years, Brett jokes that he is the "shortest-running" core developer on this panel. He previously managed the Python experience in VS Code. Reuven Lerner is a freelance Python and Pandas trainer who celebrated 30 years of freelancing in 2024. He teaches Python and Pandas both at companies and through his online platform, writes newsletters, publishes books, and speaks at conferences. Barry Warsaw has been a Python core developer since 1994, making him the longest-tenured developer on the panel. He worked with Guido van Rossum at CNRI in Python's early days, handling mailing lists, version control, and websites. Barry created the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) process 25 years ago. He is currently at NVIDIA doing Python work split between internal projects and external open-source community contributions, and serves on the Steering Council. If you are newer to Python and want to get the most out of this episode analysis, here are some foundational concepts that will help: The most transformative development in Python for 2025 is the advancement of free-threaded Python, which removes the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Thomas Wouters, who championed this effort, confirmed that free threading has moved from experimental to officially supported status in Python 3.14. The performance overhead is remarkably small - basically the same speed on macOS (due to ARM hardware and Clang optimizations) and only a few percent slower on Linux with recent GCC versions. The main challenge now is community adoption: getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for the new APIs. Barry Warsaw called this "one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3." Early experiments show promising results, with highly parallel workloads seeing 10x or greater speedups. The PyTorch data loader, for example, has seen massive improvements by leveraging multiple threads. Jodie Burchell provided a grounded perspective on AI in 2025, noting that GPT-5's release in August marked a turning point where mainstream observers began questioning the AI bubble. The "scaling laws" that promised exponential improvements turned out not to be laws at all, and OpenAI's internal struggles to deliver on AGI promises became public. Investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the US, which Jodie called "a really scary prospect." Despite the bubble concerns, the panel universally agreed that LLMs are incredibly useful tools that are here to stay. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that automated refactoring, test generation, and code coverage improvement - goals he thought would never be achieved in his lifetime - are now routine with tools like Claude Code. The consensus: even if models never improve beyond current capabilities, they represent a massive leap beyond previous development tools. Barry Warsaw noted he no longer searches for documentation - he just asks the AI to set things up. Brett Cannon highlighted a fundamental shift in how Python developers work: tools like uv, Hatch, and PDM now treat Python itself as an implementation detail. Instead of the traditional workflow of installing Python, creating a virtual environment, and managing dependencies, developers can now simply run a command like uv run and everything is handled automatically. This represents a "renewed focus on user experience" according to Barry Warsaw. The distance between having an idea and having working code has dramatically narrowed. Combined with PEP 723 (inline script metadata), you can now put uv in the shebang line of a Python script and share it without any setup instructions - the script carries its own dependency information. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that he now starts undergraduate students with uv on the first day of class, eliminating the week-long setup struggles that used to plague even strong students. Gregory Kapfhammer declared 2025 "the year of type checking and language server protocols," highlighting the emergence of three new Rust-based type checkers: Pyrefly from Meta, ty from Astral, and Zubon from David Halter (creator of Jedi). These tools have transformed what previously took tens or hundreds of seconds into sub-second operations. The speed improvements fundamentally change how developers interact with type checking - it becomes a real-time feedback loop rather than a batch process. However, Gregory noted a challenge: different type checkers can disagree on whether code has errors, even on the same codebase. His research team built a tool that automatically generates Python programs causing type checkers to disagree with each other. The PyLands team at Microsoft is working with the Pyrefly team to define a Type Server Protocol (TSP) that would let type checkers feed information to higher-level LSPs. Reuven Lerner raised concerns about Python's funding sustainability. The PSF had to pause its grants program and turned down an NSF government grant due to attached DEI restrictions that conflicted with PSF values. Most Python users have no idea the language needs funding - they just know they can download it for free. Thomas Wouters pointed out that major AI companies, despite relying entirely on PyPI and Python infrastructure, have done "basically no sponsorship of the PSF." The amounts needed are surprisingly small - less than what a medium company spends on expensed meal tips annually, or less than a Silicon Valley developer's salary. All panelists' employers (Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, JetBrains) are PSF sponsors, but many companies using Python are not. Reuven noted that NumFocus has about twice the PSF's budget, suggesting it is possible to get corporate sponsorship for Python-related projects. Thomas Wouters mentioned lazy imports as his "second favorite child" topic - a PEP that was accepted in 2025 and will significantly improve Python startup time and import performance. This feature defers the actual importing of modules until they are first used, rather than loading everything at startup. The lazy imports PEP (810) had broad community support despite some very vocal opposition. Pablo Galindo, a Steering Council member, led the effort and bore the brunt of criticism despite the technical merits being clear. This feature will be especially impactful for applications with many imports that may not all be needed for every code path. Barry Warsaw, who created the PEP process 25 years ago, acknowledged that authoring PEPs has become "incredibly difficult and emotionally draining." The community has grown exponentially, but discussions on discuss.python.org can become toxic. PEP authors regularly receive vitriol in their personal inboxes for proposing technical changes. The Steering Council itself exists because Guido van Rossum received such abuse over PEP 572 (the walrus operator) that he stepped down as BDFL. Thomas shared that Pablo Galindo received "ridiculous accusations" in his mailbox simply for proposing lazy imports. Core developers sometimes skip the PEP process entirely to avoid this gauntlet, which is also problematic because important changes don't get properly documented or discussed. Barry believes Python needs to rethink how it evolves the language while not losing the voice of users. With free threading joining asyncio, multiprocessing, and subinterpreters, Python now has multiple concurrency approaches. Reuven asked how developers should choose between them. Thomas explained that most end users should not need to make these low-level choices - higher-level abstractions should handle it. Brett suggested using concurrent.futures as a unified interface where you start with threads (fastest), fall back to subinterpreters if needed, then to process pools. Michael Kennedy expressed hope that Python's concurrency could eventually solidify around async/await with decorators indicating the execution mode, hiding the complexity from developers. The key insight is that different problems benefit from different approaches, and libraries like PyTorch are already combining techniques (using threads for data loading within an async framework) to achieve massive speedups. Gregory Kapfhammer gave a shout-out to regional Python conferences, specifically highlighting PyOhio as a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee, hosted at universities like Ohio State and Cleveland State. These local events provide accessible entry points to the Python community. Reuven shared a contrasting experience attending a non-Python conference where all speakers were from advertisers and sponsors, and people were not interested in sharing. He called Python conferences "really special" for the combination of career benefits and genuine community connection. The community aspect remains one of Python's greatest strengths. A Stanford study (the "10K Developer Study") examining real codebases found nuanced results about AI coding assistants. Yes, there are productivity boosts, but AI produces more code that tends to be worse than human-written code and introduces more bugs. When accounting for refactoring and debugging time, developers are still more productive overall. AI works better for greenfield projects, smaller codebases, simpler problems, and more popular languages (more training data). Jodie emphasized that like an IDE, AI is a tool - not a replacement. Barry's favorite use is bypassing documentation: instead of searching docs, he asks the AI to set things up. Gregory noted that AI agents work much better when given fast feedback tools like type checkers and linters. Thomas emphasized the importance of new people joining Python - as triagers, drive-by commenters, or eventually core developers. Python is what the community makes it, with no company dictating direction. Barry encouraged anyone interested in becoming a core developer to find a mentor, and anyone wanting to be involved with the PSF to reach out. Thomas pointed out he is a high school dropout who never went to college, while Brett has a PhD - neither credential is required to contribute meaningfully to Python. The call to action: run for the Steering Council (they need more candidates), sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, and engage with the community in whatever way fits your skills and interests. "Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. The GIL's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight." -- Michael Kennedy "I can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be if I had a system that could automatically refactor and then add test cases and increase the code coverage and make sure all my checkers and linters pass... I remember thinking five to seven years ago I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. And now when I use Anthropic's models through Claude Code, it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly." -- Gregory Kapfhammer "I'm glad I'll never have to write bash from scratch ever again." -- Brett Cannon on AI assistance "I never even search for the docs. I never even try to read the docs anymore. I just say, hey, I need to set up this website. And I just tell me what to do or just do it. And it's an immense time saver." -- Barry Warsaw "The GIL never gave you thread safety. The GIL gave CPython's internals thread safety. It never really affected Python code." -- Thomas Wouters "Free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance." -- Barry Warsaw "It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they came in because every single one has such a big impact." -- Thomas Wouters on PSF funding "What the PSF would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every year." -- Thomas Wouters, quoting Ned Batchelder "I don't want to call on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also donating their time for Python. It's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves to this community even more." -- Jodie Burchell on funding burnout "Python is the community or the community is Python. There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. Python is what we make it." -- Barry Warsaw "I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. And look at me." -- Thomas Wouters on qualifications needed for Python contribution GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): A mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. Its removal in free-threaded Python enables true parallel execution of Python code across multiple CPU cores. Free-Threaded Python: A build of Python without the GIL, allowing multiple threads to execute Python bytecode simultaneously. Officially supported in Python 3.14. PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal): The formal process for proposing major changes to Python. Created by Barry Warsaw 25 years ago, PEPs document design decisions and the rationale behind language features. LSP (Language Server Protocol): A protocol for communication between code editors and language-specific tools that provide features like autocomplete, go-to-definition, and error checking. Type Checker: A tool that analyzes Python code with type hints to catch type-related errors before runtime. Examples include mypy, Pyrefly, ty, and Pyright. Lazy Imports: A feature (PEP 810) where module imports are deferred until the imported names are actually used, improving startup time for applications with many imports. PyPI (Python Package Index): The official repository for Python packages, run by the PSF and used by millions of developers daily. Steering Council: A five-person elected body that provides leadership for Python's development, created after Guido van Rossum stepped down as BDFL in 2018. PEP 723: Inline script metadata that allows Python scripts to declare their dependencies and Python version requirements directly in the file, enabling tools like uv to automatically set up the correct environment. Subinterpreters: Isolated Python interpreters running in separate threads within the same process, providing parallelism with stronger isolation than threads but less overhead than multiprocessing. For those looking to deepen their understanding of topics covered in this episode, here are relevant courses from Talk Python Training: Rock Solid Python with Python Typing: Learn the ins-and-outs of Python typing, explore frameworks using types like Pydantic and FastAPI, and get guidance for using types effectively in your applications. Async Techniques and Examples in Python: Master the entire spectrum of Python's parallel APIs including async/await, asyncio, threads, multiprocessing, and coordination techniques. LLM Building Blocks for Python: Learn to integrate large language models into Python applications with structured outputs, chat workflows, and production-ready async pipelines. Getting Started with pytest: Master pytest's five superpowers - simple test functions, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins. Python for Absolute Beginners: Start from the very beginning with CS 101 concepts before building increasingly complex Python applications. Modern Python Projects: Learn project structure, dependency management, testing, documentation, CI/CD, and deployment for real-world Python applications. Python in 2025 stands at an inflection point where decades of foundational work are paying off in transformative ways. The removal of the GIL promises to unlock true parallelism, modern tooling like uv is abstracting away complexity that once frustrated beginners, and Rust-based type checkers are making static analysis feel instantaneous. Yet beneath these technical victories lies a community wrestling with sustainability - funding challenges, contributor burnout, and the difficulty of evolving a language used by millions through a 25-year-old proposal process. What shines through this conversation is that Python's greatest asset has always been its people. From Barry Warsaw, who has been contributing since 1994 and created the very PEP process he now seeks to reform, to Jodie Burchell, a relative newcomer who marveled at how welcoming the community has been, the panel represents a continuum of experience united by shared values. The call to action is clear: sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, contribute in whatever way fits your skills, attend regional conferences, and remember that Python is not a product controlled by any corporation - it is what we collectively make it. The future is being built right now by people who simply showed up and got involved. 00:00 Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. 00:04 The guild's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, 00:07 and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight. 00:11 On this episode, we have an amazing panel to give us a range of perspectives 00:15 on what mattered in 2025 in Python. 00:19 We have Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Gregory Kampfhammer, Jody Burchell, Reuven Lerner, 00:24 and Thomas Worders on the show to give us their thoughts. 00:28 This is Talk Python To Me, episode 532, recorded December 9th, 2025. 00:50 Welcome to Talk Python To Me, the number one Python podcast for developers and data scientists. 00:55 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 00:57 I'm a PSF fellow who's been coding for over 25 years. 01:01 Let's connect on social media. 01:03 You'll find me and Talk Python on Mastodon, BlueSky, and X. 01:06 The social links are all in your show notes. 01:09 You can find over 10 years of past episodes at talkpython.fm. 01:12 And if you want to be part of the show, you can join our recording live streams. 01:16 That's right. 01:17 We live stream the raw uncut version of each episode on YouTube. 01:20 Just visit talkpython.fm/youtube to see the schedule of upcoming events. 01:25 Be sure to subscribe there and press the bell so you'll get notified anytime we're recording. 01:29 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:33 Sentry's SEER AI code review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:39 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:43 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:46 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:50 Hey, before we jump into the interview, I just want to send a little message to all the companies out there with products and services trying to reach developers. 01:59 That is the listeners of this show. 02:01 As we're rolling into 2026, I have a bunch of spots open. 02:05 So please reach out to me if you're looking to sponsor a podcast or just generally sponsor things in the community. 02:12 And you haven't necessarily considered podcasts. 02:14 You really should reach out to me and I'll help you connect with the Talk Python audience. 02:20 thanks everyone for listening all of 2025 and here we go into 2026 cheers hey everyone it's so 02:27 awesome to be here with you all thanks for taking the time out of your day to be part of talk python 02:31 for this year in review this python year in review so yeah let's just jump right into it gregory 02:38 welcome welcome to the show welcome back to the show how you doing hi i'm an associate professor 02:42 of computer and information science and i do research and software engineering and software 02:46 testing. I've built a bunch of Python tools, and one of the areas we're studying now is flaky test 02:51 cases in Python projects. I'm also really excited about teaching in a wide variety of areas. In fact, 02:57 I use Python for operating systems classes or theory of computation classes. And one of the 03:02 things I'm excited about is being a podcast host. I'm also a host on the Software Engineering Radio 03:08 podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, and I've had the cool opportunity to interview a 03:14 whole bunch of people in the Python community. So Michael, thanks for welcoming me to the show. 03:18 Yeah, it's awesome to have you back. And we talked about FlakyTest last time. I do have to say 03:23 your AV setup is quite good. I love the new mic and all that. Thomas, welcome. Awesome to have 03:29 you here. Thanks for having me. I'm Thomas Wauters. I'm a longtime Python core developer, 03:34 although not as long as one of the other guests on this podcast. I worked at Google for 17 years. 03:40 for the last year or so I've worked at Meta. In both cases, I work on Python itself within the 03:45 company and just deploying it internally. I've also been a board member of the PSF, although I'm not 03:51 one right now. And I've been a steering council member for five years and currently not because 03:58 the elections are going and I don't know what the result is going to be. But I think there's like 04:02 five, six chance that I'll be on the steering council since we only have six candidates for 04:09 five positions when this episode probably airs. I don't know. That's quite the contribution to the 04:14 whole community. Thank you. I always forget this. I also got the, what is it, the Distinguished 04:19 Service Award from the PSF this year. I should probably mention that. So yes, I have been 04:24 recognized. No need to talk about it further. Wonderful. Wonderful. Jody, welcome back on the 04:29 show. Awesome to catch up with you. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I am a data scientist and 04:34 developer advocate at JetBrains working on PyCharm. And I've been a data scientist for around 10 04:39 years. And prior to that, I was actually a clinical psychologist. So that was my training, 04:45 my PhD, but abandoned academia for greener pastures. Let's put it that way. 04:50 Noah Franz-Gurig. 04:53 Brett, hello. Good to see you. 04:55 Hello. Yes. Yeah, let's see here. I've been at Microsoft for 10 years. I started doing, 05:00 working on AI R&D for Python developers. 05:03 Also keep Wazzy running for Python here and do a lot of internal consulting for teams outside. 05:09 I am actually the shortest running core developer on this call, amazingly, 05:14 even though I've been doing it for 22 years. 05:16 I've also only gotten the Frank Wilson award, not the DSA. 05:19 So I feel very under accomplished here as a core developer. 05:22 Yeah, that's me in a nutshell. 05:24 Otherwise, I'm still trying to catch that. 05:26 Most quoted. 05:27 Yeah, most quoted. 05:29 I will say actually at work, it is in my email footer that I'm a famous Python quotationist. 05:33 That was Anthony Shaw's suggestion, by the way. 05:35 That was not mine, but does link to the April Fool's joke from last year. 05:39 And I am still trying to catch Anthony Shaw, I think, on appearances on this podcast. 05:43 Well, plus one. 05:44 Anthony Shaw should be here, honestly. 05:46 I mean, I put it out into Discord. 05:48 He could have been here, but probably at an odd time. 05:51 You used to work on VS Code a bunch on the Python aspect of VS Code. 05:54 You recently changed roles, right? 05:57 Not recently. 05:57 That was, I used to be the dev manager. 05:59 Every seven years, years ago. 06:01 Yeah, September of 2024. 06:03 So it's been over a year. 06:04 But yeah, I used to be the dev manager. 06:04 That counts as recent for me. 06:06 Yes, I used to be the dev manager for the Python experience in VS Code. 06:09 Okay, very cool. 06:10 That's quite a shift. 06:11 Yeah, it went back to being an IC basically. 06:13 You got all, you're good at your TPS reports again now? 06:17 Actually, I just did do my connect, so I kind of did. 06:19 Awesome. 06:20 Reuven, I bet you haven't filed a TPS report in at least a year. 06:23 So yeah, I'm Reuven. 06:24 I'm a freelance Python and Pandas trainer. 06:28 I just celebrated this past week 30 years since going freelance. 06:32 So I guess it's working out okay. 06:35 We'll know at some point if I need to get a real job. 06:38 I teach Python Pandas both at companies and on my online platform. 06:41 I have newsletters. 06:42 I've written books, speaking conferences, and generally try to help people improve their 06:47 Python and Pandas fluency and confidence and have a lot of fun with this community as well 06:51 as with the language. 06:52 Oh, good to have you here. 06:53 Barry, it's great to have a musician on the show. 06:56 Thanks. 06:58 Yeah, I've got my bases over here. 07:00 So, you know, if you need to be serenaded. 07:02 Yeah, like a Zen of Python may break out at any moment. 07:05 You never know when it's going to happen. 07:07 Thanks for having me here. 07:08 Yeah, I've been a core developer for a long time, since 1994. 07:13 And I've been, you know, in the early days, I did tons of stuff for Python.org. 07:20 I worked with Guido at CNRI and we moved everything from the mailing, the Postmaster stuff, 07:27 and the version control systems back in the day, websites, all that kind of stuff. 07:32 I try to not do any of those things anymore. 07:35 There's way more competent people doing that stuff now. 07:39 I have been a release manager. 07:42 I'm currently back on the steering council and running again. 07:47 between Thomas and I, we'll see who makes it to six years, I guess. 07:52 And I'm currently working for NVIDIA, and I do all Python stuff. 07:58 Some half and half, roughly, of internal things and external open source community work, 08:05 both in packaging and in core Python. 08:08 That's, I guess, I think that's about it. 08:10 Yeah, you all are living in exciting tech spaces, that's for sure. 08:14 That's for sure. 08:15 For sure. 08:16 Yeah. Well, great to have you all back on the show. Let's start with our first topic. So the 08:20 idea is we've each picked at least a thing that we think stood out in 2025 in the Python space 08:27 that we can focus on. And let's go with Jody first. I'm excited to hear what you thought was 08:33 one of the bigger things. I'm going to mention AI. Like, wow, what a big surprise. So to kind of 08:40 give context of where I'm coming from, I've been working in NLP for a long time. I like to say I was 08:45 working on LLMs before they were cool. So sort of playing around with the very first releases from 08:50 Google in like 2019, incorporating that into search. So I've been very interested sort of 08:56 seeing the unfolding of the GPT models as they've grown. And let's say slightly disgusted by the 09:03 discourse around the models as they become more mainstream, more sort of the talk about people's 09:09 jobs being replaced, a lot of the hysteria, a lot of the doomsday stuff. So I've been doing talks 09:15 and other content for around two and a half years now, just trying to cut through the hype a bit, 09:19 being like, you know, they're just language models, they're good for language tasks. Let's think about 09:23 realistically what they're about. And what was very interesting for me this year, I've been 09:29 incorrectly predicting the bubble bursting for about two and a half years. So I was quite vindicated 09:34 when in August, GPT-5 came out, and all of a sudden, everyone else started saying, 09:40 maybe this is a bubble. 09:41 Don't you think that was the first big release that was kind of a letdown compared to what the hype was? 09:47 Yeah, and it was really interesting. 09:48 So I found this really nice Atlantic article, and I didn't save it, unfortunately, 09:52 but essentially it told sort of the whole story of what was going on behind the scenes. 09:58 So GPT-4 came out in March of 2023, and that was the model that came out 10:03 with this Microsoft research paper saying, you know, sparks of AGI, artificial general intelligence, 10:08 blah, blah, blah. And from that point, there was really this big expectation sort of fueled by 10:15 OpenAI that GPT-5 was going to be the AGI model. And it turns out what was happening internally 10:22 is these scaling laws that were sort of considered, you know, this exponential growth thing that would 10:27 sort of push the power of these models perhaps towards human-like performance. They weren't 10:33 laws at all. And of course they started failing. So the model that they had originally pitched as 10:38 GPT-4 just didn't live up to performance. They started this post-training stuff where they were 10:43 going more into like specialized reasoning models. And what we have now are good models that are good 10:48 for specific tasks, but I don't know what happened, but eventually they had to put the GPT-5 label on 10:54 something. And yeah, let's say it didn't live up to expectations. So I think the cracks are starting 11:01 to show because the underlying expectation always was this will be improving to the point where 11:08 anything's possible and you can't put a price on that. But it turns out that if maybe there's a 11:14 limit on what's possible, yeah, you can put a price on it. And a lot of the valuations are on the 11:19 first part. Yes. And it's always been a bit interesting to me because I come from a scientific 11:24 background and you need to know how to measure stuff, right? And I'm like, what are you trying 11:28 to achieve? Like Gregory's nodding, like, please jump in. I'm on my monologue, so please don't 11:34 interrupt me. You really need to understand what you're actually trying to get these models to do. 11:38 What is AGI? No one knows this. And what's going to be possible with this? And it's more science 11:46 fiction than fact. So this for me has been the big news this year, and I'm feeling slightly smug, 11:51 I'm going to be honest, even though my predictions were off by about a year and a half. 11:55 Yeah, maybe it's not an exponential curve. 11:56 It's a titration S curve with an asymptote. 11:59 We'll see. 12:00 Yeah, sigmoid. 12:01 Yeah. 12:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 12:03 I mean, I think we have to sort of separate the technology from the business. 12:07 And the technology, even if it doesn't get any better, even if we stay with what we have today, 12:13 I still think this is like one of the most amazing technologies I've ever seen. 12:18 It's not a god. 12:19 It's not a panacea. 12:21 But it's like a chainsaw that if you know how to use it, it's really effective. 12:25 but in the hands of amateurs, you can really get hurt. And so, yes, it's great to see this sort of 12:32 thing happening and improving, but who knows where it's going to go. And I'm a little skeptical of 12:36 the AGI thing. What I'm a little more worried about is that these companies seem to have no 12:40 possible way of ever making the money that they're promising to their investors. And I do worry a lot 12:47 that we're sort of like a year 2000 situation where, yeah, the technology is fantastic, 12:53 But the businesses are unsustainable. And out of the ashes of what will happen, we will get some amazing technology and even better than we had before. But there are going to be ashes. 13:03 For me, that also makes me worry. And I don't know if anyone reads Ed Zitron here. He's a 13:09 journalist kind of digging into the state of the AI industry. He does get a bit sort of, 13:15 his reputation is a bit of a crank now. So I think he's leaned into that pretty hard, 13:20 but he does take the time to also pull out numbers and point out things that don't make sense. 13:25 And he was one of the first ones to sound the whistle on this circular funding we've been seeing. 13:30 So the worry, of course, is when a lot of this becomes borrowings from banks and then that starts dragging in funding from everyday people. 13:41 And also the effect that this has had on particularly the U.S. economy, like the stock market. 13:45 I think the investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the U.S., which is a really scary prospect. 13:54 That is crazy. 13:55 Mm-hmm. But yeah, also as Reven said, I love LLMs. They are the most powerful tools we've 14:02 ever had for natural language processing. It's phenomenal the problems we can solve with them 14:06 now. I didn't think this sort of stuff would be possible when I started in data science. 14:10 I still think there's a use case for agents, although I do think they've been a bit overstated, 14:16 especially now that I'm building them. Let's say it's not very fun building 14:20 non-deterministic software. It's quite frustrating, actually. But I hope we're going to see improvements 14:25 in the framework, particularly I've heard good things about Pydantic AI. And yeah, hopefully we 14:30 can control the input outputs and make them a bit more strict. This will fix a lot of the problems. 14:36 One thing I do want to put out in this conversation, I think is worth separating. And Reuven, 14:41 you touched on this some. I want to suggest to you, I'll throw this out to you all and see what 14:45 you think. I think it's very possible that this AI bubble crashes the economy and causes bad things 14:51 economically to happen and a bunch of companies that are like wrappers over open ai api go away 14:58 but i don't think things like the agentic coding tools will vanish they might stop training they 15:03 might slow their advance because that's super expensive but i even as if you said even if we 15:09 just had claude sonnet 4 and the world never got something else it would be so much far farther 15:16 beyond autocomplete and the other stuff that we had before and stack overflow that it's i don't 15:20 think it's going to go. The reason I'm throwing this out there is I was talking to somebody and 15:23 they were like, well, I don't think it's worth learning because I think the bubble is going to 15:26 pop. And so I don't want to learn this agent at coding because it won't be around very long. 15:30 What do you all think? It's here to stay. I think it's just, where's the limit? Where does it stop? 15:34 I think that's the big open question for everybody, right? Like pragmatically, it's a tool. It's useful 15:40 in some scenarios and not in others. And you just have to learn how to use the tool appropriately 15:44 for your use case and to get what you need out of it. And sometimes that's not using it because 15:47 it's just going to take up more time than it will to be productive. But other times it's 15:51 fully juices up your productivity and you can get more done. It's give and take. But I don't think 15:56 it's going to go anywhere because as you said, Michael, there's even academics doing research now. 16:00 There's open weight models as well. There's a lot of different ways to run this, whether you're 16:05 at the scale of the frontier models that are doing these huge trainings or you're doing something 16:11 local and more specialized. So I think the general use of AI isn't going anywhere. I think it's just 16:16 the question of how far can this current trend go and where will it be i want to say stop that's 16:22 because that plays into the whole it's never it's going to completely go away i don't think it ever 16:25 will i think it's just going to be where where are we going to start to potentially bump up against 16:29 limits one thing that i'll say is that many of these systems are almost to me like a dream come 16:33 true now admittedly it's the case that the systems i'm building are maybe only tens of thousands of 16:38 lines or hundreds of thousands of lines but i can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be 16:44 if I had a system that could automatically refactor 16:47 and then add test cases and increase the code coverage 16:51 and make sure all my checkers and linters pass and do that automatically and continue the process 16:57 until it achieved its goal. 16:59 And I remember thinking that five to seven years ago, 17:01 I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. 17:05 And now when I use like anthropics models through open code or Claude code, 17:10 it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly, 17:13 even for systems that are of medium to moderate scale. 17:17 So from my vantage point, it is a really exciting tool. 17:20 It's incredibly powerful. 17:21 And what I have found is that the LLMs are much better 17:24 when I teach them how to use tools and the tools that it's using 17:29 are actually really quick, fast ones that can give rapid feedback to the LLM 17:34 and tell it whether it's moving in the right direction or not. 17:36 Yeah, there's an engineering angle to this. 17:39 It's not just Vibe Coding if you take the time to learn it. 17:42 There was actually a very interesting study. I don't think the study itself has been released. 17:48 I haven't found it yet, but I saw a talk on it by some guys at Stanford. So they call it the 10K 17:53 developer study. And basically what they were doing was studying real code bases, including, 17:59 I think 80% of them were actually private code bases and seeing the point where the team started 18:05 adopting AI. And so their findings are really interesting and nuanced. And I think they probably 18:10 intuitively align with what a lot of us have experienced with AI. So basically, yes, there 18:16 are productivity boosts, but it produces a lot of code, but the code tends to be worse than the code 18:21 you would write and also introduces more bugs. So when you account for the time that you spend 18:27 refactoring and debugging, you're still more productive. But then it also depends on the 18:32 type of project, as Gregory was saying. So it's better for greenfield projects, it's better for 18:36 smaller code bases. It's better for simpler problems and it's better for more popular languages because 18:41 obviously there's more training data. And so this was actually, I like this study so much. I'll 18:46 actually share it with you, Michael, if you want to put it in the show notes, but it shows that, 18:50 yeah, the picture is not that simple and all this conflicting information and conflicting experiences 18:54 people were having line up completely with this. So again, like I work at an IDE company, it's tools 19:00 for the job. It's not like your IDE will replace you. AI is not going to replace you. It's just 19:06 going to make you maybe more productive sometimes. 19:08 Yeah. 19:09 Wait, IDE, you work for me. 19:11 Right. 19:12 It's not about you. 19:13 But then I work for the IDE. 19:18 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry. 19:22 Let me ask you a question. 19:24 What if you could see into the future? 19:26 We're talking about Sentry, of course. 19:28 So that means seeing potential errors, crashes, and bugs before they happen, before you even 19:33 accept them into your code base. 19:35 That's what Sentry's AI Sears Code Review offers. 19:39 You get error prediction based on real production history. 19:43 AI Sear Code Review flags the most impactful errors your PR is likely to introduce before merge 19:50 using your app's error and performance context, not just generic LLM pattern matching. 19:55 Sear will then jump in on new PRs with feedback and warning if it finds any potential issues. 20:01 Here's a real example. 20:03 On a new PR related to a search feature in a web app, we see a comment from seer bicenturybot in the PR. 20:11 And it says, potential bug, the process search results function, can enter an infinite recursion when a search query finds no matches. 20:19 As the recursive call lacks a return statement and a proper termination condition. 20:24 And Seer AI Code Review also provides additional details which you can expand for further information on the issue and suggested fixes. 20:32 And bam, just like that, Seer AI Code Review has stopped a bug in its tracks without any 20:37 devs in the loop. 20:38 A nasty infinite loop bug never made it into production. 20:42 Here's how you set it up. 20:43 You enable the GitHub Sentry integration on your Sentry account, enable Seer AI on your 20:49 Sentry account, and on GitHub, you install the Seer by Sentry app and connect it to your 20:53 repositories that you want it to validate. 20:55 So jump over to Sentry and set up Code Review for yourself. 20:59 Just visit talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 21:03 The link is in your podcast player show notes and on the episode page. 21:06 Thank you to Sentry for supporting Talk Python and me. 21:10 I mean, the other thing is a lot of people and a lot of the sort of when people talk about AI 21:15 and LLMs and so forth in context of coding, it's the LLM writing code for us. 21:20 And maybe because I'm not doing a lot of serious coding, 21:23 it's more instruction and so forth. 21:25 I use it as like a sparring or brainstorming partner So it does, you know, checking of my newsletters for language and for tech edits and just sort of exploring ideas. 21:37 And for that, maybe it's because I do everything in the last minute and I don't have other people around or I'm lazy or cheap and don't want to pay them. 21:43 But definitely the quality of my work has improved dramatically. 21:46 The quality of my understanding has improved, even if it never wrote a line of code for me. 21:50 Just getting that feedback on a regular automatic basis is really helpful. 21:54 Yeah, I totally agree with you. 21:55 All right. We don't want to spend too much time on this topic, even though I believe Jody has put her finger on what might be the biggest tidal wave of 2025. 22:06 But still, a quick parting thoughts. Anyone else? 22:08 I'm glad I'll never have the right bash from scratch ever again. 22:12 Tell me about it. 22:13 Yeah. 22:15 I'll just say from anecdotally, the thing that I love about it is when I need to do something 22:22 and I need to go through docs, online docs for whatever it is, you know, it might be 22:28 GitLab or some library that I want to use or something like that. 22:32 I never even search for the docs. 22:33 I never even try to read the docs anymore. 22:35 I just say, hey, you know, whatever model I need to set up this website. 22:41 And I just, just tell me what to do or just do it. 22:43 And it's an immense time saver and productivity. 22:47 And then it gets me bootstrapped to the place where now I can start to be creative. 22:52 I don't have to worry about just like digging through pages and pages and pages of docs to 22:57 figure out one little setting here or there. 23:00 That's an amazing time saver. 23:02 Yeah, that's a really good point. 23:03 Another thing that I have noticed, there might be many things for which I had a really good 23:07 mental model, but my brain can only store so much information. 23:10 So for example, I know lots about the abstract syntax tree for Python, but I forget that 23:16 sometimes. 23:16 And so it's really nice for me to be able to bring that back into my mind quickly with 23:21 an LLM. 23:22 And if it's generating code for me that's doing a type of AST parsing, I can tell whether 23:27 that's good code or not because I can refresh that mental model. 23:30 So in those situations, it's not only the docs, but it's something that I used to know 23:35 really well that I have forgotten some of. 23:37 And the LLM often is very powerful when it comes to refreshing my memory and helping me to get started and move more quickly. 23:44 All right. Out of time, I think. Let's move on to Brett. What do you got, Brett? 23:48 Well, I actually originally said we should talk about AI, but Jody had a way better pitch for it than I did because my internal pitch was a little bit AI. 23:56 Do I actually have to write a paragraph explaining why? Then Jody actually did write the paragraph. So she did a much better job than I did. 24:01 So the other topic I had was using tools to run your Python code. 24:06 And what I mean by that is traditionally, if you think about it, 24:10 you install the Python interpreter, right? 24:13 Hopefully you create a virtual environment, install your dependencies, 24:16 and you call the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to run your code. 24:19 Those are all the steps you went through to run stuff. 24:21 But now we've got tools that will compress all that into a run command, 24:25 just do it all for you. 24:26 And it seems like the community has shown a level of comfort with that, 24:31 that I'd say snuck up on me a little bit, but I would say that I think it's a good thing, right? 24:37 It's showing us, I'm going to say us, as the junior core developer here on this call, 24:43 as to, sorry to make you too feel old, but admittedly, Barry did write my letter of recommendation 24:48 to my master's program. 24:51 So what happened was like, yeah, we had Hatch and PDM, 24:55 poetry before that, and uv as of last year, all kind of come through 24:59 and all kind of build on each other and take ideas from each other 25:02 and kind of just slowly build up this kind of repertoire of tool approaches 25:06 that they all kind of have a baseline kind of, not synergy is the right word, 25:09 but share just kind of approach to certain things with their own twists and added takes on things. 25:15 But in general, this whole like, you know what, you can just tell us to run this code 25:19 and we will just run it, right? 25:20 Like inline script metadata coming in and help making that more of a thing. 25:24 Disclaimer, I was the PEP delegate for getting that in. 25:27 But I just think that's been a really awesome trend And I'm hoping we can kind of leverage that a bit. 25:34 Like I have personal plans that we don't need to go into here, 25:36 but like I'm hoping as a Python core team, we can kind of like help boost this stuff up a bit 25:41 and kind of help keep a good baseline for this for everyone. 25:43 Because I think it's shown that Python is still really good for beginners. 25:45 You just have to give them the tools to kind of hide some of the details 25:49 to not shoot yourself in the foot and still leads to a great outcome. 25:52 Yeah, 2025 might be the year that the Python tools stepped outside of Python. 25:56 Instead of being, you install Python and then use the tools. 26:00 You do the tool to get Python, right? 26:02 Like uv and PDM and others. 26:03 Yeah, and inverted the dependency graph in terms of just how you put yourself in, right? 26:08 I think the interesting thing is these tools treat Python as an implementation detail almost, right? 26:13 Like when you just say uv or hatch run or PDM run thing, 26:17 these tools don't make you have to think about the interpreter. 26:19 It's just a thing that they pull in to make your code run, right? 26:22 It's not even necessarily something you have to care about if you choose not to. 26:26 And it's an interesting shift in that perspective, at least for me. 26:30 But I've also been doing this for a long time. 26:31 I think you're really onto something. 26:33 And what I love at sort of a high level is this, I think there's a renewed focus on the user experience. 26:40 And like uv plus the PEP 723, the inline metadata, you know, you can put uv in the shebang line of your script. 26:49 And now you don't have to think about anything. 26:52 You get uv from somewhere, and then it takes care of everything. 26:57 And Hatch can work the same way, I think, for developers. 27:01 But this renewed focus on installing your Python executable, 27:08 you don't really have to think about, because those things are very complicated, 27:12 and people just want to hit the ground running. 27:14 And so if you think about the previous discussion about AI, 27:18 I just want things to work. 27:20 I know what I want to do. 27:22 I can see it. 27:23 I can see the vision of it. 27:24 And I just don't want to. 27:25 An analogy is like when I first learned Python and I came from C++ and all those languages. 27:32 And I thought, oh my gosh, just to get like, hello world, 27:35 I have to do a million little things that I shouldn't have to do. 27:39 Like create a main and get my braces right and get all my variables right and get my pound includes correct. 27:46 And now I don't have to think about any of that stuff. 27:49 And the thing that was eye-opening for me with Python was the distance between vision of what I wanted and working code just really narrowed. 28:00 And I think that as we are starting to think about tools and environments and how to bootstrap all this stuff, we're also now taking all that stuff away. 28:09 Because people honestly don't care. 28:11 I don't care about any of that stuff. 28:13 I just want to go from like, I woke up this morning and had a cool idea and I just wanted to get at work. 28:18 Or you wanted to share it so you could just share the script and you don't have to say, 28:22 here's your steps that you get started with. 28:24 Exactly. 28:25 Exactly. 28:26 I want to thank the two of you for, oh, sorry, sorry, go ahead. 28:28 I'm just going to say, like, for years teaching Python that how do we get it installed? 28:34 At first, it surprised me how difficult it was for people. 28:37 Because like, oh, come on, we just got Python. 28:39 Like, what's so hard about this? 28:40 But it turns out it's a really big barrier to entry for newcomers. 28:45 And I'm very happy that Jupyter Lite now has solved its problems with input. 28:49 And it's like huge. 28:50 But until now, I hadn't really thought about starting with uv because it's cross-platform. 28:57 And if I say to people in the first 10 minutes of class, install uv for your platform and 29:02 then say uv in it, your project, bam, you're done. 29:05 It just works. 29:06 And then it works cross-platform. 29:07 This is mind-blowing. 29:08 And I'm going to try this at some point. 29:10 Thank you. 29:10 I can comment on the mind-blowing part because now when I teach undergraduate students, we 29:14 start with uv in the very first class. And it is awesome. There were things that would take students, 29:20 even very strong students who've had lots of experience, it would still take them a week to 29:26 set everything up on their new laptop and get everything ready and to understand all the key 29:30 concepts and know where something is in their path. And now we just say, install uv for your 29:36 operating system and get running on your computer. And then, hey, you're ready to go. And I don't have 29:42 teach them about docker containers and i don't have to tell them how to install python with some 29:47 package manager all of those things just work and i think from a learning perspective whether you're 29:52 in a class or whether you're in a company or whether you're teaching yourself uv is absolutely 29:58 awesome i'm actually wondering whether i am the one who is newest to python here i taught myself 30:05 python in 2011 so i was like python 2.7 stage but it was my first programming language i was just 30:12 procrastinating during my PhD. And I was like, I should learn to program. So I just taught myself 30:18 Python. And I can tell you, you do not come from an engineering background. And you're like, 30:23 what is Python? What is Python doing? Why am I typing Python to execute this hello world? And 30:29 if you're kind of curious, you get down a rabbit hole before you even get to the point where you're 30:33 just focusing on learning the basics. And so it's exactly, I was going to say with Reuven, 30:39 And like whether you thought about it for teaching, because we're now debating for Humble Data, 30:43 which is a beginner's data science community that I'm part of, whether we switch to uv. 30:48 This was Chuck's idea because it does abstract away all these details. 30:52 The debate I have is, is it too magic? 30:55 This is kind of the problem because I also remember learning about things like virtual 30:59 environments, because again, this was my first programming language and being like, 31:02 oh, it's a very good idea. 31:04 This is best practices. 31:05 And it's also a debate we have in PyCharm, right? 31:08 Like how much do you magic away the fundamentals versus making people think a little bit, but 31:15 I'm not sure. 31:15 All right. 31:15 Like, would you even let somebody run without a virtual environment? 31:19 That's like, that's a take you, that's a stance you could take. 31:21 I used to when I first learned Python, because it was too complicated, but then I learned 31:27 better. 31:28 But yes. 31:29 The consideration here is like hiding the magic isn't like hiding the details and having 31:34 all this magic just work is great as long as it works. 31:38 And the question is, how is it going to break down and how are people going to know how to deal 31:43 when it breaks down, if you hide all the magic? And I think virtual envs were, or let's say before 31:49 we had virtual envs, installing packages was very much in the, you had to know all the details 31:54 because it was very likely going to break down in some way right before we had virtual envs, 32:00 because you would end up with weird conflicts or multiple copies of a package installed in 32:04 different parts of the system. When we got virtual ends, we sort of didn't have to worry about that 32:10 anymore because we were trained in that you can just blow away the virtual one and it just works. 32:14 And with uv, we're back into, this looks like a single installation. We don't know what's going 32:19 to go on, but we've learned, we as a community and also the people working on uv, we have learned 32:25 from those earlier mistakes or not, maybe not mistakes, but consequences of the design. 32:32 And they have created something that is, that appears to be very stable where it's unlikely 32:38 the magic will break. 32:39 And when the magic does break, it's obvious what the problem is or, or it automatically 32:44 fixes itself. 32:45 So like it's not reusing, broken, installations and that kind of thing. 32:50 So the risk now, as it turns out, I think as is proven by the community adopting uv so 32:57 fast and so willingly, I think it's acceptable. 33:00 Well, I think it's, yeah, I think it's proven itself. 33:02 It's clear that this is, it's worth the potential of discovering weird edge cases later, both 33:09 because it's probably low likelihood, but also the people behind uv Astral have proven that 33:16 they would jump in and fix those issues, right? 33:18 They would do anything they need to keep uv workable the same way. 33:23 And they have a focus that Python as a whole cannot have because they cater to fewer use 33:28 cases than Python as a whole needs to. 33:31 On the audience, Galano says, as an enterprise tech director in Python coder, I believe we 33:36 should hide the magic which empowers the regular employee to do simple things that make their 33:40 job easier. 33:41 Yeah. 33:41 This notion of abstractions, right, has always been there in computer science. 33:47 And, you know, we've used tools or languages or systems where we've tried to bring that 33:53 abstraction layer up so that we don't have to think about all these details, as I mentioned 33:58 before. The question is, that's always the happy path. And when I'm trying to teach somebody 34:04 something like, here's how to use this library or here's how to use this tool, I try to be very 34:09 opinionated to keep people on that happy path. Like, assume everything's going to work just right. 34:15 Here's how you just make you go down that path to get the thing done that you want. The question 34:19 really is when things go wrong, how narrow is that abstraction? And are you able, and even when 34:27 you're just curious, like what's really going on underneath the hood? Of course, that's not a really 34:31 good analogy today because cars are basically computers on wheels that you can't really 34:36 understand how they work. But back in your day. But back in my day, we were changing spark plugs, 34:42 you know, but and crank that window down. Exactly. So I think we always have to leave that 34:50 room for the curious and the bad path where when things go wrong or when you're just like, 34:56 you know what, I understand how this works, but I'm kind of curious about what's really going on. 35:01 How easy is it for me to dive in and get a little bit more of that background, you know, 35:07 a little bit more of that understanding of what's going on. I want the magic to decompose, 35:12 right like you should be able to explain the magic path via a more decomposed steps using the tool 35:17 all the way down to what the tools like to do behind the scenes just just to admit i the reason 35:21 i brought this up and i've been thinking about this a lot is i'm thinking of trying to get the python 35:26 launcher to do a bit more because one interesting thing we haven't really brought up here is we're 35:31 all seeing uv uv uv uv is a company there's always there's they might disappear and we haven't 35:36 de-risked ourselves from that. Now we do have Hatch, we do have PDM, but as I said, there's kind 35:41 of a baseline I think they all share that I think they would be probably okay if the Python launcher 35:45 just did because that's based on standards, right? Because that's the other thing that there's been 35:48 a lot of work that has led to this step, right? Like we've gotten way more packaging standards, 35:52 we've got PEP 723, like we mentioned. There's a lot of work that's come up to lead to this point 35:58 that all these tools can lean on to have them all have an equivalent outcome because it's expected 36:03 is how they should be. 36:05 And so I think it's something we need to consider of how do we make sure, 36:09 like, by the way, uv, I know the people, they're great. 36:12 I'm not trying to spares them or think they're going to go away, 36:14 but it is something we have to consider. 36:16 And I will also say, Jody, I do think about this for teaching 36:20 because I'm a dad now and I don't want my kid coming home 36:24 when they get old enough to learn Python and go, hey, dad, 36:26 why is getting Python code running so hard? 36:29 So I want to make sure that that never happens. 36:32 But they fall in love with it from the start. 36:34 I realized something for the 2026 year interview. 36:37 I have to bring a sign that says time for next topic because we got a bunch of topics and we're running low on time. 36:43 So, Thomas, let's jump over to yours. 36:46 Oh, and I had two topics as well. 36:48 So I'm only going to have to pick my favorite child, right? 36:52 That's terrible. 36:53 My second favorite child is Lazy Imports, which is a relatively new development. 36:58 So we'll probably not get to that. 37:00 And just accepted. 37:00 Yes, it's been accepted and it's going to be awesome. 37:03 So I'll just give that a shout out and then move to my favorite child, which is free threaded 37:06 Python. 37:07 For those who were not aware, the global interpreter lock is going away. 37:12 I am stating it as a fact. 37:13 It's not actually a fact yet, but it, you know, that's because the steering council hasn't 37:18 realized the fact yet. 37:20 It is trending towards. 37:22 Well, I was originally on the steering council that accepted the proposal to add free threading 37:28 as a, as an experimental feature, we had this idea of adding it as experimental and then making it 37:34 supported, but not the default and then making it the default. And it was all a little vague and, 37:39 and up in the air. And then I didn't get reelected for the steering council last year, 37:44 which I was not sad about at all. I sort of ran on a, well, if there's nobody better, I'll do it, 37:49 but otherwise I have other things to do. And it turns out those other things were making sure that 37:54 prefer that Python landed in a supported state. So I lobbied the steering council quite hard, 38:00 as Barry might remember at the start of the year, to get some movement on this, like get some 38:04 decision going. So for Python 3.14, it is officially supported. The performance is great. It's like 38:10 between a couple of percent slower and 10% slower, depending on the hardware and the compiler that 38:16 you use. It's basically the same speed on macOS, which is really like it's, that's a combination of 38:23 the ARM hardware and Clang specializing things, but it's basically the same speed, which, wow. 38:29 And then on recent GCCs on Linux, it's like a couple of percent slower. The main problem is 38:35 really community adoption, getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for 38:40 the new APIs and the things that by necessity sort of broke, and also supporting free threading in a 38:48 in a good way and in packages for Python code, it turns out there's very few changes that 38:54 need to be made for things to work well under free threading. 38:57 They might not be entirely thread safe, but usually like almost always in cases where it 39:02 wasn't thread saved before either, because the guild doesn't actually affect thread safety. 39:07 Just the likelihood of things breaking. 39:09 I do think there's been a bit of a, the mindset of the Python community hasn't really been 39:14 focused on creating thread safe code because the GIL is supposed to protect us. 39:18 But soon as it takes multiple steps, then all of a sudden it's just less likely. 39:22 It's not that it couldn't happen. 39:23 Yeah, that's my point, right? 39:24 It's not the GIL never gave you threat safety. 39:27 The GIL gave cpythons internals threat safety. 39:31 It never really affected Python code and it very rarely affected thread safety in 39:36 extension modules as well. 39:37 So they already had to take care of, of making sure that the global interpreter 39:41 couldn't be released by something that they ended up calling indirectly so it's actually not that 39:46 hard to port most things to support free threading and the benefits we've seen some experimental 39:53 work because you know it's still it's still new there's still a lot of things that don't 39:56 quite support it there's still places where thread contention slows things things down a lot but 40:02 we've seen a lot of examples of really promising very parallel problems that now speed up by 10x or 40:09 more. And it's going to be really excited in the future. And it's in 2025 that this all started. 40:15 I mean, Sam started it earlier, but he's been working on this for years, but it landed in 2025. 40:21 It dropped its experimental stage in 314, basically. Yeah. I was going to say, were we all, 40:27 the three of us on the steering council at the same time when we decided to start the experiment 40:30 for free threading? I think Barry wasn't on it. Yeah, I missed a couple of years there, but I'm 40:36 Not sure. 40:36 No, I totally agree. 40:37 I think free threading is one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3, but even maybe more impactful because of the size of the community today. 40:49 Personally, you know, not necessarily speaking as a current or potentially former steering council member. 40:56 We'll see how that shakes out. 40:58 But I think it's inevitable. 41:00 I think free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance. 41:08 I think we just have to do it right. 41:10 And so I talked to lots of teams who are building various software all over the community. 41:16 And I actually think it's more of an educational and maybe an outreach problem than it is a technological problem. 41:23 I mean, yes, there are probably APIs that are missing that will make people's lives easier. 41:30 There's probably some libraries that will make other code a little easier to write or whatever or to understand. 41:36 But like all that's solvable. 41:38 And I think really reaching out to the teams that are, you know, like Thomas said, 41:42 that are building the ecosystem, that are moving the ecosystem to a free threading world. 41:47 That's where we really need to spend our effort on. 41:50 And we'll get there. 41:51 It won't be that long. 41:52 It certainly won't be as long as it took us to get to Python 3. 41:56 I'm sort of curious as someone who's not super experienced with threading or, you know, basic concurrency. 42:04 I mean, I've used it, but I feel like now we have threads, especially with free threading and sub interpreters and multiprocessing and asyncio. 42:14 And I feel like for many people now it's like, oh, my God, which one am I supposed to use? 42:19 And for someone who's experienced, you can sort of say, well, this seems like a better choice. 42:24 But are there any plans to sort of try to have a taxonomy of what problems are solved by which of these? 42:31 The premise here is that everyone would be using one or more of these low-level techniques that you mentioned. 42:37 And I think that's not a good way of looking at it. 42:40 Like AsyncIO is a library that you want to use for the things that AsyncIO is good at. 42:46 And you can actually very nicely combine it with multiprocessing, with subprocesses, with 42:52 so that subprocesses and subinterpreters, just to make it clear that those are two very separate 42:57 things and multithreading, both with and without free threading. 43:01 And it solves different problems or it gives you different abilities within the AsyncIO 43:06 framework. 43:06 And the same is true for like GUI frameworks. 43:09 I mean, GUI frameworks usually want threads for multiple reasons, but you can use these 43:14 other things as well. 43:15 I don't think it's down to teaching end users when to use or avoid all these different things. 43:22 I think we need higher level abstractions for tasks that people want to solve. 43:27 And then those can decide on what for their particular use case is a better approach. 43:33 For instance, PyTorch has multiple. 43:36 So it's used for people who don't know to train, not just train, but it's used in AI 43:42 for generating large matrices and LLMs and what have you. 43:46 Part of it is loading data and processing. 43:49 And the basic ideas of AsyncIO are, oh, you can do all these things in parallel 43:55 because you're not waiting on the CPU, you're just waiting on IO. 43:58 Turns out it is still a good idea to use threads for massively parallel IO 44:02 because otherwise you end up waiting longer than you need to. 44:05 So a problem where we thought AsyncIO would be the solution 44:10 and we never needed threads is actually much improved if we tie in threads as well. 44:15 And we've seen massive, massive improvements in data loader. 44:19 There's even an article, a published article from some people at Meta 44:24 showing how much they improve the PyTorch data loader by using multiple threads. 44:29 But at a very low level, we don't want end users to need to make that choice, right? 44:33 I concur to futures is a good point, right? 44:35 Like all of these approaches are all supported there and it's a unified one. 44:39 So if you were to teach this, for instance, you could say use concurrent.tot futures. 44:42 These are all there. 44:44 This is the potential tradeoff. 44:45 Like basically use threads. 44:46 It's going to be the fastest unless there's like some module you have that's not that's 44:51 screwing up because of threads, then use sub interpreters. 44:53 And if for some reason sub interpreters don't work, you should move to the processing pool, 44:57 the process pool. 44:58 But I mean, basically, you just kind of just like, it's not go sort the fast stuff. 45:02 And for some reason, it doesn't work. 45:03 Use the next fastest and just kind of do it that way. 45:05 After that, then you start to the lower level. 45:08 Like, okay, why do I want to use subinterpreters instead of threads? 45:11 Those kinds of threads. 45:12 But I think that's a different, as I think we're all searching, 45:15 a different level of abstraction, which is a term we keep bringing up today. 45:19 It's a level that a lot of people are not going to have to care about. 45:21 I think the libraries are the ones that are going to have to care about this 45:23 and who are going to do a lot of this for you. 45:25 Let me throw this out on our way out the door to get to Reuven's topic. 45:29 I would love to see it solidify around async and await. 45:33 And you just await a thing, maybe put a decorator on something. 45:36 say this, this one, I want this to be threaded. I want this to be IO. I want this. And you don't, 45:42 you just use async and await and don't have to think about it, but that's, that's my dream. 45:46 Reuven, what's your dream? 45:48 Wow. How long do you have? 45:51 No, what's your topic? 45:52 So I want to talk about Python ecosystem and funding. When I talk to people with Python 45:59 and I talk to them about it, how it's open source, they're like, oh, right, it's open source. That 46:01 means I can download it for free. And from their perspective, that's sort of where it starts 46:05 and ends. And the notion that people work on it, the notion that needs funding, the notion that 46:10 there's a Python software foundation that supports a lot of these activities, the infrastructure 46:15 is completely unknown to them and even quite shocking for them to hear. But Python is in many 46:21 ways, I think, starting to become a victim of its own success, that we've been dependent on 46:27 companies for a number of years to support developers and development. And we've been 46:32 assuming that the PSF, which gives money out to lots of organizations to run conferences and 46:38 workshops and so forth, can sort of keep scaling up and that they will have enough funding. And 46:43 we've seen a few sort of shocks that system in the last year. Most recently, the PSF announced that 46:48 it was no longer going to be doing versus sort of pared down about a year ago, what it would give 46:52 money for. And then about five months ago, six months ago, I think it was in July or August, 46:56 they said, actually, we're not going to be able to fund anything for about a year now. 47:00 And then there was the government grant, I think from the NSF that they turned down. And I'm not disputing the reasons for that at all. It basically, it said, well, we'll give you the money if you don't worry about diversity and inclusion. And given that that's like a core part of what the PSF is supposed to do, they could not do that without shutting the doors, which would be kind of counterproductive. 47:17 And so I feel like we're not yet there, but we're sort of approaching this, I'm going to term like a problem crisis in funding Python. 47:27 The needs of the community keep growing and growing, whether it's workshops, whether it's PyPI, whether it's conferences. 47:32 And companies are getting squeezed. 47:35 And the number of people, it always shocks me every time there are PSF elections, the incredibly small number of people who vote. 47:42 Which means that, let's assume half the people who are members, third of the people. 47:46 Like for the millions and millions of people who program Python out there, an infinitesimally 47:50 small proportion of them actually join and help to fund it. 47:53 So I'm not quite sure what to do with this other than express concern. 47:57 But I feel like we've got to figure out ways to fund Python and the PSF in new ways that 48:01 will allow it to grow and scale as needed. 48:04 I couldn't agree more. 48:06 Obviously, the PSF is close to my heart because I was on the board for, I think, a total of 48:11 six or nine years or something over, you know, the last 25. 48:15 I was also for six months, I was the interim general manager because Eva left and we hadn't 48:21 hired Deb yet while I was on the board. 48:23 I remember signing the sponsor contracts for the companies that came in wanting to sponsor 48:29 Python. 48:29 And it is like, it's ridiculous how, and I can say this working for a company that is 48:35 one of the biggest sponsors of the PSF and has done so for years. 48:38 It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they 48:45 came in because every single one has such a big impact. 48:48 You can do so much good with the money that comes in. 48:52 We need more corporate sponsorships more than we need. 48:55 Like, I mean, obviously a million people giving us a couple of bucks, giving the PSF, let's 49:00 be clear. 49:00 I'm not on the board anymore. 49:01 Giving the PSF a couple of bucks would be fantastic. 49:05 But I think the big players in the big corporate players where all the AI money is, for instance, 49:12 having done basically no sponsorship of the PSF is mind-boggling. It is a textbook 49:18 tragedy of the commons right there, right? They rely entirely on PyPI and PyPI is run entirely 49:25 with community resources, mostly because of very generous and consistent sponsorship, 49:31 basically by Fastly, but also the other sponsors of the PSF. And yet very large players use those 49:38 resources more than anyone else and don't actually contribute. Georgie Kerr, she wrote this fantastic 49:45 blog post saying pretty much this straight after Europython. So Europython this year was really big 49:52 actually. And she was wandering around looking at the sponsor booths and the usual players were there, 49:57 but none of these AI companies were there. And the relationship actually between AI, if you want to 50:03 call it that. Let's call it ML and neural networks. And like some of the really big companies and 50:09 Python actually is really complex. Obviously, a lot of these companies and some of us are here, 50:15 employ people to work on Python. Companies like Meta and Google have contributed massively to 50:21 frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras. So it's not as simple a picture as saying cough up money 50:27 all the time. Like there's a more complex picture here, but definitely there are some notable 50:32 absences. And we talked about the volume of money going through. I totally agree with the sentiment. 50:39 When the shortfall came and the grants program had to shut down, we were brainstorming at JetBrains, 50:45 like maybe we can do some sort of, I don't know, donate some more money and call other companies 50:51 to do it. Or we can call on people in the community. And I was like, I don't want to call 50:55 on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also 50:59 donating their time for Python. Like it's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves 51:05 to this community even more. And it's not sustainable. Like Reuben said, if we keep doing 51:10 this, the whole community is going to collapse. Like I'm sure we've all had our own forms of 51:16 burnout from giving too much. I'm going to pat ourselves on the back here. Everyone on this 51:19 call who works at a company are all sponsors of the PSF. Thank goodness. But there's obviously a 51:25 lot of people not on this call who are not sponsors. And I know personally, I wished every 51:29 company that generated revenue from python usage donated to the psf like and it doesn't see and i 51:35 think part of the problem is some people think it has to be like a hundred thousand dollars it does 51:38 not have to be a hundred thousand dollars now if you can afford that amount please do or more there 51:43 are many ways to donate more than the maximum amount for getting on the website but it's one 51:48 of these funny things where a lot of people just like oh it's not me right like even startups don't 51:51 some do to give those ones credit but others don't because like oh we're we're burning through 51:56 capital level i was like yeah but we're not we're asking for like less so you'd pay a dev right by 52:01 a lot per year right like the amount we actually asked for to get to the highest tier is still less 52:07 than a common developer in silicon valley if we're gonna price point to a geograph geogra geographical 52:13 location we call kind of comprehend i'm gonna steal a net bachelor's observation here and yeah what 52:18 the psf would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every 52:25 year. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a long running problem, right? Like, I mean, I've been on the PSF for a 52:31 long time, too. I've not served as many years as Thomas on the board, but I was like executive 52:36 vice president because we had to have someone with that title at some point. It's always been a 52:40 struggle, right? Like I and I also want to be clear, I'm totally appreciative of where we have 52:45 gotten to, right? Because for the longest time, I was just dying for paid staff on the core team. 52:50 And now we have three developers as residents. Thank goodness. Still not enough to be clear. 52:55 I want five. 52:56 And I've always said that, but I'll happily take three. 52:58 But it's one of these things where it's a constant struggle. 53:00 And it got a little bit better before the pandemic 53:03 just because everyone was spending on conferences 53:05 and PyCon US is a big driver for the Python Software Foundation. 53:08 And I know your Python's a driver for the European Society. 53:12 But then COVID hit and conferences haven't picked back up. 53:15 And then there's a whole new cohort of companies that have come in post-pandemic 53:19 that have never had that experience of going to PyCon and sponsoring PyCon. 53:22 And so they don't think about, I think, sponsoring PyCon 53:25 the PSF because that's also a big kind of in your face, you should help sponsor this. 53:29 And I think it's led to this kind of lull where offered spending has gone down, new entrants 53:33 into the community have not had that experience and thought about it. And it's led to this kind 53:37 of dearth where, yeah, that PSF had to stop giving out grant money. And it sucks. And I would love 53:43 to see it not be that problem. I want to add one interesting data point that I discovered in 53:47 short. Keep it short. Yes. NumFocus has about twice the budget of the PSF. I was shocked to 53:53 discover this. So basically it is possible to get money from companies to sponsor development of 54:00 Python related projects. And I don't know what they're doing that we aren't. And I think it's 54:05 worth talking and figuring it out. We need a fundraiser and marketer in residence, maybe. Who 54:10 knows? Lauren does a great job, to be clear. The PSF has Lauren and Lauren is that. But it's still 54:18 hard. We have someone doing it full time at the PSF and it's just hard to get companies to give 54:22 cash up cash. 54:23 Yeah, and what do we get in return? 54:25 Well, we already get that. 54:26 So, yeah, I know. 54:27 All right, Barry. 54:28 To just, you know, shift gears into a different area, 54:32 something that I've been thinking a lot over this past year on the steering council. 54:36 Thomas, I'm sure, is going to be, you know, very well aware, 54:39 having been instrumental in the lazy imports PEP A10. 54:45 We have to sort of rethink how we evolve Python 54:50 and how we pose changes to Python and how we discuss those changes in the community. 54:56 Because I think one of the things that I have heard over and over and over again is that authoring PEPs 55:04 is incredibly difficult and emotionally draining and it's a time sink. 55:11 And leading those discussions on discuss.python.org, which we typically call DPO, 55:18 can be toxic at times and very difficult. 55:21 So one of the things that I realized as I was thinking about this 55:25 is that peps are 25 years old now, right? 55:29 So we've had this, and not only just peps are old, 55:33 but like we've gone through at least two, if not more sort of complete revolutions 55:38 in the way we discuss things. 55:40 You know, the community has grown incredibly. 55:43 The developer community is somewhat larger, but just the number of people 55:47 who are using Python and who have an interest in it has grown exponentially. So it has become 55:54 really difficult to evolve the language in the standard library and the interpreter. And we need 56:01 to sort of think about how we can make this easier for people and not lose the voice of the user. 56:09 And the number of people who actually engage in topics on DPO is the tip of the iceberg. You know, 56:14 We've got millions and millions of users out there in the world who, for example, lazy imports will affect, free threading will affect and don't even know that they have a voice. 56:24 And maybe we have to basically represent that, but we have to do it in a much more collaborative and positive way. 56:31 That's something that I've been thinking about a lot. 56:33 And whether or not I'm on the steering council next year, I think this is something that I'm going to spend some time on trying to think about, you know, talk to people about ways we can make this easier for everyone. 56:43 The diversity of use cases for Python in the last couple of years. 56:47 So complex. 56:48 Yes, exactly. 56:49 It should also be preface that Barry created the PEP process. He should have started that one. 56:55 It is that old. 56:57 Yeah. 56:58 By the way, just so everyone knows, these are not ages jokes to be mean to Barry. 57:02 We've always known Barry long enough that we know Barry's okay with us making these jokes. 57:07 To be very, very clear. 57:07 Also, I am almost as old as Barry, although I don't look as old as Barry. 57:12 Yeah, we're all over from the same age anyways. 57:15 Yeah, Barry and I have known each other for 25 years, 57:18 and I've always made these jokes of him. 57:21 So it is different when you know each other in person. 57:26 Let's put it that way. 57:28 For the PEP process, I think for a lot of people, it's not obvious how difficult the process is. 57:35 I mean, it wasn't even obvious to me. 57:37 I saw people avoiding writing peps multiple times, and I was upset, like on the steering council, right? 57:43 I saw people making changes where I thought, this is definitely something 57:47 that should have been discussed in a PEP and the discussion should be recorded in a PEP and all that. 57:51 And I didn't understand why they didn't until, basically until PEP 8.10. 57:56 So I did PEP 779, which was the giving free threading supported status 58:02 at the start of the year. 58:03 And the discussion there was, you know, sort of as expected and it's already, 58:08 was already an accepted PEP. 58:10 It was just the question of how does it become supported? 58:12 That one wasn't too exhausting. 58:14 And then we got to Lazy Imports, which was Pablo, who is another steering council member, 58:20 as well as a bunch of other contributors, including me and two of my co-workers and 58:24 one of my former co-workers, who had all had a lot of experience with Lazy Imports, but 58:29 not necessarily as much experience with the PEP process. 58:32 And Pablo took the front seat because he knew the PEP process and he's done like five PEPs 58:37 in the last year or something, some ridiculous number. 58:40 And he shared with us the vitriol he got for like offline for the, just the audacity of proposing 58:49 something that people disagreed with or something. And that was like, this is a technical suggestion. 58:54 This is not a code of conduct issue where I have received my fair share of vitriol around. 59:00 This is a technical discussion. And yet he gets this, these ridiculous accusations in his mailbox. 59:06 And for some reason, only the primary author gets it as well, which is just weird to me. 59:12 But people are lazy. 59:13 Thomas is what I think you just said. 59:15 Remember, the steering council exists because Guido was the got the brunt of this for Pet 572, which was the walrus operator. 59:24 Right. Which is just like this minor little syntactic thing that is kind of cool when you need it. 59:31 But like just the amount of anger and negative energy and vitriol that he got over that was enough to for him to just say, I'm out, you know, and you guys figure it out. 59:42 And that cannot be an acceptable way to discuss the evolution of the language. 59:48 Especially since apparently now every single PEP author of any contentious or semi contentious pep. 59:55 Although I have to say, Pep 810 had such broad support. 59:59 It was hard to call it contentious. 01:00:01 It's just there's a couple of very loud opinions, I guess. 01:00:04 And I'm not saying we shouldn't listen to people. 01:00:06 We should definitely listen to especially contrary opinions. 01:00:11 But there has to be a limit. 01:00:12 There has to be an acceptable way of bringing things up. 01:00:15 There has to be an acceptable way of saying, hey, you didn't actually read the Pep. 01:00:21 please go back and reconsider everything you said after you fully digested the things, 01:00:27 because everything's already been addressed in the pep. 01:00:29 It's just really hard to do this in a way that doesn't destroy the relationship with the person you're telling this, right? 01:00:37 It's hard to tell people, hey, I'm not going to listen to you because you haven't, you know, you've done a bad job. 01:00:44 You've chosen not to inform yourself. 01:00:46 I think you make another really strong point, Thomas, which is that there have been changes that have been made to Python that really should have been a pep. 01:00:55 And they aren't because people don't want to go through core developers, don't want to go through this gauntlet. 01:01:01 And so they'll create a PR and then that. 01:01:03 But that's also not good because then, you know, we don't have that. 01:01:06 We don't have the right level of consideration. 01:01:11 And you think about the way that, you know, if you're in your job and you're making a change to something in your job, you have a very close relationship to your teammates. 01:01:20 And so you have that kind of respect and hopefully, right, like compassion and consideration. 01:01:26 And you can have a very productive discussion about a thing and you may win some arguments and you may lose some arguments, but the team moves forward as one. 01:01:35 And I think we've lost a bit of that in Python. 01:01:38 So that's not great. 01:01:40 I think society in general could use a little more civility and kindness, especially to strangers that they haven't met in forums, social media, driving, you name it. 01:01:50 Okay, but we're not going to solve that here, I'm sure. 01:01:54 So instead, let's do Gregory's topic. 01:01:57 Hey, I'm going to change topics quite a bit, but I wanted to call 2025 the year of type checking and language server protocols. 01:02:04 So many of us probably have used tools like mypy to check to see if the types line up in our code or whether or not we happen to be overriding functions correctly. 01:02:14 And so I've used mypy for many years and loved the tool and had a great opportunity to chat with the creator of it. 01:02:20 And I integrate that into my CI and it's really been wonderful. 01:02:24 And I've also been using a lot of LSPs, like, for example, PyRite or PyLands. 01:02:28 But in this year, one of the things that we've seen is, number one, Pyrefly from the team at Meta. 01:02:34 We've also seen ty from the team at Astral. 01:02:36 And there's another one called Zubon. 01:02:38 And Zubon is from David Halter. 01:02:41 David was also the person who created JEDI, which is another system in Python that helped with a lot of LSP tasks. 01:02:48 What's interesting about all three of the tools that I just mentioned 01:02:51 is that they're implemented in Rust, and they have taken a lot of the opportunity to make the type checker 01:02:58 and or the LSP significantly faster. 01:03:01 So for me, this has changed how I use the LSP or the type checker and how frequently I use it. 01:03:07 And in my experience, it has helped me to take things that might take tens of seconds or hundreds of seconds and cut them down often to less than a second. 01:03:17 And it's really changed the way in which I'm using a lot of the tools like ty or Pyrefly or Zubon. 01:03:24 So I can have some more details if I'm allowed to share, Michael, but I would say 2025 is the year of type checkers and LSPs. 01:03:31 I think given the timing, let's have people give some feedback. 01:03:34 I personally have been using Pyrefly a ton and am a big fan of it. 01:03:38 I don't know if I'm allowed to have an opinion that isn't Pyrefly is awesome. 01:03:43 I mean, I'm not on the Pyrefly team, but I do regularly chat with people from the Pyrefly team. 01:03:49 Tell people real quick what it is, Thomas. 01:03:51 So Pyrefly is Meta's attempt at a Rust-based type checker. 01:03:56 And so it's very similar to ty. 01:03:58 Started basically at the same time, a little later. 01:04:01 Meta originally had a type checker called Pyre, which was written in OCaml. 01:04:06 They basically decided to start a rewrite in Rust. 01:04:09 And then that really took off. 01:04:11 And that's where we're going now. 01:04:13 Yeah. 01:04:14 Yeah. 01:04:14 I don't know what I can say because I'm actually on the same team as the Pylands team. 01:04:18 So, but no, I mean, I think it's good. 01:04:21 I think this is one of those interesting scenarios where some people realize like, 01:04:25 you know what, we're going to pay the penalty of writing a tool in a way that's faster, 01:04:30 but makes us go slower because the overall win for the community 01:04:33 is going to be a good win. 01:04:34 So it's worth that headache, right? 01:04:36 Not to say I don't want to scare people off from writing Rust, but let's be honest, 01:04:39 it takes more work to write Rust code than it does take to write Python code. 01:04:42 But some people chose to make that trade off and we're all benefiting from it. 01:04:46 The one thing I will say that's kind of interesting from this 01:04:48 that hasn't gotten a lot of play yet because it's still being developed, 01:04:51 But PyLens is actually working with the Pyrefly team to define a type server protocol, TSP, so that a lot of these type servers can just kind of feed the type information to a higher level LSP and let that LSP handle the stuff like symbol renaming and all that stuff. 01:05:05 Right. Because the key thing here and the reason there's so many different type checkers is there are there is a spec. 01:05:12 Right. And everyone's trying to implement it. But there's differences like in type in terms of type inferencing. 01:05:16 And if I actually go listen to Michael's interview, talk Python to me with the Pyrefly team, 01:05:21 they actually did a nice little explanation of the difference between Pyrites approach 01:05:25 and Pyrefly's approach. 01:05:27 And so there's a bit of variance. 01:05:28 But for instance, I think there's some talk now of trying to like, how do we make it 01:05:32 so everyone doesn't have to reimplement how to rename a symbol, right? 01:05:35 That's kind of boring. 01:05:35 That's not where the interesting work is. 01:05:37 And that's not performant from perspective of you want instantaneously to get that squiggly red line 01:05:43 in whether it's VS Code or it's in PyCharm or whatever your editor is, right? 01:05:48 You want to get it as fast as possible, but the rename- 01:05:51 Jupyter. 01:05:52 Jupyter. 01:05:52 No, not Emacs. 01:05:53 Everything but Emacs. 01:05:53 No, not Emacs. 01:05:56 Just to bring things full circle, it's that focus on user experience, right? 01:06:00 Which is, yes, you want that squiggly line, but when things go wrong, 01:06:04 when your type checker says, oh, you've got a problem, 01:06:07 you know, like I think about as an analogy, how Pablo has done an amazing amount of work 01:06:14 on the error reporting, right? 01:06:15 When you get an exception and, you know, now you have a lot more clues about what is it that I actually have to change to make the tool, you know, to fix the problem, right? 01:06:26 Like so many times years ago, you know, when people were using mypy, for example, and they'd have some complex failure of their type annotations and have absolutely no idea what to do about it. 01:06:40 And so getting to a place where now we're not just telling people you've done it wrong, 01:06:44 but also here's some ideas about how to fix it. 01:06:49 I think this is a full circle here because honestly, using typing in your Python code 01:06:54 gives a lot of context to the AI when you ask for help. 01:06:57 If you just give it a fragment and it can't work with it. 01:06:59 That's true. 01:07:00 And also, if you can teach your AI agent to use the type checkers and use the LSPs, 01:07:06 it will also generate better code for you. 01:07:09 I think the one challenge I would add to what Barry said a moment ago is that if you're a developer and you're using, say, three or four type checkers at the same time, you also have to be careful about the fact that some of them won't flag an error that the other one will flag. 01:07:24 So I've recently written Python programs and even built a tool with one of my students named Benedek that will automatically generate Python programs that will cause type checkers to disagree with each other. 01:07:39 I will flag it as an error, but none of the other tools will flag it as an error. 01:07:45 And there are also cases where the new tools will all agree with each other, but disagree with mypy. 01:07:50 So there is a type checker conformance test suite. 01:07:53 But I think as developers, even though it might be the year of LSP and type checker, 01:07:57 we also have to be aware of the fact that these tools are maturing and there's still disagreement among them. 01:08:03 and also just different philosophies when it comes to how to type check and how to infer. 01:08:08 And so we have to think about all of those things as these tools mature and become part of our ecosystem. 01:08:12 Yeah, Greg, that last point is important. 01:08:14 Out of curiosity, how did the things where the type checkers disagree 01:08:18 match up with the actual runtime behavior of Python? 01:08:21 Was it like false positives or false negatives? 01:08:24 That's a really good question. 01:08:26 I'll give you more details in the show notes because we actually have it in a GitHub repository 01:08:30 and I can share it with people. 01:08:31 But I think some of it might simply be related to cases where mypy is more conformant to the spec, but the other new tools are not as conformant. 01:08:43 So you can import overload from typing and then have a very overloaded function. 01:08:48 And mypy will actually flag the fact that it's an overloaded function with multiple signatures, whereas PyRite and Pyrefly and Zubon will not actually flag that, even though they should. 01:09:00 Another big area is optional versus not optional. 01:09:03 Yes. 01:09:03 Like, are you allowed to pass a thing that is an optional string when the thing accepts a string? 01:09:09 Some stuff's like, yeah, it's probably fine. 01:09:10 Others are like, no, no, no. 01:09:11 This is an error that you have to do a check. 01:09:13 And if you want to switch type checkers, you might end up with a thousand warnings that you didn't previously had because of an intentional difference of opinion on how strict to be, I think. 01:09:23 Yeah. 01:09:23 So you have to think about false positives and false negatives when you're willing to break the build because of a type error. 01:09:29 All of those things are things you have to factor in. 01:09:31 But to go quickly to this connection to AI, I know it's only recently, but the Pyrefly 01:09:37 team actually announced that they're making Pyrefly work directly with Pydantic AI. 01:09:42 So there's going to be an interoperability between those tools so that when you're building 01:09:46 an AI agent using Pydantic AI, you can also then have better guarantees when you're using 01:09:52 Pyrefly as your type checker. 01:09:53 It makes total sense, though, because then the reasoning LLM that's at the core of the 01:09:57 agent can actually have that information before it tries to execute the code and you don't get in that 01:10:04 loop that they often get in. You can correct it before it runs. Yeah, really good point. I want to 01:10:09 just sort of express my appreciation to all the people working on this typing stuff. As someone 01:10:14 who's come from many, many years in dynamic languages, I was always like, oh, typing. Those 01:10:27 E, I love seeing how easy it is for people to ease into it when they're in Python. 01:10:32 It's not all or nothing. 01:10:34 C, I love the huge number of tools. 01:10:36 The competition in this space is really exciting. 01:10:39 And D, guess what? 01:10:40 It really, really does help. 01:10:42 And I'll even add an E, which is my students who come from Java, C++, C#, and so forth 01:10:47 feel relief. 01:10:48 They find that without type checking, it's like doing a trapeze act without a safety 01:10:53 net. 01:10:53 And so they're very happy to have that typing in there, 01:10:57 typings in there. 01:10:58 So kudos to everyone. 01:10:59 All right, folks, we are out of time. 01:11:00 This could literally go for hours longer. 01:11:04 It was a big year. 01:11:05 It was a big year, but I think we need to just have a final word. 01:11:10 I'll start and we'll just go around. 01:11:12 So my final thought here is, we've talked about some things that are negatives 01:11:17 or sort of downers or whatever here and there, but I still think it's an incredibly exciting time 01:11:22 To be a developer, data scientist, there's so much opportunity out there. 01:11:26 There's so many things to learn and take advantage of and stay on top of. 01:11:29 And amazing. 01:11:30 Every day is slightly more amazing than the previous day. 01:11:33 So I love it. 01:11:34 Gregory, let's go to you next. 01:11:35 Let's go around the circle. 01:11:35 Yeah, I wanted to give a shout out to all of the local Python conferences. 01:11:40 I actually, on a regular basis, have attended the PyOhio conference. 01:11:44 And it is incredible. 01:11:45 The organizers do an absolutely amazing job. 01:11:49 And they have it hosted on a campus, oftentimes at Ohio State or Cleveland State University. 01:11:54 And incredibly, PyOhio is a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee. 01:12:01 So Michael, on a comment that I think is really positive, wow, I'm so excited about the regional 01:12:06 Python conferences that I've been able to attend. 01:12:08 Thomas. 01:12:09 Wow, I didn't expect this. 01:12:10 So I think I want to give a shout out to new people joining the community and also joining 01:12:16 just core developer team as triagers or it's just drive by commenters. I know we harped a little bit 01:12:22 about people, you know, giving strong opinions and discussions, but I always look to the far future 01:12:27 as well as the near future. And we always need new people. We need new ideas. We need new opinions. So 01:12:33 yeah, I'm, I'm excited that there's still people joining and signing up and even when it's 01:12:39 thankless work. So I guess I want to say thank you to people doing all the thankless work. Jodi. 01:12:44 Yeah, I want to say this is actually really only my third year or so really in the Python community. 01:12:52 So before that, I was just sort of on the fringes, right? 01:12:54 And after I started advocacy, I started going to the conferences and meeting people. 01:12:58 And I think I didn't kind of get how special the community was until I watched the Python documentary this year. 01:13:04 And I talked to Paul about this, Paul Everett afterwards, also made fun of him for his like early 2000s fashion. 01:13:11 but I think, yeah, like I'm a relative newcomer to this community and you've all made me feel so 01:13:18 welcome. And I guess I want to thank all the incumbents for everything you've done to make 01:13:24 this such a special tech community for minorities and everyone, newbies, you know, Python, 01:13:30 Python is love. Oh, geez. How am I supposed to follow that? 01:13:37 I think one of the interesting things that we're kind of looping on here is 01:13:41 I think the language evolution has slowed down, but it's obviously not stopped, right? 01:13:45 Like as Thomas pointed out, there's a lot more stuff happening behind the scenes. 01:13:49 Lazy imports are coming, and that was a syntactic change, which apparently brings out the mean side of some people. 01:13:55 And we've obviously got our challenges and stuff, but things are still going. 01:13:58 We're still looking along. 01:13:59 We're still trying to be an open, welcoming place for people like Jody and everyone else who's new coming on over 01:14:05 and to continue to be a fun place for all of us slightly grain-beard people who have been here for a long time 01:14:11 to make us want to stick around. 01:14:12 I think it's just more of the same, honestly. 01:14:15 It's all of us just continuing to do what we can to help out to keep this community being a great place. 01:14:20 And it all just keeps going forward. 01:14:22 And I'll just end with, if you work for a company that's not sponsored the PSF, 01:14:26 please do so. 01:14:26 It's rare to have, I mean, a programming language or any sort of tool 01:14:32 where it is both really, really beneficial to your career 01:14:36 and you get to hang out with really special, nice, interesting people. 01:14:40 And it's easy to take all that for granted if you've been steeped in the community. 01:14:45 I went to a conference about six months ago, a non-Python conference. 01:14:49 And that was shocking to me to discover that all the speakers were from advertisers and sponsors. 01:14:55 Everything was super commercialized. 01:14:57 People were not interested in just like hanging out and sharing with each other. 01:15:00 And it was a shock to me because I've been to basically only Python conferences for so many years. 01:15:05 I was like, oh, that's not the norm in the industry. 01:15:08 So we've got something really special going that not only is good for the people, but good for everyone's careers and mutually reinforcing and helping each other. 01:15:16 And that's really fantastic. 01:15:17 And we should appreciate that. 01:15:19 Barry, final word. 01:15:20 Thomas stole my thunder just a little bit, but just to tie a couple of these ideas together. 01:15:25 Python, and you know, Brett said this, right? 01:15:29 This is Python is the community or the community is Python. 01:15:33 There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. 01:15:38 Python is what we make it. 01:15:40 And, you know, as folks like myself get a little older and, you know, and we have younger people 01:15:47 coming into the community, both developers and everything else 01:15:51 who are shaping Python into their vision. 01:15:54 I encourage you, if you've thought about becoming a core dev, 01:15:58 find a mentor. 01:15:59 There are people out there that will help you. 01:16:01 If you want to be involved in the community, the PSF, you know, reach out. 01:16:06 There are people who will help guide you this community. You can be involved. Do not let any self-imposed limitations stop you from 01:16:16 becoming part of the Python community in the way that you want to. And eventually run for the 01:16:22 steering council because we need many, many, many more candidates next year. And you don't need any 01:16:29 qualifications either because I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. 01:16:34 And look at me. 01:16:35 And I have a PhD and I will tell you, I did not need all that to become a Python developer 01:16:39 because I was the Python developer before I got the PhD. 01:16:42 I'm a bass player. 01:16:43 So if I can do it, anybody can do it. 01:16:47 Thank you everyone for being here. 01:16:49 This awesome look back in the air and I really appreciate you all taking the time. 01:16:52 Thank you, Michael. 01:16:53 Thanks everybody. 01:16:54 Bye everybody. 01:16:57 This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me. 01:17:00 Thank you to our sponsors. 01:17:01 Be sure to check out what they're offering. 01:17:02 It really helps support the show. 01:17:04 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:17:08 Sentry's Seer AI Code Review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:17:13 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:17:18 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:17:20 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:17:25 If you or your team needs to learn Python, we have over 270 hours of beginner and advanced courses 01:17:30 on topics ranging from complete beginners to async code, Flask, Django, HTMX, and even LLMs. 01:17:37 Best of all, there's no subscription in sight. 01:17:40 Browse the catalog at talkpython.fm. 01:17:42 And if you're not already subscribed to the show on your favorite podcast player, 01:17:46 what are you waiting for? 01:17:47 Just search for Python in your podcast player. 01:17:49 We should be right at the top. 01:17:51 If you enjoy that geeky rap song, you can download the full track. 01:17:54 The link is actually in your podcast blur show notes. 01:17:56 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 01:17:58 Thank you so much for listening. 01:17:59 I really appreciate it. 01:18:01 I'll see you next time. 01:18:27 I think is the norm.

Title: Forecasting the world in 2026: Will Trump win the Nobel peace prize? Will Starmer survive?

Full Content:
The world on the brink of 2026 seems an especially unpredictable and unsettling place. Nonetheless, our team of crystal-ball gazers in The Irish Times have weighed in on what they think will happen in global affairs over the coming 12 months. Will they be right? We’ll find out next year. If you think you can do better than the experts, try submitting your predictions online – at the end of this article – and we’ll compare notes in 12 months, with a prize for our top performer. Happy 2026! – Carl O’Brien, Foreign Editor Yes. Though what form it will take is not clear, and whether it will hold is another matter. US president Donald Trump claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day, and is impatient over the continued absence of a peace agreement. Kyiv feels like it is now only one Trump tantrum away from losing US support entirely – including the military aid and intelligence that are a vital part of its war effort. Europe could fill many, if not all the holes, that an end to US support would leave, but Ukraine sees that Europe is divided and desperate to avoid confrontation with Trump. Add in Russia’s slow but relentless advance on the eastern battlefield, and Ukraine is more likely than not to have to agree to some sort of peace plan in 2026. Daniel McLaughlin, Eastern Europe Correspondent No. There are signs that carbon emissions are peaking but the expectation is they will plateau for at least a few years before slowly reducing. Much depends on China, which is on the cusp of cutting its emissions. But rising emissions elsewhere – the United States, India and Russia – would negate any early progress Beijing can orchestrate. Renewable energy is increasing but energy demand is growing as fast as renewables can expand, if not faster. Rapid growth in AI, increased air conditioning and refrigeration to counteract rising heat, the swelling world population and an expanding global middle class with an appetite for cars and consumer goods all require extra energy and fossil fuels are growing to supply it. If wildfires are as severe in the next 12 months as they have been in the past few years, they will also cancel out the efforts of countries that are actually reducing emissions. Caroline O’Doherty, Climate and Science Correspondent No. It is a marginal call and some Labour MPs believe he might scrape through, but I do not expect Starmer to be able to stand up in the political winds that will blow in 2026. Wales is a write-off for Labour and its 100-year grip on politics there will likely end in devolved parliament elections in May. Labour is also on course to lose in Scotland. But it could be London that finally does Starmer in. London council elections are due on the same day as the Welsh/Scottish votes. If the resurgent Greens eat into Labour’s London vote from the left, and Reform UK erodes it from the right, Starmer may be caught in an unsurvivable pincer grip. He will take the blame for everything. Starmer has been written off before and survived. But it would be a big surprise is he made it past the summer. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. A row over Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s suggestion that her country could go to war to defend Taiwan has heightened tensions over the self-governing island. Beijing’s policy is to pursue unification, by force if necessary, and some analysts believe that Xi Jinping has been amping up the rhetoric to prepare the Chinese people for military action. Others think that Donald Trump would not send US forces to defend Taiwan, offering a Beijing a once in a lifetime opportunity to launch an invasion. But the island’s topography is such that an amphibious landing would be the most ambitious such operation in military history. And although the People’s Liberation Army is armed with the most advanced weapons technology, they have not been involved in a hot war since the 1970s. More likely are grey zone operations that make life difficult for the island but fall short of a blockade, which would be an act of war. Although polls show an overwhelming majority of Taiwanese oppose unification with the Chinese mainland, parties that want warmer relations with Beijing are gaining popularity. Denis Staunton, China Correspondent No. God, no. This is not merely a sporting endeavour for the land of hope and glory. It is about identity, esteem, obsession and neurosis. It means so much to the English, I believe – nay, as a facetious Irishman, hope – they will bottle it. The quest for a second World Cup 60 years after their first (and a mere aeon since they started talking about it) consumes the English like a case of national dysentery. That they go to the 2026 world cup with their hopes pinned on a German, England manager Thomas Tuchel, makes it worse. If England does win, nothing else will matter. Planets may collide, the seas may rise and a cow might jump over the moon. Keir Starmer could even survive as prime minister. The English won’t care – they will dance in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. It cannot be. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. The US military build-up off Venezuela is formidable but nowhere near enough for an invasion. The current force is just one tenth the size of that which invaded Iraq in 2003 over land from Washington’s willing client Kuwait. A sea and air invasion of the much larger Venezuela would demand far more military assets than the war-averse president Trump is likely to sanction. The goal instead looks to be to try to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro into fleeing or provoke a coup against him from within his Chavista movement. Trump might also be attracted by the option of an opportunistic air strike. That risk-reward ratio would likely appeal far more to Trump than undertaking his country’s first invasion of a South American state. Tom Hennigan Yes. This year United States financial markets continued a years-long rally, shrugging off the disruption of the Trump administration’s tariffs and broader global uncertainty. The benchmark S&P index of US stocks has hit a record high, part of a years-long rally that began in spring 2022. Just a handful of companies account for most of this growth: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla. Together, they account for about a third of the S&P’s total value and a huge proportion of trading is just in the shares of those seven companies. Much of the rally is fuelled by hopes about the economic promise of AI. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in computing power and data centres to enable AI, which is hugely energy-hungry, but the expected revenues have largely failed to materialise. I’m convinced that the market for an over-hyped technology is not sustainable or resilient to the shocks of a more dangerous world, and is over-concentrated in just a few companies and centred around an over-hyped technology. Expecting the US stock market as a whole to always end up higher in the long run is based on a century of growth in which the US became the dominant global power and the living standards of its citizens were transformed. I’m not convinced the same can be expected of the next century. Naomi O’Leary No. It’s not impossible, but his chances are dimming. Much has happened since María Corina Machado, this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner and the opposition leader in Venezuela, said in October that she is “grateful” for president Trump’s international diplomacy efforts. A fragile peace process continues to hold in Gaza. Against that, the US administration’s attempts to pressure Ukraine into an abomination of a peace deal with Russia and Trump’s continued emboldening of Vladimir Putin are facilitating the sense of threat sweeping through Europe. [ Venezuela’s Machado is backing Trump against Maduro - allies say they’ve tried everything elseOpens in new window ] The Nobel chair said Machado was recognised for her struggle to “achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”. Trump’s political opponents within the US habitually present his administration as a threat to the tenets of democracy there, and the global disapproval of the peace prize awarded by Fifa president Gianni Infantino may dissuade the Nobel committee from entertaining his claims to the prize. But the Nobel Peace Prize honour roll is flawed and contentious and Trump will start 2026 as the bookies’ favourite. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. Germany’s car industry admits it missed the early turn-off to electric mobility. In 2022, VW, BMW and Mercedes looked on in horror as Elon Musk planted his first European factory just outside the gates of Berlin. But Germany’s car industry is not worried about Tesla any more. Instead, its eyes are fixed on a far more serious rival from the east. Chinese car giant BYD has its roots in batteries but now the auto division of Build Your Dreams is the stuff of nightmares for German car executives. After creeping into position in recent years, quietly attracting a loyal and price-conscious customer base in Europe, the Chinese company will move into high gear in October 2027. Its new factory in Hungary, with an initial capacity of 150,000 vehicles annually, will allow the Chinese firm circumvent EU tariffs on Chinese cars. Brussels describes the levies as a response to unfair state subsidies for its car companies. Not a moment too soon, VW will present its own entry-level EV next year, manufactured in Spain and starting at €25,000. If Germany’s car industry is to have a future, and the German economy with it, then this is the make-or-break moment. Derek Scally, Berlin Correspondent Yes – but only just. The US president is determined to begin phase two of the ceasefire in the new year but the challenges are immense, and 53 per cent of Israelis believe the war against Hamas will restart in 2026. Israeli forces remain in control of just over half of Gaza, along a “temporary” yellow line, which Israel’s top general termed a “new border” that would serve as a “forward defensive line for our communities”. There has been almost no discernible progress on any of the key elements of phase two of the ceasefire: Hamas remains dominant, albeit weakened, resisting calls to disarm; the militant group has still to return the body of the last remaining hostage; recruiting an international stabilisation force is problematic; Israel rejects any role for Turkey. In addition, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has still to carry out reforms; Israel rejects a role for the PA; and donors are reluctant to commit with so much uncertainty. Mark Weiss in Jerusalem Yes. As the year ends, Donald Trump’s presidential approval rating has tanked and the inflation crisis that dogged the Biden/Harris election campaign is now swamping the current administration, while Maga discontent is simmering over the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. The recent special elections in Virginia and New Jersey hinted at voting patterns in next year’s midterms. Internal tensions, symbolised by the disaffection of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the refusal by the Indiana state senate to accede to redistricting requests, and December’s candid Vanity Fair interview by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, all hint at an administration fragmenting. [ Amid ominous polls, Republicans start to express dissent towards Trump for the first timeOpens in new window ] But Republican efforts to manipulate the election process through a March executive order (blocked by the courts) to produce passports in order to vote, the continuing redistricting efforts, and fears that federal troops will be used in an attempt to deter voter turnout clouds all reasonable forecasts. The general consensus is that the number of winnable “Republican” seats is much smaller in 2026 than it was in the Democratic blue wave of 2018, and that gerrymandering on both sides has reduced the number of competitive districts. But nonetheless, the Democrats should retake the House majority. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. An irony – no doubt not lost on the newly-Catholic US vice-president JD Vance – is that the leader of his church (and an American), Pope Leo XIV, is increasingly seen as the world leader who is most outspoken and consistent in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration. This is likely to be even more the case in 2026. While other heads of state, prime ministers and dictators bow before Trump, fearing his deployment of tariffs, arms or the US Navy, Leo has done the opposite. From the beginning of his papacy, he has publicly criticised Trump’s treatment of migrants, his splitting with Europe, the betrayal of Ukraine, his threats to Venezuela, not to mention the US-enabled “barbarity” in Gaza. Asked about this in early December, Trump commented: “I’m sure he’s a lovely man. His brother’s [Louis] a lovely man ... Do you know his brother is serious Maga?” The US president, however, is likely to find he is dealing with a very different kettle of fish in “brother” Leo XIV. Patsy McGarry Yes. Although you will probably hear a lot of bluster from the Trump administration in 2026 about how the European Union’s regulations on big tech are unfair, it is unlikely this pushback will threaten the deal Brussels and Washington struck on tariffs. The EU agreed to 15 per cent tariffs on future goods sold into the US. EU negotiators blinked first, meaning we won’t know if Trump would have followed through on threats to hit Europe with cripplingly high import taxes, sparking a proper transatlantic trade war. Trump was able to sell the deal as a win for his radical tariff agenda. He seems content to bank it, even though his tariffs have put domestic prices and farmers under pressure. European politicians have been desperate to keep Trump onside as an ally of Ukraine, meaning they certainly won’t be the ones to rip up the tariff deal.

Title: From AI To SPO: The Top 10 AdExchanger Guest Columns Of 2025

Competition between DSPs and SSPs was extra spicy this year. The Trade Desk’s aggressive posture against SSPs – which it branded as “resellers” contributing little to the programmatic supply chain – sparked countless hot takes on ad industry social media channels and in AdExchanger columns. Thought leaders also had plenty to say about increased competition among DSPs themselves, as well as SSPs’ efforts to beat the perception that they’ve become commodified and interchangeable. And supply-path optimization (SPO) and competition in the middle of the programmatic marketplace were front and center for AdExchanger’s guest contributors. Of course, the hottest topic across all industries – generative AI – drove a ton of thoughtful chatter from contributors, with advertisers attempting to separate the hype from reality. And some evergreen industry obsessions – like brand safety, media quality and the need to prove outcomes from ad campaigns – remained top of mind. Here’s our rundown of the top 10 most popular guest columns of 2025 and why they resonated. 1. The Trade Desk’s Blue Ocean Moment: How The DSP Can Rewrite Ad Tech’s Rules By Danilo Tauro, Aperiam Ventures While The Trade Desk made news with its tough stance on SSPs, its efforts to remain competitive with its Big Tech rivals Google, Amazon and Meta also attracted a ton of industry attention. Wall Street, in particular, seemed dissatisfied with TTD’s lack of urgency in the face of growing competition from Amazon DSP, resulting in TTD’s stock price trending downward this year. TTD is missing its true blue ocean opportunity to compete with the walled gardens, Tauro wrote. Instead of chasing CTV inventory or data, which are the specialties of platforms like Google and Amazon, he advised TTD to double down on what Big Tech can’t: independence and accountability. 2. SSPs Are Facing Extinction – And Only Bold Differentiation Can Save Them By Scott Young, Transmit Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. The hard truth behind The Trade Desk branding all SSPs as resellers that need to be cut from the supply chain? Many in the industry agreed. The perception that SSPs are interchangeable and, therefore, expendable, was caused by their efforts to be platform-agnostic, argued Young. He advised SSPs to differentiate themselves by focusing on their original value proposition: increasing publishers’ ad revenue yield. 3. The Death Of The DSP? How Ad Tech’s Cash Flow Crisis Threatens The Entire Ecosystem By Chris Pettit, Revving Microsoft shutting down its DSP (formerly known as Xandr and AppNexus) in May proved that competition isn’t just getting tougher among SSPs. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s move brought back bad memories of unpaid debts caused by the demise of MediaMath, another once-ascendent DSP, back in 2023. When DSPs go out of business, the entire supply chain has to deal with the repercussions. So, publishers, SSPs and other industry stakeholders should prioritize liquidity on their own terms, Pettit wrote. It’s a pretty convenient argument coming from the CEO of a cash-flow management company. But Pettit shed light on a fundamental weakness baked into the programmatic supply chain – one that’s clearly a cause for concern among industry experts. 4. Marketing To Machines: A New Performance Strategy In The Age Of AI Agents By Michael Lehman, Nativo Consumers just don’t click links like they used to. And publishers – and brands alike – have had to adjust to shifting content discovery habits. Simply put, the old SEO playbook is obsolete, argued Lehman. Generative engine optimization (GEO) is the new SEO. And brands that want exposure in search results need to ensure they’re top of mind for AI chatbots. 5. Goodbye, Outcomes Era: Why Quality Will Define The Industry’s Future By Erez Levin, Emet Advisory As we entered 2025, much of the ad industry conversation centered on the idea that digital advertising was firmly in its “Outcomes Era.” Marketers had become laser focused on proving that campaigns produced concrete results, rather than chasing vanity ad tech metrics like viewability. But marketers’ obsession with outcomes is nothing new, Levin wrote, and it’s exactly what led them to chase vanity metrics in the first place. Plus, this fixation on performance has encouraged all kinds of attribution shenanigans, with powerful advertising platforms claiming credit for conversions even if their impact on the consumer’s decision was hard to prove. According to Levin, the better path forward for the industry is to focus on high-quality media and forging close partnerships with premium publishers that command the trust of their audiences. 6. Why Meta’s Exit From MRC Audits Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Marketers By Nicole Scaglione, PubMatic Brand safety is a constant concern for marketers and publishers. But it’s perhaps less of a concern for big social media platforms, who are handing content moderation over to automated systems and community feedback while embracing a flood of AI slop. Meta made social media’s priorities clear in October when it withdrew from the Media Ratings Council’s brand safety audits altogether. These trends should cause marketers to reconsider their commitments to social video, argued PubMatic’s resident video expert – especially as programmatic CTV opens up more premium, brand-safe options. 7. The Brand Safety Myth: Why Most Marketers Don’t Need Brand Safety Verification By Michal Fuchs, Zoomd Speaking of brand safety, maybe marketers don’t need brand safety verification for every campaign use case. Relying on verification vendors for avoiding invalid traffic and outright fraud remains important, argued Fuchs. But most advertisers don’t need to verify every single ad impression as brand safe, and doing so is probably causing more harm than good. 8. AI Is Everywhere, But Where Is It Really Adding Value? By Angelina Eng, IAB The ad industry has a tendency to rush into adopting shiny new technologies, argued Eng. That tendency is a huge risk when it comes to much-hyped but still disproven AI applications. To avoid making the same mistake with generative and agentic AI, Eng offered advice for how advertisers can test these emerging technologies with discipline and an emphasis on clear business objectives. 9. The 7 Traits Every Ad Tech Leader Needs To Thrive In The Age Of AI By Ann Blinkhorn, Blinkhorn LLC and Randall Rothenberg, Randall, Ltd. Winning in advertising’s AI era will require leadership to develop entirely new skill sets. Two ad tech OGs with plenty of experience mentoring industry executives polled some of the top minds in digital advertising to see which traits they think will distinguish the next generation of leaders. 10. Closing The CTV Outcome Data Gap: Unlocking Smarter Optimization Strategies By Cintia Gabilan, IAB While plenty of big-picture topics dominated industry discussion this year, the nuts and bolts of running ad campaigns and measuring outcomes remained just as important as ever. CTV is digital advertising’s hottest media channel, but it’s also one of the more inscrutable ones when it comes to measuring campaign performance. In this column, Gabilan detailed the difficulties industry groups face in creating a standardized conversion API for CTV – but why developing one is essential for the future of campaign measurement.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.) Allee Errico’s pages in Bernadette #2 9.) Pleasure Beach #1 by Josh Pettinger 8.) Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan 7.) Flea by Mara Ramirez 6.) Christine by Cyril Vilks 5.) Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics. You and Me on Repeat by Mary Shyne, published by Henry Holt. The Horrors of Being a Human by Desmond Reed, published by Microcosm Publishing. Tuck Everlasting: The Graphic Novel by K. Woodman-Maynard, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This Beautiful Ridiculous City by Kay Sohini, published by Ten Speed Press. Raised by Ghosts by Briana Loewinsohn, published by Fantagraphics. Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb, published by Fantagraphics. Raymond Chandler’s Trouble is My Business by Arvind Ethan David & Ilias Kyriazis, published by Pantheon. The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing. Best Digital Comic — C’mon: it’s the 21st century and this category is totally irrelevant.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Title: The €170bn 'resting' in Irish bank accounts

Try from €1.50 / week Try from €1.50 / week €1 in every €7 earned in Ireland is now being saved by households, underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. Irish households are saving money at a rate not seen since the pandemic-induced highs of the early 2020s with recent data showing the savings rate hitting the highest levels since the middle of 2022. However, much of that money languishes in deposit accounts which offer little in the way of returns for customers as inflation erodes its value. Recently released figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that Irish households are continuing to add to their deposit accounts with the savings rate rising to almost 15% between July and September, up 2% from the previous quarter. The current savings rate is also notably above the average of 13.1% since the beginning of 2023. It said that €1 in €7 is now being saved by households, which is being underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. According to data from the Central Bank of Ireland, as of the end of October, the total value of household deposits stood at €170.3bn marking the first time in the history of the data series that this figure surpassed €170bn - an increase of €2bn compared to September and an increase of €11.3bn in the year to the end of October. Even though all categories had a positive contribution, overnight deposits - which is money largely kept in current accounts - was the main driver, reporting a positive flow of €1.9bn during the month. The CSO said that savings can add to a household's overall wealth in the form of buying new homes, growing bank deposits, pension savings, and paying off debt. Managing director of Cork-based financial planning firm Alpha Wealth Nick Charalambous said the reality is a lot of Irish depositors are “getting next to zero interest” on their savings with inflation eroding its value over time. "Don't leave your money sitting dormant in the banks, the post office, credit unions,” he said. Financial planner with Castle Capital Colum Carroll said inflation is the “real killer” of wealth and investing money, whether it be through a pension or other mechanisms, allows people to plan better for the future. "People often see investments as being risky, but I think the narrative kind of needs to change around that again…Not investing can actually be even more risky. The risk of running out of money, the risk of not having enough money in the future, or losing purchasing power. They're the kind of real risks,” he said. Mr Charalambous said a part of the reason for people keeping money on deposit or in savings is the fear of losing it and maybe a lack of understanding of the options that are out there for people to make their money work harder particularly over the medium to long term. When looking into what to do with all their savings, Mr Charalambous said households should consider the timeframe for when they need the savings as this will dictate the appropriate financial vehicle. In the short-term, which would be three years or less, he says that money should be kept on deposit. "Most of us are now used to using Revolut. With their introduction of savings and deposit rates as well as investment accounts, there are millions upon millions of euros going into those types of savings,” he said, however, there are better returns offered by other non-Irish entities. “Raisin would be my preferred one, and the main reason for that is that they use physical banks. With Raisin you can get a sort of a three month starter rate with Raisin themselves who are triple a rated institution at 3.1% gross, and typically the demand deposit rates with Raisin are in and around 2.15%,” he said. After covering expenses and managing savings for the short-term, Mr Charalambous said people should be prioritising longer-term investments such as a pension. "Unfortunately, we all live in the here and now, and it's very difficult for us to kind of visualize a scenario where we are basically benefiting from building up this very tax efficient investment vehicle, which is a pension,” he said. In the medium term, which would be four years or longer, Mr Charalambous said there are investment options from the likes of Irish Life, Aviva, and Zurich which offer “very broad investment solutions”. Mr Charalambous said all investments should be reviewed at least once a year. Given the growth of Revolut, along with other financial applications, people have become a lot more familiar with investing themselves in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In these apps, people can choose to manage their own investments with the money being easily accessible should the customer need to make a withdrawal. However, Mr Charalambous warned that the options often offered in these apps are very concentrated and largely dependent on US stock markets. "The Vanguard S&P 500 as an example, is the most common ETF globally, where most people start with and put too much exposure to. But it's a very narrow fund, because it's concentrated purely in the US, solely in 500 companies,” he said, adding that it is largely dependent on the growth of the Magnificent Seven. “Yet we've seen gold has done spectacularly well this year. European equities have typically outperformed the US particularly if you take into account the dollar weakness that we've seen this year.” Growth in the US stock market is heavily concentrated on just a handful of companies nicknamed the Magnificent Seven - Google’s parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - which brings with it a lot of risk particularly if there is a falloff in the tech sector. Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, has seen its stock price surge over the course of the year as tech companies scramble to buy as many of its graphics processing units (GPUs) as possible to put into data centres to power their AI models. Nvidia alone accounts for over 7% of the S&P 500. Mr Charalambous said the Vanguard S&P 500 is a “speculative type of investing” and the risk might be higher than they realise. "People typically wouldn't realize the level of risk that they may be undertaking when they go into a fund like that,” he said. Data from the Central Bank of Ireland shows the market value of Irish resident holdings of securities stood at just under €6 trillion (tn) as of the end of September - an increase of €353m over the quarter. Of this total, Irish pension funds account for €51bn while household investments account for €28.26bn. Listed shares accounted for €2.4tn of the total with the US being the primary destination for Irish resident investment in stocks accounting for 58% of the total value or €1.4tn. In comparison, the Irish stock market only accounts for 2% or €49bn, of the total money Irish investment in stocks. The surge in share valuations in the US stock market is primarily being driven by the Magnificent Seven of which many are heavily investing in AI and its supporting infrastructure, particularly data centres. However, as of yet, there has been little return on this investment for these companies and if the so-called AI bubble bursts, this could spell trouble for Irish investors who have a lot of money wrapped up in US stocks. In terms of households holdings of listed shares, it reached an all-time high during the third quarter reaching €11.5bn. However, this is largely due to the increase in the overall total market value which increased by around €700m in the quarter. During the budget in October, former finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced a reduction in the investment exit tax from 41% to 38% from January 1 which makes it a little cheaper to actually invest in ETFs or other investment products. This rate could come down in the future potentially reaching the 33% rate set for capital gains tax. Due to these tax changes, Mr Carroll said coming into 2026 it’s now “more advantageous” to invest than it has been over the last number of years because of the exit tax coming down. “Hopefully that should come down even more,” he said, adding that even if it came down to 33% it would still be quite high compared to the US and the UK. Capital gains tax is paid at 33% on the profits of the sale or disposal of certain access such as shares in a company or bonds. However, an exit tax is paid on the profit from an investment in a fund - such as an ETF - and is charged at 38%. In addition, under deemed disposal rules, that tax is liable to be paid every eight years regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. Given the lower rate of tax on holding single shares, rather than investing in broad funds, Mr Carroll said these rules do not "promote good investing”. “You get 33% if you hold a single stock which is very risky, versus holding a tiny, tiny percentage of tens of thousands of stocks all around the world, you get taxed heavily on that,” he said. "The best practice is, if you have the money now and you don't need access to it, now is the best time to invest,” he said. "Like long term investing isn't essentially risky, it's more the risk of not having enough money in the future or when you need it. If you don't have enough money to pay for your children's education fund, or you don't have enough money to retire at 65 and you need to continue to work longer than you'd hoped, that's the kind of real risk,” Mr Carroll said.

Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?

Time Published: 2025-12-26T21:45:00Z
Full Content:
On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this. MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and NVIDIA wasn't on the list.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © nextheprime / Shutterstock.com Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) certainly stands out as one of the bigger “deals” to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year. Whether that’s due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market. Since it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with. At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can’t yet see? In such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut. Notably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend. Another bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends. I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as “lagging” in the AI race. Undoubtedly, there’s room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it’s just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that’s why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year. At the time of this writing, Meta Platforms’ shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, thanks in part to the nasty decline the stock encountered back in October. Our top personal finance-related articles today.
