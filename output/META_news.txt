Title: TJX Wins Without An RMN; Unlearning To Crawl
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/tuesday-25112025/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T05:01:54Z
Full Content:
The X Factor Big-box department and clothing stores are getting hammered. So why is TJX, the parent company of discount chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, crushing it right now? That’s a question recently mulled by Bloomberg writer Amanda Mull. For one, TJX has a few fortuitous tailwinds. Manufacturers over-acquired raw goods earlier this year to stock up for tariff-related price increases. That’s ideal for TJX, which buys products cheaply when other companies overproduce. But, also, TJX is not a retail media player whatsoever and cares way more about in-store sales than it does about ecommerce. In-person is simply a more exciting shopping experience, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. And that, he said, is something the competition lacks, excitement. Consumers are therefore “very open to trying us,” Herrman said. Other retailers have reshaped their store footprint around ecommerce warehousing and buy-online, pick-up-in-store fulfillment. Stores, in turn, become less appealing, sometimes as a direct result of retail media. Who remembers the Walgreens-Cooler-Screens fiasco? Don’t Crawl On Me Two roads diverged in a yellow wood: One leads to a partnership with OpenAI, the other to blocking OpenAI’s bots. In contrast to Walmart’s headfirst dive into agentic shopping, Amazon recently updated its robots.txt file to block more OpenAI bots from crawling its site, Modern Retail reports. ChatGPT has been providing more referral traffic for some retailers, like Walmart and Target, but Amazon prefers shoppers to purchase from it directly, rather than via ChatGPT. A primary incentive? Ads, of course. Amazon’s advertising business generates roughly $56 billion a year, according to Modern Retail, and depends on shoppers browsing its site. (People can bypass ads when they’re shopping via ChatGPT.) And so, for now, Amazon has been leaning into its own agentic shopping tools instead. Still, Amazon hasn’t fully ruled out future partnerships with third-party agents. During the company’s most recent earnings call in late October, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to “find ways to partner” with these companies in the future. Bipartisan Haterade You know you’ve messed up as a company when politicians are reaching across the aisle to try and figure out what your problem is. Sens. Josh Hawley (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D) have asked the FTC and SEC to investigate Meta’s reportedly fraud-filled ad ecosystem, according to The Guardian. In a joint letter, the senators cited recent reporting by Reuters that Meta is involved in one-third of all scams in the US and made $16 billion (or 10% of its overall revenue) from fraudulent and scam ads in 2024. This isn’t the first time Hawley and Blumenthal have teamed up against Meta. In April, they announced an investigation into Meta’s alleged collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party to build censorship tools. And, last month, they introduced a bill to Congress that would require AI chatbot companies to enforce stricter age verification measures. Basically, any time Meta makes headlines for something egregious, expect these guys to respond with world-class hater energy. Speaking of which, a newly released legal brief suggests that, in 2019, Meta halted internal research when findings suggested that people who stop using Facebook report feeling less depressed. It should be fun to see what the senators make of that. But Wait! There’s More! Foreign content creators are making bank off America’s polarized political climate.

Title: Best Buy Has New Low Prices On Amiibo - Zelda, Street Fighter, And More

By Brendan Hesse and Jon Bitner on November 24, 2025 at 11:06AM PST GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Best Buy's Black Friday sale kicked off last week, bringing some massive deals to Nintendo games, hardware, and accessories--but some of the best deals are for Amiibo figures. The retailer has big deals on select figures, and has even restocked a several older releases. Some of the best savings are for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo, which are steeply discounted to just $10 each (normally $30). Similarly, the recently released Street Fighter 6 Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly Switch 2 Amiibo figures are all 50% off at $15 (normally $30). Best Buy also has several hard-to-find characters in stock at their original $16 MSRP--undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections, as well as preorders for upcoming figures like the Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo. Below is a list of all Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: $10 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $10 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $10 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle is retiring soon, but you can get this $65 Lego Mario set for $28 in Amazon's Black Friday sale. By Steven Petite on November 23, 2025 at 5:55PM PST Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon Update: This deal is no longer available. For the second week in a row, Amazon is selling a Lego Super Mario playset for over 50% off during its Black Friday sale. Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set. Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT. Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50). The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: AI Data Center Overinvestment Debate Intensifies
URL: https://newsonjapan.com/article/147701.php
Time Published: 2025-11-23T20:35:47Z
Full Content:
TOKYO, Nov 24 (News On Japan) - A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure. Amazon followed with multi-trillion-yen bond issuance of its own, accelerating investor unease that Big Tech may be committing to expansion on a scale that will be difficult to recover through future earnings. Analysts note that similar alarms were raised in the spring, when Microsoft’s rapid increase in data-center investment briefly pushed its share price downward. Although Microsoft later demonstrated stronger-than-expected cloud profitability, restoring the stock’s momentum, recent market reactions suggest that investors are once again sensitive to the possibility of overcapacity. At the center of the market’s short-term anxiety is Nvidia, whose earnings announcement was scheduled for release on the evening of November 6th U.S. time. Although Nvidia is the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization and its quarterly results draw global attention, industry specialists argue that Nvidia itself is not responsible for the potential overinvestment problem. Because the company does not build data centers—supplying only the semiconductors used within them—its exposure to investment risk remains limited. The current concerns, they say, relate primarily to the companies constructing the facilities, not the device manufacturers responding to orders. Capital-expenditure forecasts compiled by market analysts illustrate the divide: Apple and Nvidia appear at the bottom in terms of anticipated outlays, while Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle show steep upward investment trajectories. Apple, in particular, has deliberately avoided the data-center arms race, choosing instead to rely on hybrid models using external AI infrastructure rather than directly competing in facility construction. Oracle, buoyed by demand from OpenAI, has recently accelerated its investment pace. Meta’s stock has come under especially heavy selling pressure, with the company falling nearly 10 percent following its bond-issuance announcement. Market participants attribute this reaction to two factors: first, CEO Zuckerberg’s remark that it remains uncertain whether the investment will translate directly into profit growth, but that “not investing now would be the greater risk.” Analysts viewed the statement as an inversion of normal capital-expenditure logic, prompting concerns about strategic discipline. Second, investors remain wary after Meta’s earlier push into the metaverse failed to gain traction despite major financial commitments and a corporate name change. Even so, some specialists argue that technologies dismissed as premature—such as AI a decade ago—can surge once the right market environment arrives. The long history of metaverse-like platforms, including the rise and collapse of virtual worlds such as Second Life in the mid-2000s, is often cited as evidence that cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation repeat until demand eventually aligns. For now, however, the data-center overinvestment question dominates market sentiment. Investors are watching whether the massive spending undertaken by major U.S. platforms can be justified by future profits—or whether companies like Apple, which has largely stayed out of the infrastructure race, will ultimately be rewarded for their restraint. The outcome, analysts say, will shape the competitive landscape over the next one to two years and could significantly influence the direction of global AI development. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure.

Source: テレ東BIZ A powerful earthquake struck the Aso region of Kumamoto at around 6:01 p.m. on November 25th, toppling a residential gate in Aso City and scattering roof tiles across the road, while rockfalls and damage were reported in nearby areas. A Ferris wheel at the Expocity commercial complex in Suita, Osaka, known as the tallest in Japan at 123 meters, came to an abrupt stop on November 25th after a lightning strike disabled its operating system, leaving 20 passengers trapped in nine gondolas until the early hours of the following morning. A large-scale water outage continued across parts of Okinawa on November 25th after a damaged pipeline caused significant leakage the previous day, with local authorities reporting ongoing disruptions as of 11:35 a.m. Yellow dust is forecast to reach Fukuoka from the morning of November 25th through November 26th, prompting the city to urge residents—particularly those with respiratory or allergy-related conditions—to take precautions such as wearing masks when going outdoors. A large fire that broke out late on November 23rd at a waste plastic recycling plant in the city of Bando in Ibaraki has continued to burn for roughly 18 hours, with no clear timeline for containment. The blaze was first reported at around 10:40 p.m. on November 23rd when nearby residents alerted firefighters after seeing flames and smoke rising from the site. Nvidia maintains an estimated 80% share of the global AI chip market, but a surge of new competitors is beginning to challenge the company’s dominance, reshaping expectations across the semiconductor industry. Japan is often perceived internationally as adopting Al cautiously rather than rapidly. Yet 2025 is starting to show a different reality. Japan's digital currency sector has transformed from a Wild West frontier into one of the most carefully monitored markets in the world. A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. A dramatic shift is beginning to unfold in software development as AI transforms programming into an everyday skill that no longer requires specialist expertise, a trend highlighted in a forthcoming set of 2026 technology forecasts compiled by Nikkei BP. Generative AI continues to evolve at astonishing speed, raising both expectations and concerns about a future in which machine intelligence surpasses human capability, and according to Shota Imai, a 31-year-old visiting professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology who is emerging as one of the country’s leading young AI researchers, the question now is how closely AI’s value systems can be aligned with those of humans, as breakthroughs since the arrival of ChatGPT push society into uncharted territory. ここ数年、日本企業では多くの大きな変化が起きています。その中でも特に注目されているのが AI OCR の活用です。 Apple’s position in the global race for artificial intelligence is increasingly in focus as questions continue to surface over whether the company has fallen behind Google and Microsoft, and how it compares with Nvidia, now one of the world’s most powerful semiconductor makers. © 2025 News On Japan.

🛍️ The 52 best Walmart Black Friday deals to shop right now (updating) 🛍️ By Heather Kuldell-Ware Published Nov 23, 2025 8:55 AM EST We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more › Sign Up For Goods 🛍️ Product news, reviews, and must-have deals. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a rough stretch for many budgets, thanks to tariffs and rising grocery bills. If you stashed money this year in a Flexible Spending Account (aka a Flexible Spending Arrangement) and managed to dodge major medical expenses, now’s the time to put those hard-earned, pre-tax dollars to work for you and stock up for 2026 before your plan’s deadline. While FSAs are best known for covering copays and over-the-counter basics—like anti-inflammatories and cold & flu meds, first-aid and emergency kits, and vision and eye-care—you may also be able to put that balance toward high-tech health wearables, mobility and recovery gear, or even certain specialty mattresses and e-bike setups with a doctor’s note. And there’s no legal reason you can’t take advantage of that FSA and a discount shopping holiday like Black Friday/Cyber Monday simultaneously, so scroll those sales ASAP! You’ve already used the funds to lower this year’s tax liability; now let them enhance next year’s life. A health FSA is an employer-sponsored benefit that lets you set aside part of each paycheck—up to $3,300 for 2025—into an account for out-of-pocket medical costs. You decide whether to opt in when you start a job or during annual open enrollment or other qualifying life events, and then determine how much to contribute from each paycheck. Think of it as a single-year health nest egg you can use for deductibles, copayments, prescriptions, and a range of eligible medical expenses. Traditionally, you submit a claim to your FSA administrator with proof of what you bought and confirmation that insurance didn’t cover it. Many plans now offer a debit card you can swipe like a checking account, but it’s still smart to save your receipts in case your plan—or the IRS—asks for documentation later. An FSA can be a powerful budgeting tool for people with predictable, recurring medical costs, such as a payment plan for braces, monthly insulin refills, or a new annual supply of contact lenses. But if your FSA is more of a “just in case” cushion, it’s easy to reach the end of the year with a surprising amount of money sitting there—and a countdown to spend it. Unlike Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), FSAs require you to spend your balance by December 31 or you forfeit the funds. Some employers offer a small rollover—up to $660—or a grace period of an extra month or two to use the remaining funds. For your plan’s exact rules, check with your employer. What’s covered by FSA reimbursement is determined by the IRS and must be a “qualified medical expense.” In the IRS docs, that’s defined as “costs related to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or expenses that affect the structure or function of the body.” First-aid supplies and over-the-counter meds may come to mind first, but it can also include things like: Your FSA provider is ultimately the referee here. If you’re hoping to get reimbursed for something that isn’t clearly listed as an eligible expense, you may need a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)—essentially a note from your doctor explaining why you need it for a specific condition. With an LMN, some plans will cover things like vitamins, exercise equipment or fitness trackers, specialty pillows or mattresses, and even massage guns, as long as they’re prescribed to treat a documented medical issue and your plan signs off. It’s easy to find FSA-eligible items online; many vendors clearly label FSA and HSA items, and large retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and CVS have dedicated portals. Supergoop! This staff favorite is one of the few sunscreens that some of us will put on our faces. It goes on invisible—no smeary white to rub in—and is virtually weightless. How does a liquid leave a powdery feel? We’re not sure about the chemistry, but we know it happens. And if you’re outdoorsy, it’s not just important during sunny summer, so it’s a perfect Add to Cart. Banana Boat Need a bigger bottle to smear on the kids? This family size provides SPF 50 protection that resists sweat and water. But remember: You’re supposed to put a shot glass’s worth of sunscreen on each time you head out in the rays. OMRON Blood pressure probably isn’t top of mind unless you know yours is too high or too low. Having a reliable monitor at home provides a convenient way to check your blood pressure more often than random clinical visits, which can help spot sudden changes or changing trends. Versions with arm cuffs, like this Omron Platinum model, tend to be more accurate than the wrist-worn kind. This model stores up to 100 readings for two users and syncs with the OMRON connect app to easily share reports with your doctor. Dexcom Part of the promise of tech-infused health care is more personalized care. The cost of devices like at-home glucose monitors has come down enough that people can now see how different foods, workouts, and even sleep affect their blood sugar in real time. This particular device was created for people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin, those with prediabetes, and health-conscious adults. Johnson & Johnson This compact first-aid kit is small and inexpensive enough to stash anywhere you tend to do everyday damage and suddenly need a bandage. Inside are 80 pieces of essential care—hand-cleaning wipes, extra-strength Tylenol, gauze, Neosporin, and more—all in a package that fits easily in a glove box, desk drawer, or carry-on bag. FriCARE We stash these self-adhesive rolls of tape in all sorts of places: first-aid kits, sports bags, most notably. They’re latex-free, great for sprains or just holding gauze or large bandages in place without using the kind of tape that feels like it’s going to rip your skin off when you remove it. It’s even useful for furry family members (animal or human). Biotrue Contact solutions do expire, but regular users often find they fly through these 10-ounce bottles faster than they expect. This two-pack of multipurpose cleaner also comes with a new contact case to replace your crusty one. ThinOptics We know two things about readers: either you refuse to wear them, or you own a pair that’s never where you actually need it. ThinOptics solves that with ultra-slim specs that tuck into a case and attach to the back of your phone. They’re armless, resting on your nose like an old-timey pince-nez, and come in standard 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 magnifications. iHealth Is the coughing and sneezing some dust or something bigger? Stock up on these rapid 15-minute tests to get your first indications whether you have flu or COVID, and then plan out your next steps. Clearblue Preggers? Not preggers? Whichever outcome you want, this early-detection test finds even low concentrations of the pregnancy hormone and features a wide tip for, uh, easier collection. Some of the more surprising gadgets and big-ticket buys aren’t “swipe your FSA card and walk away” purchases; they usually require you to pay in full and do a little extra after checkout. But if you’re not afraid of some paperwork, some cool splurges can help you improve your health. For many, brands partner with a program like Truemed, which has you fill out a health survey after purchase so a licensed provider can review your situation and, if you qualify, issue a Letter of Medical Necessity. Then you simply submit the letter plus your receipt (sometimes only for the amount above a “basic” version), and your FSA administrator processes repayment. Here are just a few examples of tech you might have thought was cool, but could also be FSA reimbursable (confirm with your insurance/doctor before any major purchase). Ray-Ban Glasses are one of the most fun (or at least most functional) ways to burn through FSA funds—and if you wear prescription lenses, that can even include Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, aka AI glasses in disguise. They correct your vision and let you whisper questions to Meta AI (“What’s the currency conversion?” “Where’s the nearest coffee?”) while casually snapping photos and videos without doing the full phone-fumble. (This is a joy we’ve experienced first-hand on rocky ridges with the dog, where you need all your hands free but still want a picture of your furry friend against the horizon.) They’re also a great way to escape the tyranny of noise-canceling headphones: tiny speakers and mics aim sound at your ears so you can play music, get reminders, and still hear the real world happening around you. Plus, upcoming software updates will likely expand the capabilities, including their use as hearables (though there are already dedicated Nuance Audio hearing frames you can purchase as an FSA-eligible prescription pair if you’re more concerned with what’s audible than what’s AI). There are other Meta models that qualify. But no matter what frame shape you select, we also highly recommend getting Transitions lenses, so they pull seamless double duty as both your everyday specs with blue light filters and your stylish sunnies. One caveat: super-strong prescriptions (the kind that usually require high-index lenses) may not work in Meta Ray-Bans due to the delicate electronics, which could be damaged by the pressure required to insert the optics. Oura A discreet, screenless health tracker, the Oura Ring 4 goes far beyond sleep. It automatically tracks activity, blood oxygen, heart and respiratory rate, and skin temperature changes, then turns those metrics into clear, behavior-focused guidance in the app. You can even log personal factors—like caffeine intake or alcohol consumption—to see what’s affecting your rest. It’s ideal for people who care more about health insights than hardcore fitness training stats, and who want something smaller and subtler than a smartwatch. To unlock the full features of the ring, a membership is also required. Other wearables—Garmin smartwatches, for example—can qualify for reimbursement with a post-purchase Truemed assessment and approval. While select sleep and heart-rate monitors (and smart scales) don’t even require that. Ride1Up Exercise is a huge part of staying healthy—and yes, some e-bikes can qualify for FSA spending. We’re talking Class 1 e-bikes only: operable pedals, no throttle, and a max assist speed of 20 mph to make sure you get some sort of workout.At Ride1Up, for example, you can choose from the road-ready CF Racer1 (pictured above), the off-road TrailRush, or the commuter-friendly Prodigy v2. After checkout, Ride1Up will send you a quick Truemed health survey, and if you’re approved, you’ll get the Letter of Medical Necessity you need to submit your purchase for FSA reimbursement. If there’s another ebike brand you’ve been eyeing, it’s worth checking their site. Purple Much like e-bikes, mattresses usually require a Letter of Medical Necessity, and not every model qualifies. You need features that go beyond a basic bed—pressure relief, targeted support, cooling layers, or designs that help with pain or sleep issues—which means going beyond a basic bed’s price. For example, Purple’s RestorePlus Hybrid (pictured above) fits the bill with three inches of GelFlex Grid that contours to your body, supports your lower back, and sleeps cooler than traditional materials. Funds will come in handy when purchasing a multithousand-dollar mattress, but as owners of a Purple RejuvenatePremier (as well as a lumbar back cushion for long-haul flights), we can vouch for the namesake material’s relief return on investment. Keep in mind that often only part of the mattress is eligible for reimbursement—usually the amount that exceeds the price of a basic mattress. After purchase, Purple partners with Truemed, which sends a quick medical survey plus simple instructions for submitting that eligible portion to your HSA/FSA administrator. Other mattress manufacturers may have similar setups. Chirp Chronic pain sufferers might be interested in the Halo, a $199.99 device that combines TENS and EMS technologies to deliver electrical pulses that both block pain signals and increase blood flow to sore areas. The charging case holds two Halo pucks, a rechargeable remote, extension cables, and a set of reusable magnetic pads. Not sure where to place the pads? The companion app shows you exactly where to apply them based on your pain points. You can choose from six preset programs and still adjust the intensity and duration to your comfort level. Purchases through the Chirp website can be made with FSA/HSA cards, though the company notes you may need additional documentation for reimbursement. Theragun There are massage guns and then there are Theraguns. The $649.99 PRO Plus doesn’t just hammer whatever hurts; the app gives you smart, guided routines so you’re treating the right muscles (often the ones around the sore spot). When you connect a Garmin, Apple Watch, Strava, or Google Fit, it pulls in your activity to build personalized recovery plans based on your goals, actual workouts, and current science. Hardware-wise, it’s fully loaded: hot attachments for soothing warmth, built-in LED light therapy (a miniaturized panel like those skin tone/texture therapy Glo masks, which are also FSA eligible), plus all the classic heads—standard ball, dampener, thumb, wedge, and micro-point. If you want to go full hot-and-cold recovery geek, you can even add a separate cold attachment. It’s basically a high-end recovery studio. Before your deadline hits, run through this quick list to make sure you’re getting the most out of your FSA balance: 2025 Holiday Gift Guide By Andrew Coletti By Andrew Paul By Heather Kuldell-Ware By Fiona Tapp By Terry Sullivan By Carsen Joenk By Terry Sullivan By Jen McCaffery By Vinny Panza By Abby Ferguson By Tony Ware By Heather Kuldell-Ware By Terri Williams By Stack Commerce By Brandt Ranj By Nick Hilden By Fiona Tapp By Stan Horaczek Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

If you're searching for elusive Amiibo this holiday season, consider taking a peek at Best Buy during its Black Friday Sale event. The retailer currently has Amiibo in stock that are sold out at most other locations--including several that have been out of print for years. Many of these are available for their original $16 MSRP, undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including the recently released Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures. You can also pick up the Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. You can also grab The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo for $20 each, down from their usual $30. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock right now, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections. Below you'll find a list of all of the Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy $20 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $20 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $20 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 If the Kirby Air Riders series feels a bit too expensive, you can instead check out this old Amiibo from 2016. Featuring Kirby traveling on a Warp Star, it's just $16 at Best Buy right now. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Equity investors are growing increasingly concerned about the amount of leverage that Big Tech is taking on to build out its artificial intelligence infrastructure as the industry faces rising fears of a bubble. The enormous sums major technology companies are spending on AI are nothing new, but the record pile of debt they’re raising to do it is. What’s worrying stock traders is the trend represents a break from recent history, when companies tapped their huge cash piles to pay for their capital expenditures. The use of leverage and the circular nature of many of the financing deals introduces a level of risk that wasn’t there before.

Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-going-on-with-oracle-its-stock-price-has-dropped-more-than-40-percent-in-two-months-11854719
Time Published: 2025-11-21T21:20:13Z
Full Content:
Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Title: Why Nvidia’s Enduring Momentum Isn’t Easing A.I. Bubble Concerns

What a difference a day can make. Nvidia shares surged on Wednesday after the chip giant reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance, defying growing talk of an A.I. bubble and high-profile exits from investors like Peter Thiel. But just 24 hours later, Wall Street’s A.I. darling nosedived more than 3 percent yesterday (Nov. 20) as hopes for another interest rate cut this year faded following a hotter-than-expected September jobs report. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Those renewed rate concerns, combined with lingering fears that A.I. stocks are dangerously overpriced, triggered a sharp market reversal. The Dow erased a 700-point gain to finish down 386 points yesterday, while the Nasdaq fell 486 points and the S&P 500 dropped 103. Nvidia reported total revenue of $57 billion for the August-October quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of $55 billion, with EPS of $1.30 versus the predicted $1.26. The company predicted that sales for the current quarter ending January should reach about $65 billion, above Wall Street’s consensus of $61.7 billion. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives praised the results, arguing they show the A.I. boom remains solid. He pointed to Nvidia’s $2 billion data-center revenue beat and strong demand for its upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chips. He reiterated his view that the A.I. build-out is still in its early stages, with tech giants—or “hyperscalers” such as Google, Meta and Microsoft—expected to spend between $550 billion and $600 billion next year to accelerate A.I. adoption. “The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision show the A.I. Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead it’s Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Ives said in a client note this week. Still, after Thiel sold his $100 million stake in Nvidia—joining other major sellers like SoftBank, which recently unwound $5.8 billion—some investors began to wonder whether Nvidia and the broader A.I. trade may be approaching a plateau. Concerns over lofty valuations have grown louder, particularly from famed short-seller Michael Burry, who has a $187 million short position against Nvidia. Burry has accused Oracle, Meta, Amazon and Google of understating depreciation for their A.I. infrastructure to inflate earnings through 2028. Joseph Schuster, CEO and founder of ETF operator IPOX Schuster, said recent selling looks more like profit-taking than a sign that an A.I. bubble is ready to burst. “The market is rotating, consolidating and digesting huge gains,” he told Observer, noting that investors are in a “risk-off market” for the rest of the year. “It doesn’t mean that something will burst or fall apart. It’s a normal part of the cycle.” Schuster doesn’t expect a dot-com-style correction and remains optimistic about the A.I.’s long-term fundamentals, but he said Nvidia and other big tech names could see more downside in the weeks ahead. Nvidia, specifically, could slip to the $165–$170 range, he said. Jane Edmondson, head of thematic strategy at ETF research firm VettaFI, agreed. “I have been in bubbles before, and it does seem different this time,” she told Observer. “I do feel like we are still very early days and only just now starting to see [A.I.] use cases that could be groundbreaking.” “If you look at Nvidia’s order books, they are very strong and Huang expects lots of business to come, and I agree with him,” she added. She rejected views that Nvidia’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 30x is unsustainable, saying, “I have never seen companies achieve this level of growth. It’s exponential.” As the market matures, Edmondson said, the winners and losers will become clearer. She expects firms with their own growth capital—such as Google, Meta and Alphabet—to emerge stronger than those that rely heavily on leverage.

Title: Wall Street warns of rising AI debt risk as stocks slide on wobbly investor confidence — analysts warn of 'systemic risk' as Nvidia share price creaks

Increasing systemic risk from interconnected investments with circular revenue relationships is waving red flags. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The honeymoon period for the explosive growth of the AI industry may be drawing to a close, as some of the world's top financial institutions are growing increasingly worried about the sheer quantity of debt being taken on by top tech and AI firms to build out the infrastructure they all claim is so necessary, as Bloomberg reports. Although the top firms continue to perform well, recent wobbles in stock pricing suggest confidence is waning and the risk of a larger collapse grows ever greater. The multiple hundred-billion-dollar deals struck between AI and technology firms in 2025 have raised eyebrows every time the news breaks, but so far, there's only been an upside for the companies involved. OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, Anthropic, and others have all seen their share prices skyrocket in the wake of their interlocking deals, making many of these companies feel like they're buoying each other while they all hunt for the elusive AI profit that has yet to materialize. But those vibes are now turning into genuine concerns in the financing world. "We’ve seen an expansion of the ecosystem to include companies with weaker balance sheets like Oracle and CoreWeave, more debt, and we’ve also seen more interlocking and circular revenue relationships,” said Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer for wealth management. “That interconnectivity between the players brings systemic risk.” Although Nvidia has made real money with everyone buying up its graphics cards to power the new AI data centers, most other companies in the space have yet to realize anything in the way of profit. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Google can at least rely on strong profits in their existing businesses, but many companion companies, like the aforementioned Coreweave, do not. Oracle is another example. Though it had a strong business in place already, it's certainly not hundreds of billions strong. But that's now what it's being tasked to deliver, and despite the interlocked deals with these other "hyperscaler" businesses, that may not be enough to maintain investor confidence forever. To manage these investments, it's been forced to take on more debt, with Bloomberg reporting Oracle selling $18 billion in government bonds in September, and banks lending it $38 billion for further capital expenditure. Since its record share price highs in September, it's now fallen by over a third. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Indeed, even the venerable Nvidia isn't invulnerable to the shake in confidence. Nvidia's recent earnings reports were strong, but its stock price has slid several percent in recent days and has lost over 10 percent since the start of the month. Bloomberg highlights that this reaction from investors comes as they start to hunt for profit in the AI equation. Although capital investment was expected earlier in the AI hype phase, investors are now looking for a return on those investments. That may be where some of the borrowing is coming in: companies look to accelerate their developments to increase revenue over a shorter time scale. “When companies that don’t need to borrow are borrowing to make investments, that sets a bar for the returns on those investments,” explained Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY. “We’re in a ‘show me the money’ phase.” Still, he doesn't see the AI bubble bursting any time soon. Most expenditure is still being funded by cash flow, so investors shouldn't be too concerned for now. As we head into the new year, though, if some of these major investments don't lead to big returns, it's clear investors will put increasing pressure on these AI-first companies to find the profit somewhere.

Title: How AI Is Ushering In A New Nuclear Age
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2025/11/21/how-ai-is-ushering-in-a-new-nuclear-age/
Time Published: 2025-11-21T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByChristopher Helman, Forbes Staff andPhoebe Liu, Forbes Staff. At Aalo Atomics’ 40,000-square-foot factory on the south side of Austin, Texas, workers move five-eighths-inch-thick steel plates onto machines that slowly bend and roll them into 12-foot-wide cylinders, which they then weld into 25-foot-tall vessels. These could be made cheaper by outside contractors. But Aalo cofounder and CEO Matt Loszak wants to do this work in-house, since each vessel will eventually contain the guts of a ten-megawatt (MW) nuclear fission reactor. Five of these Aalo-1 reactor units, working in tandem, will power a single 50 MW electric turbine—enough juice to run a large data-processing center or 45,000 homes. “It’s not a paper reactor; it’s getting built,” declares Loszak, a 35-year-old Canadian engineer now on his third startup. In August, Aalo broke ground on a two-acre site at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, where it aims to achieve “criticality” by July 4, 2026—America’s 250th birthday and the deadline President Donald Trump has set for at least three U.S. startups to prove that their advanced nuclear reactor designs work. To achieve criticality, Aalo will load a vessel with off-the-shelf nuclear fuel rod assemblies and then initiate a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. Producing electricity? That comes later. Even after achieving criticality Aalo will still need to build out manufacturing and a supply chain of vendors, sign data center customers and get final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “We’ll get the factory set up, come down the cost curve and have this Holy Grail product,’’ vows Loszak, who is shopping for up to 1 million square feet for a gigafactory and recently hired Bryson Gentile, who headed Falcon 9 manufacturing at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to set up Aalo’s mass production operation. “What Elon did [with electric cars and rockets] was kind of like running the four-minute mile. When that happens, everyone’s like, ‘Wait, this is possible,’ ” Loszak says. He hopes to produce electricity in 2027. Demand for electricity is soaring, largely because of the power-sucking data centers undergirding the artificial intelligence boom, and Loszak isn’t the only nuclear entrepreneur aiming to ride the wave of AI dollars. A dozen ventures with names like Valar Atomics, Oklo, Kairos Power and X-energy are racing to perfect, permit and deploy a new generation of small, prefabricated reactors that could power individual data centers or even feed the larger electrical grid. So far in 2025, venture capitalists, stock market investors, billionaires, the DOE and others have poured more than $4 billion into these and other new U.S. nuclear ventures, versus closer to $500 million in 2020, per PitchBook. Tens of billions more will be needed if nuclear power is to make a comeback. Two-year-old Aalo has raised $136 million ($100 million of that in August), with billionaire Antonio Gracias’ Valor Equity Partners as its lead backer. Valor was one of Tesla’s first institutional investors, and Gracias, who sits on SpaceX’s board, told Forbes that Aalo will be a winner because of its commitment to manufacturing and vertical integration “similar to Tesla’s first-principles approach to batteries, electric vehicles and robotics.” These startups won’t all succeed. But the stars seem aligned for nuclear energy’s comeback. Demand is there—OpenAI’s Sam Altman has said he’ll need an outlandish 250 gigawatts of power in eight years. (That’s as much as Brazil uses.) More sober analysts predict that by 2030, data centers will need double the roughly 40 GW they now consume. At the current average industrial electricity price of nine cents per kilowatt hour, 40 GW would cost $32 billion a year—but prices will rise if demand grows faster than generating capacity. Analysts see natural gas turbines filling maybe 60% of the need, but those are on four-year back order. Coal remains unpopular (no matter how often Trump refers to the dirtiest fossil fuel as “beautiful and clean”). Wind and solar, besides being on Trump’s hit list, don’t provide the sort of 24/7 reliability data centers require. That’s a big gap for nuclear startups to fill. “There is plenty of room for everyone to do well, because the world needs that much energy and more,’’ says Iran-born billionaire Kamal (Kam) Ghaffarian, the aerospace entrepreneur who is the founder of Rockville, Maryland–based X-energy, which is developing a gas-cooled nuclear reactor. Sure, lots of folks still oppose nuclear reactors, particularly in their own backyard. But support is now both broad-based and top-down. Since reoccupying the Oval Office in January, Trump has canceled giant offshore wind projects, scotched a solar megafarm and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, killing tax credits for wind and solar power projects that begin construction after next July 4. But that same law preserved and expanded benefits for nuclear power—tax credits for new designs now equal up to 40% of investment. The Trump administration is also overhauling the famously slow and cautious Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which should speed up approval of new designs. And it aims to make permitting easier, in part by encouraging startups to locate reactors on military bases or at sites—like the Idaho National Lab—that have hosted nuclear activities since World War II’s Manhattan Project. While Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has been singing nuclear energy’s praises as an answer to global warming for two decades, other voices now join the chorus. People say “ ‘If we invented nuclear fission today, we would view it as the silver bullet that solves climate change,’ ” says Drew Wandzilak, a principal at VC firm Alumni Ventures, which invested in X-energy, Aalo and Valar. “That’s how powerful it is.” Back at Aalo, Loszak and his cofounder, chief technology officer Yasir Arafat, 39, have added personal reasons for pursuing a nuclear revival. Loszak’s childhood asthma abated after his home province, Ontario, replaced nearby coal-burning plants with nuclear ones. Arafat did his calculus homework by candlelight in Bangladesh before coming to the U.S. as a college student and earning a master’s in nuclear engineering from North Carolina State. His career has spanned the scale: He worked on Westinghouse’s big AP1000, an 1,100 MW reactor, before heading to Idaho National Lab in 2019 to lead microreactor design. The cofounders hope eventually to sell their small mass-produced reactors not only to AI firms but also to poor, power-starved countries. Aalo means “the light” in Bengali. Not so long ago, the future of nuclear energy looked grim. After a tsunami led to disaster at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, both Japan and Germany began mothballing sites. The U.S. industry, for its part, had been struggling since the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island in 1979. The accident domina­ted headlines for months, but the small amount of radiation released turned out to pose no threat, the NRC says. Nevertheless, the regulatory fallout from Three Mile Island led to plant cancellations and stricter NRC rules, contributing to delays and runaway costs for big nuclear plants. In 2024, after 15 years, Georgia Power finally completed its Augusta, Georgia, plant with two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, capable of powering 1.7 million houses. The cost surpassed $30 billion, more than double the original budget, reportedly due to unproven engineering, nonexistent supply chains and a skilled-worker shortage. Building a plant of equivalent size with natural gas turbines (assuming they could be found) would cost just $7 billion. It seemed the U.S. no longer had the ability to construct big nuclear plants efficiently. It now has 94 operating grid–scale reactors (many over 40 years old), down from 112 in 1990. DOE, Gates and other true believers were already pouring money into new reactor designs when Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and AI’s voracious power demands jump-started the nuclear bandwagon. The European Union, desperate to wean itself off Russian oil and gas, decided that zero-carbon nuclear power can be considered “green” in some cases. Meta, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google have all inked long-term deals to buy nuke juice. Even Three Mile Island is back in the game. Its surviving reactor, closed in 2019, is now being prepped for restart after Microsoft agreed to buy all its output for the next 20 years. It’s been renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. At 40, Mike Laufer, CEO and cofoun­der of Kairos Power, is a new-nuke veteran, having already built, operated and decommissioned a demonstration plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “In nine years, we’ve learned a huge amount,” he says. Kairos is now building Hermes 1, its first power-generating (demonstration) reactor, as well as Hermes 2, its first commercial reactor, which aims to deliver 50 MW to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s electric grid by 2030. Google has agreed to buy, by 2035, some 500 MW of power from Hermes reactors. Kairos’ headquarters is in a converted aircraft hangar at the former Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, just south of UC Berkeley, where Laufer and his two cofounders got their doctorates. The startup expects $303 million in funding from DOE by the time it completes Hermes 1 in 2028. (Laufer refuses to say whether his billionaire father, Henry Laufer, a mathematician who built hedge fund pioneer Renaissance Technologies with the late Jim Simons, is a backer.) The prefabricated modular Kairos system capitalizes on decades of advances with a molten fluoride salt-cooled reactor design. It uses a novel “pebble” fuel known as TRISO (for tri-structural-isotropic). This fuel is a feature of several new reactor designs, and a big reason why backers claim the new systems are both meltdown- and terrorist-proof. Tiny uranium dioxide kernels (the size of poppy seeds) are coated in millimeter-thick layers that insulate the uranium and contain dangerous fission products. Kairos then encases the TRISO in graphite to form pebbles the size of golf balls. When a lot of these pebbles are close together they can initiate fission reactions, yet the multilayered coatings aim to prevent the fuel from ever getting hot enough to initiate a runaway chain reaction (or meltdown). Backers claim that even if bad guys stole the thousands of TRISO pebbles in a mini-reactor, they’d be hard-pressed to do anything dangerous with them, and if they blew up a reactor, a cleanup crew would be able to go in after and safely pick up the pebbles. Kairos has devised its own TRISO production line, which is now being moved to DOE’s Los Alamos National Lab site, so it can finally “pelletize” actual enriched uranium. “In-house manufacturing is a key part of our strategy,” Laufer says. Isaiah Taylor, the 26-year-old founder and CEO of two-year-old Valar Atomics, also plans to use TRISO fuel but isn’t producing it himself yet—he’s too busy developing what Steve Marcus of Los Angeles–based Riot Ventures, which seeded Valar, describes as “the Toyota Corolla of reactors, not a Lamborghini.” In September, the El Segundo, California–based startup broke ground in Utah on its first demonstration reactor. In November, Valar announced a $130 million funding round and said it had achieved zero-power criticality (fission but no electricity) in a test of its reactor core at Los Alamos. It’s not clear if zero-power criticality meets Trump’s goal. Regardless, Taylor expects to achieve full reactor criticality (generating electricity, that is) by the president’s July 4 deadline with his “Ward 250” high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor design (named after his grandfather Ward Schaap, a scientist on the Manhattan Project). Valar has already built a thermal prototype that gets subjected to the same operational temperatures and pressures, but without the uranium fuel inside. “We dump 16 city blocks of L.A. power—half a megawatt—into the core,” says Taylor, whose team has discovered leaks and learned valuable skills by repeatedly taking their prototype apart and putting it back together. Taylor is a man in a hurry. The Idaho native dropped out of high school at 16 and spent what would have been his college years teaching himself nuclear engineering. His gung-ho attitude appeals to both funders and MAGA influencers. “He has the unique ability to be persuasive and get people to join the mission,” Marcus says. Fittingly, another Valar investor is Palmer Luckey, the billionaire who was featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list in 2014, sold his virtual reality firm Oculus to Meta when he was just 21 and cofounded high-tech weapons maker Anduril at 24. This year Valar joined a lawsuit filed against the NRC claiming it was taking too long to permit new nukes and might not have the authority to regulate mini-reactors anyway. (Other plaintiffs in the case are startups Last Energy and Deep Fission plus Texas, Utah, Louisiana, Florida and the Arizona legislature.) The case has been stayed for settlement talks. “We need nuclear now,” not after a three-year review process, says Deep Fission CEO Liz Muller, 47, who founded the startup with her father, a retired UC Berkeley physics professor. The two-year-old startup raised $30 million in a September public offering. Its unusual approach involves boring a 30-inch-diameter hole a mile down into the earth, lowering a uranium fuel containment canister into it and filling the hole with water, which will be heated by the reactor to generate power, while keeping the reactor safely ensconced in solid rock. “Over the next two years we’re going to see who can actually start to build and who can’t,’’ Muller says. One startup that has cashed in on the hype without even building a pilot plant is Oklo, founded in 2013 by husband and wife Jacob and Caroline DeWitte. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was its chairman from 2015 until April. The company went public via a SPAC in 2024, and its market cap of $15 billion (down from a $26 billion peak in October) makes both DeWittes billionaires. While Oklo has begun prep work on a site adjacent to Idaho National Lab, it’s unlikely to reach criticality by next July 4. Still, it has friends in high places; energy secretary Chris Wright was formerly on Oklo’s board. It’s the highest-profile of a half-dozen publicly traded mini-nuke companies. “[Oklo’s] stock is very symbolic of what public opinion is; everybody’s pro-nuclear and wants to be invested in it,” Riot’s Marcus says. It’s worth noting that even the wealthiest, most intelligent and most powerful people on the planet can’t just will a new reactor into being. Bill Gates cofounded TerraPower in 2008. After 17 years and close to $4 billion in investment from Gates, DOE, Nvidia, HD Hyundai and others, it still doesn’t have the NRC’s approval for its 350 MW molten salt reactor design. There’s also a chance, particularly given Trump’s constant flip-flopping, that old-fashioned big nuclear plants, not factory-built units, could be the future. Having gone through bankruptcy and multiple ownership changes in the past decade, Westinghouse received a fresh lifeline in October when the Trump administration pledged to help expedite permitting and financing for $80 billion in new reactors (enough to build anywhere from five to ten Westinghouse AP1000s) in exchange for Uncle Sam taking a 20% “participation interest” in any Westinghouse profits above $17.5 billion generated by 2029. That’s terrific news for Amarillo, Texas–based Fermi America, which has minted the richest new nuclear billionaire: cofounder and CEO Toby Neugebauer, 53. A private equity investor and son of a former Republican Congressman, Neugebauer (and his family) saw their net worth hit $6 billion after Fermi went public in October. Fermi’s plan is to build colossal data centers powered by at least four AP1000 reactors on 5,000 acres adjacent to Pantex, a DOE outpost in the Texas panhandle that for decades has manufactured the plutonium heart of nuclear warheads. “If you can’t build nuclear power on this site, you can’t do it anywhere,” says Neugebauer, whose cofounders are Rick Perry (the former governor of Texas and Trump’s first energy secretary) and Perry’s son, Griffin. Like many AI companies, Fermi is close with the administration. Neugebauer chose Cantor Fitzgerald, controlled by the family of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, to arrange its IPO. Another Lutnick-controlled company, real estate broker Newmark, reportedly earned millions in fees securing land for Fermi. "The reason we do nuclear is we are patriots," says Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer. "China is building power out the wazoo. That’s why we need nuclear AI." Plus, Neugebauer is a project developer, not an innovator. He has hired as his chief nuclear construction officer Mesut Uzman, a Turkey-born U.S. citizen who helped manage the building of the first four AP1000 reactors in China, then another in Bulgaria and four more in the UAE. “We have someone who is not a virgin. He’s got 13 kisses under his belt,” brags Neugebauer, who says that once the small nuclear reactor guys are ready, he’ll happily build multiple gigawatts of them on the site, too. Neugebauer is also hedging his nuclear bet: He already has 2.5 GW of natural gas turbines on order and intends to build 11 GW of gas power before his first reactor is complete. But his long-term vision is for Amarillo to serve as the federal government’s hub for atomic-powered artificial intelligence. “The reason we do nuclear is we are patriots,’’ he says. “China is building 33 [large] reactors, not for air conditioning. They are building power out the wazoo. That’s why we need nuclear AI.”

Title: Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Smart Glasses Get 20% Price Drop Ahead of Black Friday

Meta is tossing out a limited time 20% discount off all Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) smart glasses, which you can nab from now until December 1st. Released in 2023 starting at $300, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) are capable smart glasses in their own right, including video/photo capture, onboard AI assistant, and the ability to play music and take calls. The second gen version released earlier this year, starting at $380, bringing with it better battery life, higher-quality video capture, and improved audio/mics. You can check the spec sheet below for a 1:1 comparison. Still, at $240, Meta’s latest deal makes Gen 1 the cheapest it’s ever been, with the 20% discount available across all Gen 1 lens and style combos. You can get the deal from now until December 1st direct through Meta, which includes expedited shipping, as well as partner retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Ray-Ban Stores, and Target in the US. Many supported regions are getting the deal too, which you’ll find in local pricing across Europe, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK. Meta is also tossing out 20% off prescription lenses when you purchase Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1 and 2) and/or Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, which will only be available through Meta from now until December 1st. While Meta is clearly using the big Black Friday sales rush to flush old stock, I honestly hoped for a much larger barn burner, although it’s pretty clear why we’re not seeing the any super deep discounts. As occult corporate calculus goes, Meta and EssilorLuxottica probably don’t want to make Gen 1 too attractive to people who might otherwise just spring for the more expensive Gen 2. This makes me think that 20% off is about as low as Meta will go this year around, although I’ll be keeping my eye on post-Black Friday sales to confirm. Still, there are some caveats potential buyers should be aware of: neither are better at capturing video than your smartphone, and they don’t play music better than even mediocre wireless ear buds. You also have to use Meta AI, which is… okay, making it more of a fun toy (or Christmas gift) than a must-have addition to your smartphone. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. See here for more information. TL;DR: What if the only reason they sell is because they are pretty? I REALLY want to see real world usage statistics. There is no doubt some actual utility you can get from AI assistants, and taking pictures has been the main use of glasses like HMDs since Google Glass. But as far as I can tell people could still mostly buy them as fashion accessories because they are Ray Bans. Everybody incl. Apple and Samsung are now struggling to catch up with Meta's surprising sales hit, but this is all on the promise that people will somehow use them as their first steps into a sort of AI assistant real world metaverse. And that may be a big miscalculation if they are bought primarily as (photo) glasses. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses seriously upgrade the number of use cases, but currently lack an SDK that would allow custom apps, with Meta only offering one to developers for connecting smartphone apps to the glasses. And the display glasses come with significantly increased size and weight, no longer as unsuspicious as their regular smartglasses, and at a much higher price that very likely still makes Meta lose money on every single sale. The potential is no doubt there, but we are still very far from smartglasses doing even a small fraction of what smartphones can do today. So while we are seeing regular reports on how well they sell and what Meta does to push them further into the mainstream, what we'd really need is more info on how impactful the smart part of smartglasses is in reality. Or if everybody is just chasing large user numbers, blindly hoping they will somehow magically translate into the next smartphone-like platform in the future. Yes, they're pretty and they take pictures. That's the Trojan horse through which we hope to arrive to the other stuff once they are on the head of people For Meta it doesn't really matter if this works or not, as long as Facebook and Instagram keep laying golden eggs that pay for everything that Zuckerberg wants and gets due to his class B shares in Meta Platforms. These come with 10x the voting power of the publicly traded class A shares, giving him 60% of the total vote. So when he decided in 2021 that the Metaverse was going to happen now, that was what they went for with no way to stop or fire him. And now they are going for smartglasses, with no way to stop or fire him. If it doesn't work, he'll just try something else. The question is really how much the industry should follow Zuckerberg's ideas based on how successful they turned out to be in the past. I'm pretty sure that Apple is still serious about making Vision a viable consumer product, and they are massively investing into media like immersive live event streaming that only make sense on a high end HMD. Like the just announced Real Madrid documentary shot on 30 Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive cameras for USD 30K each. So even if Apple now rushes to release some "me too" smartglasses, we will very likely see a Vision Air in a few years. I'm not as sure about the future of HMDs running AndroidXR, which Google describes as "Android XR is an AI-powered operating system coming soon to headsets and glasses". Google being seduced by the current AI and smartglasses hype may lead to them abandoning another VR capable class of headsets to solely focus AndroidXR on much less capable AI assistants in a much smaller form factor. Which is why it would be so important to learn if smartglasses are actually used beyond the "they're pretty and they take pictures" as actual smartglasses. "Smart glasses accounted for more than a third of EssilorLuxottica's growth in Q3 2025" — UPloadVR. So people are not just buying Ray-Ban, they are buying Ray-Ban Meta. But that doesn't answer what they are using them for. The official price on the Ray-Ban website for the Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Gen 1 is USD 329, USD 459 for Gen 2, and the price for the Original Wayfarer Classic sunglasses these are based on is USD 244. And if you go directly through their AI glasses page, the Gen 1 list price is only USD 299, a mere USD 55 more than the regular glasses, though real world prices after rebates etc. may be very different. So there is quite a chance that people buy the Meta version just to give it a try, as they only add 20% to the price, and then after some initial tries never even bother to charge them. They surely are a novelty and a reason for more people to buy Ray-Ban glasses. But we know from VR HMDs that most of them end up on a shelf, with the Quest 2 and later having a much better retention rate than Rift & Co, though still only about 40%. For a device that so far has very limited use, but still works as regular sunglasses, the equivalent to "sitting on a shelf" would be "sitting on a nose uncharged/unused". I do not doubt that Quest 2 was the best selling HMD ever, I do not doubt that Meta Ray-Bans are what drives EssilorLuxottica's growth in what I'd suspect is a pretty saturated sunglasses market. What I doubt is that sales numbers represent active users numbers, basically that the features that make the Meta Ray-Ban smarter than their dumb Original Wayfarer Classic cousins see a lot of use. And that's quite crucial for the whole device category, hence my demand for usage statistics instead of only sales statistics. When a camera and a microphone and headphones are sitting on your nose — and good quality ones — you will use them. I use them all the time, to the point that I regret not getting the transition version because I want to use them indoors as well. I use the AI and live translation only occasionally, but they are very useful when you need them. When you have paid hundreds of dollar for a VR HMD with many good games available, you will use it. Or not, as the 60% that stopped using their Quest 2 a few months after the purchase. Again, I am not looking for sales numbers or anecdotes, I'm looking for usage statistics. I know they sell well, I know they can be useful, I know that some people love them and use them all the time. What I want to know is how many people that bought them still use the smart features after a few weeks, or at all for anything but taking pictures or blocking the sun. As with everything XR, numbers are hard to come by, and it took a lot of cross referencing from different sources to find out the retention rate on Quest 2, which by now has probably dropped significantly. Getting the retention rate was important to estimate how well VR is received by the average users, which provides some insight into the readiness and longterm market chances of a device. And it turned out to be not that well, with the majority not seeing the increased immersion worth the hassle/discomfort after a while, instead switching back to flat games on PCs/consoles/phones. Smartglasses users will typically also carry a smartphone that can do pretty much everything the glasses can do and more, with better cameras and a screen to see what picture you will take, but requiring to pull out and hold the device. So I'd say there are a number of good reasons why current smartglasses might be abandoned or reduced to mere sunglasses. Asking for any use other than taking pictures would probably drop the actual usage numbers even further. And what I am looking for is evidence aka statistics, not personal opinions or claims of inevitableness by individual smartglasses lovers or haters.
