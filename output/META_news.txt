Title: The Technology Shift: What To Do Now

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look. The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500. Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses: Netflix (hold) Meta Platforms (sell) Tesla (buy) Nvidia (sell) Amazon (sell) Apple (hold) Google (sell) Microsoft (cycle low in March) This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla. This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025. Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia: This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are: 1. Palantir 2. Super Micro Systems 3. Axon 4. Atlassian 5. DoorDash Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios. Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles. There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares. The cycle rises from March to June.

Meta said that the increase aims to bring executive compensation in line with other major technology firms. It’s worth pointing out that Meta announced an increase in executive bonuses soon after it laid off nearly 3,600 employees, which is around five percent of its total workforce. Furthermore, the company has also decided to reduce its annual distribution of stock options for thousands of its regular employees. Under the new plan, Meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025, which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year. A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change in bonuses on February 13th, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. The social media giant has increased these bonuses while it is in the process of laying off five percent of its global workforce. This is despite the fact that Meta’s shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year, with a current stock price of nearly around $687 per share. Furthermore, the company recently announced that its fourth-quarter revenue increased 21 percent year-on-year to more than $48 billion. It’s worth mentioning that Meta has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the past few years. While Meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year, the company’s regular employees will suffer. The company has slashed its annual distribution of stock options by roughly around 10 percent for its regular employees, reports The Financial Times. The exact reduction in the stock options could differ depending on where the employees are located and what their roles are in the organization. That said, the new bonus and stock plans will take effect from the 2025 performance cycle. As per a filing, the new bonus plan doesn’t apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, he doesn’t have to worry about his bottom line as he’s worth nearly $250 billion. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alibaba is going all in on trying to beat the US at developing AI that can reason like a human being
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-share-price-china-ecommerce-ai-agi-tech-markets-deepseek-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T07:13:27Z

Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI. "We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence," said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's "first and foremost goal." AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning. US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive "much earlier" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years. Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations. "The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value," said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work. "If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP," he said. On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025. Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said. However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified. US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China. The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again. The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday. Jump to

Title: Ecwid
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/old-e-commerce-software/28549/ecwid
Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:00:14Z
Full Content:
Ecwid should be on your radar if you want to sell digital or physical goods online, particularly if you're a newcomer to the e-commerce space. The platform differentiates itself from the competition via several notable features, including excellent website design tools, rich tutorials that quickly get you started making money online, and the ability to embed your store on third-party websites like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping. However, two caveats prevent it from climbing into the category's upper echelon: an extremely limited free tier and a lack of 24/7 customer support across its four plans. For more feature robust services that have 24/7 customer support, check out our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce platforms, Shopify and Wix Stores. Ecwid has four tiers: Free, Venture, Business, and Unlimited. Ecwid is one of the few e-commerce platforms with a free option, but the plan is quite limited. It restricts you to just five store items and email-based customer support. By comparison, Square Online offers a strong free tier that supports unlimited items and phone-based help (Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT). On the upside, you can advertise your Ecwid-powered site through Google, Meta, and Pinterest (TikTok advertising is locked behind the paid tiers), and get a free domain. The Venture plan ($25 per month or $21 per month with an annual plan) lets you store up to 100 total products in your online store, leverage live chat support when you have a question, sell on Facebook and Instagram, track inventory, and access Ecwid's mobile companion apps. The Business package ($45 per month or $39 per month with an annual plan) builds upon Venture with a 2,500-product inventory, the ability to sell via various online marketplaces (like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping), abandoned cart emails, wholesale pricing, and phone support. The Unlimited hosting level ($105 per month or $89 per month with an annual plan) removes the inventory cap, which is great for businesses with large product catalogs. In addition, you can integrate your Ecwid account with POS systems (like Alice, Clover, and Square) and enjoy priority customer support. Ecwid has zero transaction fees. However, the paid plans lack free trials. On the other hand, the Editors' Choice-winning Shopify (starting at $29 per month) offers unlimited products and 24/7 customer service across the board. You should check out that top pick, depending on your budget and the number of items you'd like to sell. Ecwid's sign-up process is extremely fast and easy; you just create credentials and name your shop. If you're new to Ecwid or e-commerce, the dashboard sets you up for success with a six-step tutorial on launching a shop and a 10-minute video that walks you through critical features. In the catalog tab, you add products, create product categories, and whip up gift cards (gift cards are limited to paid plans). Adding products is simple: You drag and drop product images directly into the window and optionally upload a product video. You feel the Free tier's limitations here, as inventory tracking and the ability to set stock numbers are locked behind the paid tiers. For example, if you only have five band shirts in stock, you cannot highlight to customers how many are available before they sell out. Likewise, uploading a product video is locked to the Business and Unlimited tiers. The Ecwid dashboard lets you create your shop's skeleton before entering the full editor. There, you'll find editing options for image and video sizes, image aspect ratios, data displayed on your product cards, and how you want your customers to navigate your store. In a nice touch, Ecwid lets you preview the changes as you implement them. Then, you choose a template from 73 premade ones. That's low compared with Wix Stores, which has nearly 1,000. Once a template is selected, you make changes using the full editor. The customization options are plentiful and, most importantly, intuitive. They let you update the site copy, swap images, and choose how products are displayed. Another welcome feature is the ability to switch templates even after going live. This isn't commonplace. For example, Wix Stores requires you to rebuild the site to switch to a new template. Although slightly bifurcated design tools risk confusion, Ecwid makes it seamless and easy to understand. It puts the right tools in the right sections and gives you many useful tutorials on tailoring your store. Afterpay, AmazonPay, Clover, PayPal, and Square are just five of the 61 payment gateways compatible with Ecwid. There's even a crypto.com option if that's your thing. If you use a supported payment gateway, follow the setup instructions to create an account and link your bank account. The knowledge base articles offer assistance when it comes time to get started with payments. Ecwid partners with Square and the physical Square Reader for in-person sales. Square is one of the most common and reliable physical POS systems on the market, so it's good that your Ecwid account syncs with the company's hardware. Shopify also handles both in-person and online transactions. You can accept bank transfers, cash on delivery, phone orders (which Volusion also supports), and check and money orders. Ecwid has a companion app for Android and iOS. The useful dashboard elements (ease of use, simple navigation) also apply to its mobile offering. The apps display your reports, lets you add products, and create barcodes for those products with your phone's camera. The ability to create barcodes is a unique feature and one we hope more e-commerce services integrate in the future. With the Ecwid apps, your shop is truly in the palm of your hand. In addition to adding products, you can manage orders, create discounts, set up payments, and manage the settings on your various sales channels (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). Free-tier subscribers can test the app with a 28-day trial. Paid users have app access included with their subscriptions. Ecwid offers phone and chat-based customer support—if you're using the Business or Unlimited plan. The Free tier lacks live support (you must visit the aforementioned user forums and help pages), while the Venture tier supports web chat but not phone help. We're not fans of this tiered-based assistance. In addition, you can only receive a call back after you place a request via chat. In short, Ecwid's customer service is needlessly limited. On the upside, phone support is available 24 hours per day (Monday to Friday). Starting a business online can be stressful, and e-entrepreneurs want to hit the ground running with as few bumps as possible. On that note, Ecwid surprised us with its sleek interface, robust tutorials, and easy-to-use website editor. That said, the Free plan is far too limited, and the tiered customer support is a notable drawback of an otherwise positive experience. If you want more robust e-commerce options, check out our Editors' Choice winners Shopify and Wix Stores. Mike Williams contributed to this review.

Title: Target is facing another big DEI lawsuit

Target (TGT+1.69%) was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price. Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller. “Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.” This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT-0.60%), McDonald’s (MCD+0.61%), and Meta (META-2.02%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

Title: Meta executive board to employees: 5% global layoffs for thee, 200% bonuses for me [Sick]

dustman81: Looking at the Meta layoffs, looks to me that they laid off for two reasons:1. Replace US citizens/green card holders with Chinese and Indian H1-Bs who work for peanuts2. Part of a Meta employee's comp is in RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). Employees who were hired during the Great Resignation had the value of their RSUs skyrocket in the previous two years as Meta's stock price skyrocketed, which cost the company money when the RSUs vested. The latest crop of hires have their RSUs set at the current, higher valuation, which will cost the company less (or possibly nothing if the stock value goes down in the meantime). mr0x: dustman81: Looking at the Meta layoffs, looks to me that they laid off for two reasons:1.

At least for engineering roles, Meta pays *extremely* well2. RSU compensation goes on the company's books when they are granted, not when they vest. It doesn't become income for an employee until it vests, though. It's also almost purely an accounting charge for the company since trillion dollar companies aren't granting enough stock to have any kind of dilutive effect anyways. dustman81: Suflig: What do you think the point of a business Meta existing IS?So Zuckerbot can buy more $900,000 watches, $300 million yachts, and $50 million private jets?
