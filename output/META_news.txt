Natural. Artificial. Collective," is set to transform Venice into a "Living Laboratory" of experimentation and collaboration. This year's special projects extend beyond the exhibition grounds, integrating into various city locations and Forte Marghera in Mestre, providing an alternative perspective that expands the reach of architectural discourse. The 19th International Architecture Exhibition, organised by La Biennale di Venezia under Carlo Ratti's curatorship and the theme "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective," is set to transform Venice into a "Living Laboratory" of experimentation and collaboration. This year's special projects extend beyond the exhibition grounds, integrating into various city locations and Forte Marghera in Mestre, providing an alternative perspective that expands the reach of architectural discourse. The Biennale promises to be a dynamic platform uniting over 750 participants from diverse backgrounds, including architects, engineers, mathematicians, climate scientists, and artists. Such a broad coalition of over 280 projects underlines the Exhibition's focus on inclusivity and interdisciplinary collaboration, an essential aspect for adaptation. The selection process proposed a bottom-up, open call approach through the Space for Ideas initiative, which ran between May and June 2024. It encouraged participation from global teams, from Pritzker Prize winners and Nobel laureates to emerging architects and scientists.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

01 May 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. Despite an increase in trading activity, Nepal’s stock market posted a third consecutive decline, with the NEPSE index dropping by 8.14 points to close at 2,623, indicating persistent investor caution. While the trading volume surged to NPR 9.37 billion, gains were limited to a few sectors such as hydropower, microfinance, and trade, while major sectors like banking, finance, and tourism experienced notable losses. This subdued market performance occurs against a backdrop of mixed economic indicators: Nepal’s projected GDP growth of 4.61% and a rise in per capita income to USD 1,517 suggest signs of recovery, especially from non-agricultural sectors. However, persistent structural issues remain—revenue collection has failed to meet targets for three consecutive years, over 29% of industries do not comply with minimum wage laws, and high-profile infrastructure projects like the Gautam Buddha International Airport suffer from weak oversight. Furthermore, policy interventions such as Nepal Rastra Bank’s plan to absorb excess liquidity and regulatory changes to procurement laws reveal ongoing efforts to stabilize the financial system. Altogether, these developments reflect an economy striving for growth amid deep-rooted fiscal and institutional inefficiencies that continue to dampen investor confidence and economic resilience. Nepal stock market drops by 8.14 points despite rise in trading volume The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index declined for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, falling by 8.14 points to close at 2,623. The day’s highest point was 2,642. Despite the drop in the index, trading activity saw a notable uptick, with the total transaction volume reaching NPR 9.37 billion—up from NPR 7.57 billion the previous day. Among 314 traded companies, 136 saw declines in share prices, one remained unchanged, and a few posted gains. Most sector indices closed in the red. The banking sector dipped by 0.70%, development banks by 1.06%, finance by 1.24%, and hotel and tourism by 0.50%. Losses were also recorded in life insurance, investment, manufacturing, non-life insurance, and miscellaneous sectors, with declines ranging from 0.07% to 1.16%. In contrast, modest gains were seen in hydropower (0.61%), microfinance (0.04%), and trade (0.40%). Gold and silver prices drop slightly in Nepal The price of hallmark gold in Nepal dropped to NPR 188,100 per tola on Wednesday, down from NPR 188,800 the previous day. Silver prices also declined slightly to NPR 1,965 per tola, compared to NPR 1,970 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Nepal’s economy projected to grow by 4.61% this fiscal year The National Statistics Office has projected Nepal’s economic growth at 4.61% for the current fiscal year, based on its preliminary national accounts estimates. This follows a revised growth rate of 3.67% for the previous fiscal year, which had initially been recorded at 3.87%. The estimate, calculated at consumer prices, points to a gradual economic rebound. The total size of the economy is expected to hit NPR 6.107 trillion by the end of FY 2081/82, up from NPR 5.704 trillion in the prior fiscal year. NRB to pull NPR 50 billion from financial system to absorb excess liquidity Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) plans to withdraw NPR 50 billion from the banking system on Wednesday as part of its ongoing effort to manage surplus liquidity. The central bank will use its deposit collection tool for a 21-day term to absorb the funds. Banks and financial institutions were invited to submit online bids by 3 PM. NRB has been conducting similar liquidity absorption operations twice weekly—on Sundays and Wednesdays—for the past 18 months due to persistent oversupply of funds in the financial sector. Per capita income in Nepal to reach USD 1,517 this year Nepal’s per capita gross national income (GNI) is projected to rise to USD 1,517 by the end of the current fiscal year, according to new figures from the National Statistics Office. This represents a USD 50 increase from last year’s per capita GNI of USD 1,467, which itself had gone up by USD 57 from the previous year. While the income trend continues upward, the rate of increase has slightly slowed. The GNI figure represents the average income per person, reflecting overall national earnings relative to the population. Revenue collection falls short of targets for three straight years Despite setting ambitious revenue targets, the government has consistently failed to meet them over the past three years. In fiscal year 2078/79, only 77.19% of the target was achieved, and just 74.43% the year before. So far this year, only 61% of the expected revenue has been collected by mid-Baisakh. However, the government continues to raise its targets, with this year’s budget set at NPR 1.86 trillion and next year’s target expected to climb even higher to NPR 1.9 trillion, as per the National Planning Commission. Subcommittee submits weak report on GBIA construction issues A parliamentary subcommittee formed to investigate irregularities in the construction of Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) in Bhairahawa has submitted a report that has been criticized as weak. Led by former tourism minister and CPN-UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai, the subcommittee failed to adequately address financial discipline, spending transparency, or provide a proper breakdown of the NPR 31.82 billion used in the project. Members of the committee included MPs such as Achyut Prasad Mainali, Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, and others. Critics, including members of the Audit Committee, expressed concern that the report ignored major issues observed during field inspections. Investment board approves structure and strategy The Investment Board of Nepal has approved its new organizational structure and business strategy during its 61st meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board has also approved the post of a secretary and directed the office to complete a management survey based on the new structure. According to spokesperson Pradyumna Prasad Upadhyaya, the board plans to sign deals for 42 major projects worth USD 17.92 billion (NPR 2.45 trillion) by fiscal year 2085/86. No progress on social media registration despite repeated orders Despite multiple government orders, platforms like Facebook have not registered in Nepal. The government has extended the registration deadline several times, but no progress has been made. Minister for Communications and Information Technology Pradeep Subba Gurung recently gave a one-week deadline, but platforms, including Facebook’s parent company Meta, have not complied. Previously, TikTok had registered after facing a ban, but other platforms remain unregistered. Non-agricultural sector expected to fuel Nepal’s 4.61% GDP growth According to the latest projections by the Central Statistics Office, Nepal’s economy is set to expand by 4.61% this fiscal year, largely driven by gains in non-agricultural sectors. These sectors are forecast to grow by 4.28%. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector is expected to record a 3.28% increase. Rishiram Sigdel, Director of the National Accounts Division, said the projections reflect continued recovery momentum, with industry and services playing a leading role. Over 29% of industries fail to pay minimum wage A new report from GEFONT reveals that more than 29% of industries in Nepal have not implemented the minimum monthly wage of NPR 17,300. The labor audit covered 327 businesses across sectors such as manufacturing, textiles, tourism, education, and healthcare, and found widespread noncompliance with labor laws. SEBON approves IPO for Bikash Hydropower The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) has approved Bikash Hydropower Company’s request to issue an IPO. The company will now issue 4.45 million shares worth NPR 445.46 million at a face value of NPR 100 per share. Prabhu Capital will manage the IPO process. Procurement rules amended again to ease deadline extensions for contractors Nepal’s procurement regulations have been amended for the 14th time to allow easier extension of project deadlines. Contractors must now submit valid reasons for project delays, and applications for deadline extensions must be filed within 30 days of the amendment’s publication in the official gazette. Yarsagumba harvesting begins in Manang The collection of Yarsagumba (Cordyceps sinensis), a valuable medicinal herb, has started in Manang district. The harvesting season lasts from mid-Baisakh to the end of Asar. Locals collect the herb with permits issued by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, following regulations and guidelines for conservation areas, national parks, and buffer zones. Nepal to import 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer for paddy farming To prevent a fertilizer shortage, Nepal is importing an additional 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer, including 94,000 metric tons of urea and 25,000 metric tons of DAP. The fertilizer is expected to arrive by the second week of Jestha, with shipments being handled by Agricultural Inputs Company Limited and Salt Trading Corporation. Gold traders can no longer charge recommendation fees Nepal Rastra Bank has barred gold traders’ associations from charging fees for issuing purchase recommendations. The new rule came after complaints about unfair charges. According to the NRB, all associations must now offer recommendations to traders for free. Hilsa border reopens but Mansarovar pilgrimage still banned Though the Hilsa border point with China reopened last year, the pilgrimage route to Kailash-Mansarovar remains closed. China shut down the route during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not reopened it since. The route had been used by around 15,000 Indian pilgrims annually before the closure. Temporary aerial tours had been launched but were later discontinued due to high costs and limited interest. Wheat output expected to fall in Kailali Wheat production in Kailali district is expected to decline slightly this year. According to the Agricultural Knowledge Center, average yield per hectare is estimated at 3.35 metric tons, down from 3.42 metric tons last year. The estimate is based on surveys in 11 local units, excluding hill areas like Chure and Mohanyal. Helicopter flights banned in Sagarmatha region during peak season Commercial helicopter flights have been banned in the Sagarmatha region during the busy mountaineering season. Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality issued a public notice warning against such operations and package sales, holding the responsible authorities accountable for any violations. Rule removed requiring manpower companies to send 100 workers abroad The mandatory rule requiring manpower companies to send at least 100 workers abroad annually has been scrapped. This provision, part of the Foreign Employment Act, was repealed through a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives. The rule had been in place since 2019 and was heavily opposed by manpower agencies.

Title: Meta Platforms crushes Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets

UPDATED 20:51 EDT / APRIL 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. delighted investors today as it crushed analysts’ targets on earnings and revenue, sending its stock higher in extended trading. The company reported first-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $6.43 per share, well ahead of the $5.28 per share consensus estimate. Revenue for the period came to $42.31 billion, up 16% from a year earlier and easily beating the Street’s target of $41.4 billion. All told, Meta delivered a net profit of $16.64 billion in the quarter, rising from $12.37 billion one year ago. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts that the company is looking for second-quarter revenue of between $42.5 billion and $44.5 billion, the midpoint of that range matching the Street’s target of $44.03 billion. She delivered the optimistic guidance while admitting the company has been hit by reduced ad spending from e-commerce exporters based in Asia. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) said on the call that the business is performing well. “I think we’re positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said, referring to the trade disruption that’s anticipated to arise from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariffs. The company said it’s reducing its forecast for total expenses to a range of between $113 billion and $118 billion, down from $114 billion to $119 billion. However, it also raised its forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous guidance of $60 billion to $65 billion. The increased capital expenditure will be directed at “additional data center investments” that aim to support the company’s ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence, it said. It also takes into account the expected increase in hardware costs, with data center servers and storage arrays likely to be impacted by the tariffs. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,” Li said. She added that the company is working to mitigate some of this uncertainty by “optimizing” its supply chain as much as possible. Li also talked about a recent ruling by the European Commission, which decided that Meta’s no-ads subscription service is not compliant with its regulations. She said the ruling could lead to a “marginally worse user experience” for users based in Europe. More importantly, it could have a “significant impact” on its European revenue, which will likely be felt as soon as the third quarter. But she reassured investors that the company is trying to resolve this issue. “We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter’s call,” she promised. Meta said it delivered $41.39 billion in advertising revenue during the past quarter, beating the Street’s forecast of $40.44 billion. Moreover, it saw its number of daily active users rise to 3.43 billion across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, rising from 3.35 billion one year earlier and surpassing the analyst target of 3.39 billion. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino told SiliconANGLE he was impressed by the resilience of Meta’s advertising business, which benefited from ad impression growth of 5% and an average price-per-ad increase of 10% during the quarter. “Meta’s execution on operating margin was also a notable positive, expanding to 41% from 38%, but we expect greater investments in AI to compress these margins later this year,” he added. “But daily active user growth remains healthy at more than 6%.” Zuckerberg said the company’s new Threads microblogging service, which is a rival to Elon Musk’s X platform, now has more than 350 million monthly active users, up from 320 million in January. He added that the company is now looking to push more ads on Threads, but Li tempered expectations by saying it’s unlikely to drive meaningful revenue growth this year. Elsewhere, the Meta AI digital assistant has grown to almost 1 billion monthly active users, up from 700 million in January. The vast majority of those users access the service through WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said. It’s also accessible through the Messenger app and Instagram, and this week the company announced it’s getting a standalone application of its own. According to Zuckerberg, the company is trying to work out how to best integrate ads with Meta AI, and also considering charging for a premium version of the digital assistant. However, it remains focused primarily on building out the product before it starts to monetize it, he said. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building metaverse-related technologies, continues to be a money pit. The unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the quarter, lower than the $4.6 billion forecast from analysts. Its total sales came to $412 million, down 6% from a year earlier and lower than the analyst target of $492.7 million. Last week, Meta revealed it was cutting more than 100 jobs from the Reality Labs unit. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Meta is on a roll, growing nicely and investing in its future with one in four of its revenue dollars going towards its capital expenditures. “The big prize for Meta is AI, as the combination of reality and advertising represents the ultimate connection of consumers to its business,” he said. “In the meantime, investors will be watching to see how Meta handles the inevitable headwinds coming its way.” Li also talked about the company’s ad revenues stemming from the Asia-Pacific region, which came in at $8.22 billion, below the $8.42 billion analyst forecast. She explained that the company had seen reduced spend in the U.S. from Asian e-commerce retailers, saying that this is likely thanks to the imminent end of the “de minimis” loophole, which allows for tax-free imports of goods worth less than $1,000 to the U.S. Although a portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, those advertisers have reduced their spending “below the levels prior to April,” Li said. Meta isn’t the only ad giant bracing itself for possible headwinds relating to the tariffs and other economic uncertainties. On Tuesday, Snap Inc. withheld its outlook as a result of the uncertain conditions, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. warned last week that it expects its advertising business to take a hit. Another major advertiser, Amazon.com Inc., will report its earnings on Thursday. Despite the ad uncertainty, investors were pleased enough with Meta’s results, and its stock gained more than 5% in extended trading. However, Meta’s shares are still down just over 6% in the year to date.

Title: Meta stock pops on stronger-than-expected revenue growth
URL: https://qz.com/meta-first-quarter-2025-earnings-ai-facebook-metaverse-1851778553
Time Published: 2025-04-30T20:48:00Z

Meta (META-2.36%) kicked off 2025 with a strong first quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results and signaling continued momentum in its AI initiatives and core advertising business. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $42.31 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase. Net income surged to $16.64 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, while earnings per share rose 37% to $6.43. That’s better than consensus estimates, which had pegged Meta’s first-quarter 2025 earnings per share at $5.21 and a 13% rise in revenue to $41.2 billion. The rosy results initially drove Meta shares up more than 5% in after-hours trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that the quarter was a “strong start to an important year.” And on the following call, he said this was a “pivotal moment” for the industry — in what he expects “will continue to be an intense year.” Leading the way for Meta was its advertising business. Ad impressions from the company’s family of apps (including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram) were up 5%, and the average ad price increased 10% year-over-year. On the earnings call, chief financial officer Susan Li said the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. Zuckerberg claimed on the call that integrating AI into its advertising department has helped drive revenue. “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in [businesses’] products,” Zuckerberg said. “I think that this is really redefining what advertising is — into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.” Meta is currently testing an ads recommendation model for reels, which the company said has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta is seeing that 30% more advertisers used its AI creative tools in the last quarter. “If we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,” Zuckerberg said. The CEO pointed to several advances in Meta’s artificial intelligence projects. Zuckerberg said that there are almost a billion monthly active users of Meta AI — and the company’s focus this year is on making it the “leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment.” He envisions a world where AI is ever-present. Already, Meta AI is hard to avoid, after the company merged it with its search bar across its various apps. “I think that we’re all going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we’re browsing content on our phones,” Zuckerberg said. The company just released its first standalone AI app. He also pointed out continued development in the company’s AI-powered glasses — “Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the Metaverse,” he said, touting the company’s collaboration with Ray-Ban (EL0.00%). Zuckerberg reaffirmed the company’s commitment to investing in these technologies — as it maintains the strength of its core platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta saw continued engagement growth, with daily active people reaching 3.43 billion in March 2025, a 6% increase from a year earlier. Meta indicated that its updated recommendation system has led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads. With its growing user count, Zuckerberg said that “business messaging should be the next pillar” of the business. He added, “I expect that, just like how every business today has an email address, social media account, and website, they’ll also have an AI business agent that can do customer support and sales.” The earnings report did have a noticeable dark spot: Losses deepened in Reality Labs, the cash-hemorrhaging division that’s home to Meta’s virtual and augmented reality hardware, software, and metaverse platforms — a $4.21 billion operating loss on $412 million in revenue. Meta lowered its projected full-year 2025 total expenses to between $113 billion and $118 billion, but increased its yearly capital expenditures to $64 to $72 billion, primarily driven by investments in AI infrastructure, Reality Labs, and other core business costs. The company has said it plans to invest up to $65 billion in AI infrastructure by 2025 — including building a data center nearly the size of Manhattan — with a strategic focus on building user engagement rather than direct monetization in the short term.

Title: Meta’s First Quarter Profit Soars 35%, Posts Second-Best Revenue Ever
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/meta-first-quarter-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T20:17:47Z

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram says it will spend up to $72 billion this year as it doubles down on AI spending Meta did not show any signs of an economic slowdown when it reported its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, with the parent company of Instagram and Facebook seeing its quarterly profit soar 35% compared to the same time a year ago. The company, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also reported $42.31 in first quarter revenue, which was the second-best quarter in Meta’s history. “We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives.” Zuckerberg, on Meta’s earnings call on Wednesday, said he believes people will soon talk to personal AI bots “throughout the day” on their phones and AI-powered glasses. He added Meta is focused this year on “deepening the experience” users have with its AI technology. Here are the key results: Revenues: $42.31 billion, up 16% year-over-year and more than the $41.22 billion that was projected by analysts. As usual, most of Meta’s sales stemmed from ad revenue, which accounted for nearly 98% of its first quarter revenue. Meta reported the average price of an ad on its platforms increased 10% year-over-year. Asia-Pacific and “Rest of World” were the two places where Meta’s sales increased from the previous quarter, while they dipped in the U.S. and Europe. Net income: Meta reported $16.64 billion in net income, which was 35% higher than a year ago. Earnings per share of $6.43 topped the $65.22 EPS that analysts had projected, per Zack’s Investment Research. The $16.64 billion profit was the second-best in Meta history, following the $20.84 billion it reported during the holiday quarter of 2024. Daily active users: Daily users of one of Meta’s apps — which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads– climbed 6% annually to 3.43 billion. Zuckerberg, on the company’s earnings call, said Threads, its X-like platform, has 350 million monthly active users. Notably, Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology — lost $4.21 billion between Jan. and March; Reality Labs continues to standout as the sector where Meta is spending more than it is making, after the company lost more than $17.5 billion on it last year. Capital expenditures more than doubled from a year ago to $13.69 billion, as Meta continues to invest in data centers for AI. Meta did not share any guidance on if it expects President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan to affect its business moving forward. CFO Susan Li, in a statement accompanying the first quarter report, said Meta was continuing to “monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the E.U. and U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.” The Menlo Park, CA.-based company projected second quarter sales of between $42.50 billion and $45.50 billion. Li, on the company’s earnings call, said the guidance’s range is due to “uncertainty” in how the macro environment will respond to ongoing trade discussions. It was a busy quarter for Meta, even by its own standards. The company started the year off by scrapping its third-party fact checking operation in favor of a feature similar to X’s Community Notes. Zuckerberg, during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” in Jan., likened the Meta fact checking team to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984.” “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship,” Zuckerberg said. That same month, Zuckerberg attended President Trump’s inauguration in Washington, D.C., alongside other tech executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; many of the president’s fans who were in town for the inauguration told TheWrap that they were skeptical of Zuckerberg’s suddenly-warm relationship with President Trump. Other first quarter headlines for Meta include the company cutting 5% of its workforce to “move out low performers” and Zuckerberg saying the company would spend $60 billion-$65 billion this year to grow its artificial intelligence team and services; Meta updated that figure in its first quarter report on Wednesday, saying the company expected to spend up to $72 billion this year. On the AI front, Meta released its standalone AI app to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI models, like X’s Grok, on Tuesday. And after the first quarter wrapped, the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta started in mid-April. The FTC claims Meta’s purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 helped it build a social media monopoly; Meta has argued it faces plenty of competition from apps like YouTube and TikTok. That case is currently ongoing. Meta’s stock price heading into Wednesday afternoon was down 9.60% since the start of the year. As TheWrap reported earlier this week, that is not out of the ordinary for the Big Tech companies, as the “Magnificent 7” companies as they are called — Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia — seeing $2.71 trillion cut from their combined valuations since the start of 2025. The company’s stock price jumped 5% in after-hours trading, following the release of its earnings report. Something that stood out from Meta’s earnings call: Zuckerberg and Li did not mention President Trump or the word “tariff” once. On the company’s last earnings call in Jan., Zuckerberg had said it was nice to have American leaders who are “proud” of the country’s tech giants. Looking ahead, Zuckerberg said he anticipates users will have a more active relationship with the content they watch. “In the near future, I think that we’re going to have content in our feeds that you an interact with and that it’ll interact back with you, rather than you just watching it,” he said.

Title: Fiduciary Responsibility On The DEI Battlefield

ByKaren R. King andCatherine Foti ByKaren R. King, Contributor andCatherine Foti, Contributor. The political and legal landscapes on DEI programs are shifting rapidly. Presidential edicts and threats of government enforcement have driven some companies that once bragged about their diversity initiatives to now renounce them. Litigation risks, employee demands, shareholder concerns, and public outrage from all sides have left much of corporate America spinning. But in all the coverage of the twists and perils in the DEI war, there is little discussion about fiduciary duty. Pundits and academics may debate the nature of fairness and justice, but boardrooms face a more practical calculation. In a capitalist system aimed at profit, how is a fiduciary to shareholders supposed to navigate this moment? Corporate success has long been associated with innovation, understanding the market, and investment in the future. In the past, before the term “DEI” was coined, corporate strategists talked about expanding market share, attracting and retaining talent, and evolving to match the younger consumer base. While liberals pushed for equal opportunity and reparative justice, corporate America has always been most responsive to its bottom line. Indeed, it is the “business case” that likely accounts for the rapid rise of diversity initiatives in the last decade. Most notably, McKinsey’s 2015 report, “Why diversity Matters,” revealed a strong link between diversity and financial performance.[1] Based on an analysis of proprietary data from 366 public companies across a range of industries in Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. The study found a linear relationship between racial and ethnic diversity and better financial performance in the U.S.: every 10 percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-executive team, resulted in an 0.8 percent rise in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). In 2018, Deloitte published a study showing similar results.[2] That study examined the financial turnaround at Quantas from an AUD$2.8 billion loss in 2013 to an AUD$850 million profit in 2017 with shareholder returns in the top quartile of its global airline peers and the ASX100. CEO Alan Joyce attributed the success to the investment in “a very diverse environment and a very inclusive culture” which “got us through the tough times… diversity generated better strategy, better risk management, better debates and better outcomes.” The Deloitte study also debunked the myth that diversity and inclusion hinders cohesion within teams. To the contrary, it found higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness. In the early 2020s, many U.S. companies publicly touted their diversity and inclusion initiatives, including Target, Cisco, Microsoft and UnitedHealth Group. In 2020, Target became one of America’s most forceful supporters of DEI, pledging to increase its Black workforce by 20% over three years and take other steps to “advance racial equity,” including establishing an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee to “focus specifically on how we can drive lasting impact” for Black employees and customers. The company vowed to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, including adding more products from 500 Black-owned vendors to stores, and pledging $100 million to support Black-led nonprofits and provide scholarships to students attending HBCUs. Target stores were redesigned with designated areas promoting “Pride” products, Black history month, and partnerships with sellers of color. But on the eve of Trump’s return to office, Target’s leadership dramatically reversed course, ending all efforts to increase diversity in its workforce, disbanding its executive racial equity committee, and changing its “supplier diversity” team to a “supplier engagement” team. It also stopped participating in external diversity-focused surveys. Target was not alone. Similar dismantling occurred at Boeing, Brown-Forman,Walmart, Google, and Meta. Consumer backlash was fierce. Various advocacy groups condemned the policy reversals and called for boycotts. The People’s Union USA designated February 28th for “economic blackout,” calling on consumers to refrain from buying goods from major offending retailers for 24 hours. On March 6th, Rev. Jamal Bryant from Atlanta and other faith and civil rights leaders, organized the “Target Fast” to begin the first day of Lent. The boycott was described as “a spiritual act of resistance.” Walmart, Whole Foods, and Amazon also faced calls for economic restraint by consumers. The economic fallout was immediate. Foot traffic in Target fell for nine consecutive weeks. Target’s stock plummeted by approximately $27.27 per share within the month of February, erasing $12.4 billion in market value. Walmart also saw foot traffic fall and over 20% drop in share price between mid-February and mid-March. In contrast, Costco had a shareholder vote on whether to review the risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives, and over 98% of the shareholders rejected the proposal. The board followed with a statement that it “believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.” And consumers are now seemingly rewarding the move with their dollars. Costco saw an increase of 7.7 million visits and its stock hit an all-time high in February 2025. Costco also was not alone. Apple’s board similarly urged shareholders to reject a similar proposal. Delta Airlines told reporters on a Jan. 10 earning call that it is not reevaluating DEI or sustainability policies because “they are actually critical to our business,” stating DEI is “about talent and that’s been our focus.” Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing announced that the company stands “firmly behind” its “integral” DEI programs because “Deutsche Bank has benefited from it.” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, in advance of a record-breaking Super Bowl LIX in terms of viewership and profit, defended the NFL’s practice of considering diverse candidates for head coach, general manager and coordinator positions “we’ve proven ... that it does make the NFL better.” The companies that have remained committed to DEI are facing pressure and threats from state AGs and federal agencies. In January, 19 states AGs collectively sent Costco a letter warning the company “end all unlawful discrimination imposed by the company through diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) policies.” Similarly, the Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into Verizon, Comcast and Disney “to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act... including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.” Conservative groups have been active in bringing lawsuits that frame Target’s plummeting stock price as evidence of price inflation due to alleged misrepresentations about the benefits of DEI. Three related lawsuits are now pending in Florida against Target for securities fraud on this theory. But significant litigation risk exists in the other direction too. Most obviously, public statements about abandoning “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” can run a company head-first into claims of violations of Title 7 and the American with Disabilities Act claims. And there exists a counterpoint to the securities lawsuits too. Those with a legal obligation to act in the best interest of shareholders can be held responsible for rash action leading to destruction of market value. While corporate directors and officers are typically protected by the “business judgment rule” from liability for business decisions that prove detrimental or unsuccessful, that protection is limited to decisions made in good faith, with reasonable care, and in the best interests of the corporation. Failure to examine the impact of DEI on corporate profit, growth, and consumer loyalty could be viewed as careless, reckless, and a breach of duty to the company and its shareholders. Some companies have already recognized the financial implications. Coca-Cola warned in its most recent annual filing that abandoning DEI could hurt business, because its diverse employee base “helps drive a culture of inclusion, innovation and growth,” and if the company’s employees do not reflect the “broad range of consumers and markets we serve around the world, our business could be negatively affected.” In any event, the Target case study is a cautionary tale against sudden reversals of corporate commitments based on the whims of the current Administration. As corporate leaders navigate the waters of the Administration’s war against DEI, a plaintiffs’ bar ready to pounce in both directions, and consumers that are fired up to vote with their wallets, failure to consider the full economic impact of DEI exposes fiduciaries to liability for breach of their duty.

European shares closed higher in a volatile session as the market responded to the news of a 0.3 per cent drop in US first quarter gross domestic product of 2025 and corporate earnings. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.3 per cent higher on Wednesday, aided by a 1.3 per cent rise in healthcare stocks. In a mixed session, the Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.04 per cent at 10,373.46. Glanbia was the biggest mover of the day on the Irish stock exchange, rising 12.65 per cent to a price of €11.40, following news that the company’s first quarter results were better than expected. The banking sector saw mixed movement, Bank of Ireland Group saw its share price drop by 3.41 per cent to €10.32; AIB Group also saw its share price drop, though to a lesser degree, by 0.76 per cent to €5.91. Permanent TSB, however, bucked the trend with a 3.33 per cent rise to €1.55 – the day’s second leap. The property sector had a more positive day, with Cairn Homes rising 1.79 per cent to €1.94; Glenveagh Properties making a 1.35 per cent jump to €1,65; and Irish Residential Properties REIT plc recording a minor jump to 0.39 per cent to round out the day. Building materials company, Kingspan fell to €74.3, a 1.46 per cent drop. London The FTSE 100, London’s blue-chip index ended the day just in the green, rising just under five points to finish the day at 8,468, a 0.1 per cent rise. The UK market slumped during the afternoon after the news of a 0.3 per cent fall in US gross domestic product (GDP) for the first three months of 2025, before eventually clawing back the losses. In banking, Barclays’ profits surged by nearly a fifth thanks to a boom in trading activity sparked by the US trade war but shares in the group fell by 1.4 per cent. The company reported a better-than-expected 19 per cent rise in pretax profits but it also said it set aside more cash for bad debts due to worries over the American economy. Drugmaker GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) said it is “well positioned” to cope with any financial impact from changes to US tariff rules, reporting a rise in sales and shares rose 3.7 per cent. Europe The European benchmark index marked its second consecutive monthly drop, however, falling 1.3 per cent. Energy was the worst-performing subindex for April, down 10.2 per cent, as the uncertainty around global growth eroded the outlook for oil demand. The STOXX 600 has recouped more than half of its losses after tumbling nearly 18% from record highs earlier this month, on signs of the White House’s willingness to ease trade tensions. Société Générale rose 3.7 per cent after the French bank reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Danish logistics group DSV advanced nearly 7.8 per cent after it completed a deal to acquire Germany’s Schenker and provided an outlook on potential benefits from the transaction. On the downside, Glencore fell 7.3 per cent after the miner and trader reported a 30 per cent drop in copper production in the first quarter.

Title: US Economy Shrinks By 0.3%, Trump Says "Nothing To Do With Tariffs"

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Americans should be patient in the face of a first-quarter economic contraction, arguing that his tariffs would eventually lead to a boom in the US economy. The economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent pace in the first quarter, weighed down by a deluge of goods imported by businesses eager to avoid higher costs, underscoring the disruptive nature of Trump's often chaotic tariff policy. Republican Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for the poor showing. "This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's," he said. "Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' Trump added: "This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!" Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, placed the onus on Trump. "We got to these numbers because of Trump's policies," Cardillo said. "They've created uncertainty and when you create uncertainty, nobody's going to put their foot on the accelerator. "We're seeing that as the earnings come out," Cardillo added. "Guidance has been pulled back." Indeed, the ongoing, multi-front trade war continues to cloud US corporate earnings season, with companies increasingly pulling or reducing guidance due to the fog of tariff uncertainties. Wall Street pared losses after the release of more upbeat economic indicators. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index unchanged on a monthly basis and stronger-than-expected consumer spending. Two high-profile members of the "Magnificent Seven" group of artificial intelligence-related megacap companies, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, are expected to post results after the bell, and upbeat results would likely reverse Wednesday's selloff. "We think it's irrational for people to sell off, particularly tech stocks as hard when we got the real big kahunas reporting," said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at InfraCap in New York. "If we had this call tomorrow, we could be trying to explain why a market's up 2%." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 466.73 points, or 1.15%, to 40,061.02, the S&P 500 fell 83.29 points, or 1.50%, to 5,477.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 343.74 points, or 1.97%, to 17,117.58. European stocks erased previous gains following the U.S. GDP data. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 8.10 points, or 0.97%, to 823.21. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.12%, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 3.70 points, or 0.18%. Emerging market stocks rose 4.65 points, or 0.42%, to 1,110.64. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed higher by 0.78%, to 580.07, while Japan's Nikkei rose 205.39 points, or 0.57%, to 36,045.38. The dollar held its gains after a swath of mixed U.S. economic data. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26% to 99.42, with the euro down 0.19% at $1.1363. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.3% to 142.75. Sterling weakened 0.5% to $1.3339. The Mexican peso weakened 0.35% versus the dollar at 19.626. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.08% versus the greenback to C$1.38 per dollar. After the weaker-than-expected read on first-quarter economic growth, the yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1 basis point to 4.164%, from 4.174% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond yield rose 1.5 basis points to 4.6626% from 4.648% late on Tuesday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, fell 4.5 basis points to 3.613%, from 3.658% late on Tuesday. Oil prices slid further, set for their largest drop in nearly 3-1/2 years as Trump's trade war eroded the demand outlook. U.S. crude fell 1.89% to $59.30 a barrel and Brent fell to $63.22 per barrel, down 1.6% on the day. Gold prices dipped in opposition to the dollar. Spot gold fell 0.39% to $3,302.72 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.66% to $3,297.00 an ounce. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

Business NEW YORK :U.S. stocks pulled a late-session rebound on Wednesday and oil prices logged their biggest monthly drop in 3-1/2 years as investors parsed news of the first U.S. economic contraction since 2022.

The tech-laden Nasdaq ended modestly lower. The S&P 500 and the Dow lost ground in April, while the Nasdaq posted a small monthly gain.

Title: Meta earnings live updates: Wall Street watching for AI spending, impact of tariffs on advertising
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-stock-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-30T14:00:59Z

It was another good quarter for Meta, which reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, beating sales and earnings-per-share estimates. Investors had been looking out for updates on its AI spending and plans, whether it's seeing any blowback from advertisers after Meta's controversial announcement that it's cutting back on content moderation, and any comments about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans and praised its Reality Labs division, which has routinely lost around $4 billion in each of the past several quarters. Meta is also raising its spending estimates for the year to invest further in AI data centers and infrastructure. Meanwhile, strong ad revenue showed advertisers weren't put off by the company's content moderation pullback which has recently begun taking effect and which includes replacing third-party fact-checking with community notes. The conversation was more muted, though, on tariffs. Zuckerberg kicked off the investor call by saying Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty," though he didn't mention Trump or his tariffs by name. CFO Susan Li similarly referenced the "dynamic micro environment." The company did speak out about the European Commission's recent decision that the company violated the Digital Markets Act. Meta plans to appeal the decision, which came with a €200 million fine, but said it expects it'll need to make modifications that "could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue" as early as Q3. The company reported revenue for the period of $42.31 billion, beating Bloomberg's consensus analyst estimate of $41.38 billion. It also issued a second-quarter sales forecast in line with expectations. Meta's stock rose more than 5% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Shares had fallen 1% on Wednesday, putting the stock down 7% so far in 2025 at the close. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked whether Meta's consistent $4 billion-per-quarter Reality Labs losses would ever come down, and if so, why and when. Zuckerberg pointed to the rising momentum behind Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, saying they've "really taken off" and just "tripled in sales" in the last year. "There are more investments that I think make sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly," he added. "If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there," Zuckerberg said. "I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that," he said, "but I think that's like the ballpark of the opportunity." Zuckerberg briefly talked about how AI is going to change how people consume and create content online. While social media platforms mostly started off as text-based feeds, then photo, and are now in the "video era," Zuckerberg said that the next big thing could be interactive content. "In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it'll interact back with you rather than you just watching it," Zuckerberg said on the call. He recently said on Theo Von's "This Past Weekend" podcast that tech will move away from mobile phone screens and to holograms. Threads, which Meta launched in 2023 to compete with X (formerly Twitter), has surpassed 350 million monthly active users, Zuckerberg said on the call. It "continues to be on track to become our next major social app," he added. AI's improvements to Meta's content recommendation systems also contributed to a 35% increase in time spent on Threads, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also kicked off the call talking about the company's AI work, calling this "the major theme" at Meta right now. He listed 5 ways AI usage is playing out at Meta: "Improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, meta AI, and AI devices." While he noted these are "long-term investments that are downstream from us," he added that he thinks further down the road the company "will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making." Both of these sentiments should sound familiar, as he's given similar remarks when pressed on the company's AI initiatives and spending in previous earnings calls. In his opening remarks, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty" — but didn't explicitly name President Trump or cite his tariffs. CFO Susan Li prefaced the company's guidance estimates by acknowledging the "dynamic macro environment" and noting the range "reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes." "We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth, and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes," she said. However, some listeners (including at BI!) noted glitches as Zuckerberg started to speak. Who the hell is running $META conference call! Keeps glitching Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro says the company's AI integration plan "not only keeps growing at an impressive rate but also does so without burning through piles of cash, unlike most of the competition." "Meta is quietly gaining ground as one of the greatest winners of the AI revolution — with still lots of tailwinds and room for expansion," he said. While tariff uncertainty means eyes are on Meta's APAC ad revenue from retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US consumers, the company is well-positioned to "free up margins from other parts of the operation without damaging its longer-term growth plans" if those figures skew lower, Monteiro adds. As EMARKETER senior analyst Minda Smiley points out, Meta's strong earnings and healthy ad business show its massive content moderation overhaul in January, which included ending its fact-checking program and switching to a community notes-based model, didn't scare off advertisers. The next test will be staying strong in the uncertain macroeconomic environment stemming from tariffs, though Meta's sheer size and reach should help safeguard them. "Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty," Smiley notes. When big tech companies like Meta do mass layoffs — as the company has done over the last couple of years — it gets plenty of attention. So you might be surprised to learn that in addition to firing thousands of people, Meta has also been hiring. You can see that story buried in the company's earnings reports. After the first quarter of 2023, Meta had 77,114 fulltime employees. Then the company pushed out huge swaths of its employees, and by the end of that year it was down to 67,317. Meta continues to cut and trim throughout the company — it just rolled out cuts to its Reality Labs division, as we note below. But at the same time, it has also been hiring! Meta now says it has 76,834 employees. That's an 11% increase over the previous year, and it means Mark Zuckerberg's workforce has almost exactly as many people as it did two years ago. Meta's Reality Labs division, which builds the Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the Horizon Worlds platform, posted a $4.2 billion loss. That's wider than the $3.85 billion loss a year ago, but narrowed from $4.65 billion last quarter. The unit remains a massive money sink, with over $50 billion in cumulative losses since 2020. Just last week, Meta laid off staff from its VR gaming teams and the Supernatural VR fitness app as part of a broader shakeup. Still, the company is keeping its foot on the gas — nearly 500 Reality Labs jobs remain open. One bright spot? Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg sported at LlamaCon, the company's first event for AI developers yesterday, have become a surprise hit. Meta is reportedly expected to launch a new version with a built-in display later this year. The European Commission, the main executive body of the European Union, recently published a decision finding that Meta breached the Digital Markets Act, a set of regulations in the bloc meant to regulate the power of six digital "gatekeepers," aka Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft. The Commission consequently fined Meta €200 million. Meta weighed in on the decision in its earnings report. "We expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025," the company said. Meta will appeal the decision but said that changes to its model may be made before or during the appeal process. The company is being closely watched this earnings season, along with its Big Tech peers, for comments about its AI spending. It raised its estimate for full-year capital expenditures from a prior range of $60-$65 billion to $64-$72 billion now. That's up significantly from its full-year 2024 capex of $39.23 billion. The increase "reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware." Meta said in its earnings report, however, that the majority of its capex this year will go toward its "core business." First quarter Revenue: $42.31 billion, +16% y/y, estimate $41.38 billion Operating income: $17.56 billion, +27% y/y, estimate $15.52 billion Ad impressions: +5% vs. +20% y/y, estimate +6.87% Second quarter forecast Full-year 2025 Capital expenditure: $64 billion to $72 billion, saw $60 billion to $65 billion, estimate $59.27 billion Source: Bloomberg data Meta stock dipped 1% ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday after the closing bell. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, while the Dow rose 0.4%. Stocks were broadly lower on Wednesday after the release of first-quarter GDP, which dropped at an annualized rate of 0.3%, but reversed the losses into the close. It seems like the Meta CEO has been everywhere ahead of his company's earnings report. From his marriage to AI trends, Zuck is getting deep this week during livestreams and podcast appearances. He opened up about the 7-foot statue he dedicated to his wife and got real about higher education. The question on everyone's lips this earnings season is how companies plan to tackle tariffs. Zuckerberg seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach when asked about it, but investors will want some answers. A day before its earnings, Meta held its first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, unveiling a new Llama API. The company also announced a standalone Meta AI app, its most direct challenge yet to OpenAI's ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was joined onstage by Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Databricks' Ali Ghodsi, underscoring Meta's push to become central to the AI developer ecosystem. The event wasn't just about product announcements — it was a calculated play to reassure investors. "I expect Meta's earnings release and subsequent call to be packed with AI news," Forrester VP Mike Proulx told Business Insider, "not only because the company is making real and tangible progress, but also to counterbalance the intense pressure Meta is facing on multiple fronts," he said, pointing to the ongoing FTC antitrust trial against the company. Expect Wall Street to listen closely during today's earnings call for signs that Meta's massive AI investments — including up to $65 billion in 2025 capex — are starting to deliver returns. Meta's X competitor, Threads, had 320 million monthly active users at the time of the company's last earnings call, adding a million new people daily. It's one of the few recent social apps to scale this quickly, and Meta is finally starting to test monetization. Last week, the company began rolling out ads on Threads globally. Still, Meta executives have said they don't expect the app to contribute meaningful revenue in 2025. For now, it's about playing the long game. Zuckerberg has said Threads could one day reach a billion users and become "the leading discussion platform." The question for Wall Street is whether Meta can sustain the momentum. Meta hasn't commented on whether the US-China trade war will hurt its bottom line, but it's another thing investors will be watching closely over the next few earnings cycles. Meta has said that 11% of its total ad sales last year came from Chinese advertisers, which could dial back their spending as the trade war looms. With tariffs on Chinese imports now as high as 145%, many companies can't afford to sell into the US market, which means there's less incentive to advertise to American shoppers. If that trend accelerates, it could negatively impact Meta's ad business. Analysts will be closely watching Meta's investments in generative AI and its Reality Labs division, which has hemorrhaged money in recent quarters. Zuckerberg has said he's happy to keep funneling tens of billions in additional capex on generative AI even as analysts and investors press Big Tech for answers on when they'll see the massive spending pay off. Meta recently held its inaugural LlamaCon, an AI developer conference. The conference featured remarks from Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. On Tuesday, the company also announced a standalone Meta AI app to compete with ChatGPT. Wells Fargo said it expects Meta to be the "steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm," arguing that its dominance relative to other advertising platforms should shield it from some of the macroeconomic pain. "Checks indicate ad spend growth on Meta moderated throughout the qtr, but likely more resilient vs. other ad platforms against softer macro backdrop given minimal brand exposure," Wells Fargo said. The bank said Meta's Reels platform, which directly competes against TikTok, should have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban earlier this year. "Checks suggest ad spend on TikTok shifted to Meta during the heightened uncertainty in Jan, with some budgets permanently moving to Reels," the bank said. Wells Fargo rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $752 price target. A major topic during Tesla's earnings call last week was blowback over Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration. While Zuckerberg's ties to the White House aren't as deep as Musk's, he has been increasingly involved with Trump 2.0 — and investors could make it known whether they approve. Zuckerberg has had a contentious relationship with the president over the years; Trump once threatened the Meta CEO with life in prison. However, since the election, Zuck has seemed to try to smooth things over. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and Zuckerberg was among the tech billionaires who got a front row seat to the swearing in This year, Meta partnered with the White House to bring the Easter Egg Roll. Despite macroeconomic concerns, JPMorgan said that Meta's strong execution and AI opportunities should help the company's results. "We believe META remains well-owned driven by strong execution & growing AI monetization," JPMorgan analysts wrote. "We're bullish on AI-driven Ad improvements, video unification, WhatsApp Ads, Llama, & Meta AI." The bank said it believes investors expect Meta Platforms' revenue to grow by about 13% year over year. Meeting or beating those expectations would likely boost the stock. It said that while macro factors are a concern, "tens of millions of advertisers should prove relative insulation." With regards to capex, JPMorgan expects the company to maintain its aggressive investment philosophy to capture the AI opportunity. "Our $108B 2025 GAAP expenses is below Meta's $114B-$119B guide as we expect META to rationalize expenses against lower growth," JPMorgan said. JPMorgan rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $610 price target. Investors will be watching closely to see if Meta's Reality Labs — its hardware and virtual reality division — is cutting back on its burn rate after racking up more than $50 billion in losses since 2020. The division, responsible for products like Quest headsets and smart glasses, was reorganized in January with key leaders now reporting directly to Meta's top brass. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has called 2025 "the most critical" year for Reality Labs, writing in an internal memo obtained by BI earlier this year that it could determine whether the effort is remembered as a visionary feat or a "legendary misadventure." He also stressed that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for Meta's metaverse ambitions to stay afloat. Bosworth said Reality Labs grew sales 40% in 2024 and cited "massive" growth in wearables. But investors will want to see if those revenue gains are enough to begin narrowing the division's steep losses, which totaled $4.4 billion in Q3 of 2024 alone. Bank of America is leaning bullish on Meta heading into its coming earnings release. The bank said takeaways from Alphabet's comments on YouTube and its advertising checks should fuel a "modest beat" for Meta. Meta's workforce reductions in February and recent layoff announcements related to its Reality Labs division suggest that management is laser-focused on controlling operating expenses. "For expense guide, we would expect a trajectory toward the low end of the current $114-$119bn 2025 range," Bank of America said. The bank is also bullish on Meta's growing AI capabilities and its potential to unlock more advertising spending. "We think Meta's Al driven ad improvements still have several quarters to play out and for 2025 we see strong drivers of growth, including: 1) Expanding AI/ML ad capabilities, 2) Growing SFV usage aided by AI suggestions, 3) Growing messaging revenues, & 4) Monetization of untapped surfaces (Threads, Meta Al, Marketplace)," the bank said. SFV refers to "short form video." Bank of America rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $640 price target. An elephant in the room is the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial against Meta. The company isn't expected to discuss the ongoing case during its earnings call, and the litigation isn't expected to have a significant impact on the results. The trial kicked off earlier this month, and Zuckerberg testified over three days. The FTC alleges that Meta, then Facebook, violated US antitrust laws when it bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. Asked about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, Zuckerberg testified that he considered having Facebook build its own photo-sharing service, but ultimately, "I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them." Meta's attorneys have argued that the company still faces competition from social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube, and X. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Meta's Reels platform has the potential to drive significant growth for the company. "We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions," Goldman Sachs said. On the spending front, the bank expects Meta to "somewhat pull back" on its planned investments due to macroeconomic headwinds. Goldman expects 2025 total GAAP expenses of about $110.5 billion, slightly below the company's guidance range of $114 billion to $119 billion. "For META, we see the key debates being how the company indicates a framework of balance between long-term investments and annualized operating costs if the macroeconomic environment impacts the business in the coming quarters," Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $685 price target.

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. American recession and USA economy contraction cycle as a US decline The quite rare Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) last week has been supported by the early action this week which adds further weight to the bullish case. This is quite interesting in light of the major earnings out this week from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close today. They will be followed on Thursday by earnings from Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Performance Table All of these four stocks have performed quite well over the past 5 days led by a double-digit gain for META up 10.83%. There are solid gains for the other stocks with 8.2% for AMZN, MSFT + 7.4%, and AAPL up 5.7%. During the same period, the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 5.16%. RS MSFT, META, AAPL, AMZN These six-month charts all show the steady declines from early in the year. The declining 20-day MAs (blue) for all are below their 50-day MA (in red) despite the recent sharp gains. Below the candle charts is plotted the relative performance (RS) which reflects the ratio of the stock price to the S&P 500. All except MSFT are lower than the SPX over the past month except MSFT as it is up just over 4%. Over the past three months, all four stocks have been weaker than the SPX which is down 7.92%. The worst performer has been AMZN which is down 20.96%. On the charts above only the RS pattern for MSFT shows signs of a bottom as it has formed higher lows, line b. A move in the RS for MSFT above the downtrend, line a, would be a positive development. The lower lows in the RS for the other three stocks and the sharply declining MAs suggest it is too early for a sustainable bottom. Spyder Trust With A/D Lines As for the overall market, the Spyder Trust (SPY) is up 0.7% this week and is well above the tentative May pivot at $534.51. The declining 50-day MA is at $559 and the 100-day at $577.85. The 20-day EMA has turned up slightly at $541.49 and represents good support. More importantly, the S&P 500 A/D line has now moved above the major resistance at line a. This indicates that the decline from the late 2024 highs is over. A retest of the breakout level is always possible, especially with the key earnings and monthly jobs report this week. The NYSE Stocks Only A/D line is still below its downtrend, line b, but is well above its EMA which is now rising. The NYSE All A/D line closed at its downtrend, line c, as the short-term resistance at line d, was broken last week. The Nasdaq 100 A/D (not shown) has also completed its correction and the relative performance indicates that QQQ is starting to lead the SPY. Based on the data through Tuesday’s close, all the weekly A/D lines should close positive this week. These developments further support buying on market corrections.

Title: Weaker Than Forecast GDP; Meta And Microsoft Announce Earnings After The Close

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Microsoft is scheduled to release earnings tonight after the market closes along with earnings due ... More out from Facebook parent, Meta Platforms. (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks closed modestly higher on Tuesday with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 all posting gains of around 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performer, up 0.8%. The economic data and earnings reports began building momentum as well and will pick up speed on Wednesday. Overnight, there were a couple of notable earnings announcements worth mentioning. Starbucks missed on both earnings and revenues. The coffee company also said same store sales fell for the fifth consecutive quarter and looking forward, there could be headwinds from tariffs. That stock is indicated lower by around 8% in premarket. Caterpillar also announced earnings. This is a company that will likely be very sensitive to tariffs. Nearly 10% of sales come from China and Brazil represents 6%. Like many companies, Caterpillar provided guidance for two different scenarios and investors seem to like the outlook as the stock is higher in premarket by 3%. On the economic calendar, we have some big reports out Wednesday morning. Both the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index and first quarter GDP are either out or will be released later in the day. Forecasts for Core PCE, which removed food and energy, are for an increase of 2.6% year-over-year and 0.1% month-over-month. If you add back food and energy, the forecasts are for increases of 2.2% and flat, respectively. The actual PCE numbers will be released later this morning. GDP was forecast to have gown 0.1% in the first quarter, but the preliminary reading released today shows GDP actually contracted 0.3%. On a related note, the effects of the trade war are being seen in places other than the U.S. China reported April exports were at the lowest levels since COVID-19. Manufacturing is also slowing, hitting its lowest level in more than a year. China has insisted it will not bend to President Donald Trump's tariffs, but with multiple signs of economic weakness permeating their economy, there will certainly be pressure to resolve the situation. Back here at home, the tariff impact is causing several companies to pull forward guidance or issue multiple forecasts that account for variations in economic conditions. This is something I discussed Monday, and I expect this trend will continue. Retailers such as Target and Walmart, which have thus far managed to avoid price increases, warned of higher prices being an inevitability. Also, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal, some retailers are also beginning to discuss the possibility of scarcity for certain items. There have been other reports downplaying this risk, but it is something worth monitoring. For today, there are a few things I’m watching, starting with crude oil. Oil prices fell below $60 per barrel overnight. Lower oil prices are good for consumers and show up in the lower prices at the gas station. At the same time, when oil gets too low, it can be seen as a recession indicator. I’m not convinced at just below $60 we’re seeing a red light on the economy, but it is something to watch, especially in conjunction with Wednesday’s GDP report. I'm also watching how markets ultimately interpret the economic data. The lower than forecast GDP number is a confirmation of what we've been seeing with respect to consumer confidence which has been falling. Markets have already sold off in premarket following its release. If the PCE numbers come in higher than forecast, don't be surprised if you begin hearing a lot more talk about stagflation. Finally, after the close today we have several big-name earnings. Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Qualcomm are all scheduled to report. The expected move in Meta for the rest of the week is $42. In Microsoft, that move is nearly $18 and for Qualcomm, it is $9. Then after the close on Thursday, Amazon and Apple will report. For Amazon, the expected move is $12 and for Apple, it is $9. These numbers are important for both stock and options traders as it gives you an idea of the range in which these stocks are expected to trade this week. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Title: Meta Earnings: AI Push, Tariff Impact, & Ad Revenue Are In Focus

More 2025, shows the logo of Meta, the US company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $740.91/share and is currently trading near $554. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $5.22/share on $41.27 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $5.40/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78; in 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. in 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $24.58 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $27.89. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 23 which is near the S&P 500. Click on the chart to join Market Surge Technically, the stock is in a multimonth downtrend and trading below its important moving averages. Near term resistance is the 200 DMA line and then the 50 DMA line. On the downside, near-term support is 493 to 500. That said, the stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: Donald Trump’s first 100 days mark worst for US stock market since Gerald Ford

US stocks have lost more than 7 per cent during the rollercoaster first 100 days of US President Donald Trump’s second term – the worst start for a new administration since Gerald Ford assumed the presidency five decades ago. Wall Street’s S&P 500 has declined 7.2 per cent since inauguration day as Mr Trump’s aggressive trade agenda has unleashed waves of volatility that have rocked investors’ faith in America’s growth prospects and fuelled concerns about a tariff-induced inflation rebound in the world’s biggest economy. It closed 0.6 per cent higher on Tuesday. The last time the blue-chip index, which hit a record high in mid-February, fell further during a president’s first 100 days in office was in the second half of 1974 when Ford entered the White House following the resignation of Richard Nixon, according to Financial Times calculations based on FactSet data. US stocks were then caught up in a protracted sell-off driven by a recession and rapidly rising oil prices. Half a century later, Mr Trump’s attempts to upend the global trade system by slapping steep “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries have plunged US financial markets into fresh turmoil, strategists and investors said. “We’ve decided to have a fight with every kid in the playground at the same time,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Markets are telling us that there is doubt about whether the US has the advantage when they’ve taken on the whole rest of the world.” Investors have been left dazed by the barrage of trade-related announcements coming from the White House in recent months, according to George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. Stocks tumbled after Mr Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements on April 2nd, but have recovered much of those losses after the bulk of the levies were postponed for 90 days. “My model for where we are is Wile E Coyote with his legs spinning in the air trying to figure out how big of a cliff we’ve just jumped off,” Mr Pearkes said. The market decline this year has caught off guard most Wall Street investors who had forecast a market boom under a tax-cutting, deregulatory Republican administration. More than 10 of America’s largest banks have in recent weeks slashed their end of year S&P 500 price targets amid an exodus of capital from dollar-denominated assets. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said investors “have a right to feel exhausted”. Mr Trump’s “liberation day” tariff blitz “catalysed the market chaos”, she added, “with on again, off again tariff policies promulgating maximum uncertainty periodically punctuated by statements from the administration aimed at reassurance and de-escalation”. Foreign investors began the year owning a record 18 per cent of US equities but have sold roughly $60 billion (€52.7 billion) of their holdings since the start of March, according to Goldman Sachs. European money managers have driven the bulk of the selling. Both the dollar and US Treasuries have also been hit by investors’ response to Trump’s erratic tariff announcements. In equity markets, recently high-flying US tech stocks have been hardest hit, both by Trump’s tariffs and the emergence of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which stunned investors in January when it claimed to have built a large language model for a fraction of the cost of its Silicon Valley rivals. In December, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia and Meta – members of the so-called Magnificent Seven – were among the most popular, richly valued US stocks, according to an analysis by Citigroup. All four have since become “crowded shorts” as investors have trimmed their exposure to and in some cases begun actively betting against their shares, Citi said in a note to clients this week. “Anyone who was all in on the [Magnificent Seven] has been hurt,” said JPMorgan’s Kelly. Trump himself has repeatedly dismissed the negative market reaction to some of his tariff announcements, and may have graded his first 100 days “on the basis of whether he’s done what he said he would, rather than on whether the results have so far been good or bad”, said Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tesla sales fall while its stock rallies – what this tells us about perceptions of Elon Musk

Associate Professor (Strategy and Organisation), School of Management, University of Bath Akhil Bhardwaj does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. University of Bath provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Electric vehicle maker Tesla recently shared the news of disappointing first-quarter results when its earnings report was weaker than most Wall Street analysts had expected. Tesla’s revenue had tumbled 9% and its profit was down 71%. Typically, this would result in a sharp decline in investor confidence and share prices. Tesla’s share prices have indeed dropped over 40% this year. But after the earnings report, Tesla’s stock rallied when CEO Elon Musk vowed to scale back his involvement with the US Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and focus on Tesla instead. He said that he would spend a day or two a week on government matters at president Donald Trump’s request. In any case, Musk is a “special government employee”, which means he can work in that role for 130 days in a year. Assuming his role started on January 20 – Trump’s inauguration day – it would need to be terminated by the end of May had he continued to work five days a week. Tesla maintains that the slump in its earnings can be attributed to many factors, including concerns about supply chains and tariffs, as well as energy prices. But Musk’s unpopularity has probably affected sales, with his approval among consumers souring. There will be a multitude of factors at play that can explain Tesla’s decline. What is less ambiguous is the response of the market to Musk – just the fact that he said that he would devote time to Tesla rallied the investors. Apparently, the boss’s attention is highly valuable. To some extent, this is not surprising – what a CEO (or leader) chooses to focus on and what they ignore sets the tone within a firm. That said, it hardly seems to be the case that this is about setting a tone. Rather, the market (or the investors) seems to trust Musk. This is no mean feat for a CEO prone to engage in bluster. This investor trust contrasts with consumer trust and goodwill, which seem to be eroding at the same time. Musk has been called an absent CEO and analysts have noted that the demands on his time imply that he cannot be very active in running Tesla. Perhaps that is true. Or perhaps Musk thinks that Tesla is too big to fail and will be protected by the US government. Short-term bumps are less relevant for a firm that is pivoting away from its core business, as Tesla now appears to be doing. Musk has stated that Tesla is increasingly an AI and robotics company, saying this is where the firm believes the “future lies”. Setting aside energy, data is one of the most important resources powering AI. It is the key input for training large language models (LLMs) and machine algorithms. The quality of an AI algorithm is directly correlated with the data it trains on. The larger and more diverse the data set, the better (and more lucrative) the AI agent is likely to be. There seems to be substaintial overlap in the data that AI has been trained on, although details are closely guarded. In addition, there is a possibility of training data running out, which makes it an even more precious resource. Companies from OpenAI to Meta seem to be scraping the internet for the same publicly available information (while apparently ignoring copyright issues). Now Musk seems to have access to an unprecedented amount of data that is not available to his competitors. His department at Doge has reportedly pushed for access to sensitive social security information, for example, that includes dates of birth, citizenship status, income, addresses, other tax-related information. Musk-owned interests have also developed an LLM chatbot called Grok. And while Musk and his spokespeople deny that they have siphoned data for training AI models, there seems to be some indicators that this could potentially be done. It appears that Musk has manoeuvred himself into a position where, despite his unpopularity among car buyers, he can still ensure that his companies will thrive. But what does Trump get in return? After all, the president of the US considers himself a dealmaker. At least one analyst has suggested that Musk is the “fall guy” to take the hit when the Doge cuts begin to bite ordinary Americans. Regardless, it does appear that some sort of bargain has been struck between Musk and Trump. And it seems to be paying off for Musk – regulations around self-driving cars have been slashed, leading to another surge in the price of Tesla stock. Trump has also signed an executive order for AI education in primary and secondary schools. This is sure to increase the size of the market, which is clearly good news for companies in the AI sector. It would be foolish to underestimate the world’s richest man or to bet against him. But it’s important not to lionise CEOs to the extent that they become cult figures. In the Wealth of Nations, 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith made the point that the butcher, brewer and baker do not act from altruism. Instead, it is their own self-interest that puts food and drink on people’s tables. We are far better served keeping that in mind to make sense of the actions of Musk – or the investors in Tesla.

Yves here. Get a cup of coffee. This is a meaty discussion of where we are and where we may be heading with our oligarchs’ schemes against the general public getting a ginormous boost from the Trump demolition project. If you don’t have the time to read this talk in full, do at least read Michael Hudson’s opening remarks. The fact that the plutocrats will wind up worse off, even if their relative advantage increases, seems not to have occurred to them. More and more severe contagions? Worse medical care, even at the top? Remember that the surgeon who operated on Ronald Reagan’s gunshot wound (after the hospital’s head surgeon was talked out of it) was the ER doctor who had the most experience in gun wounds….as in treating the riff raff who happened to shoot each other in weekend rows or gang dustups. Similarly, a doctor at one of the top West Coast hospitals told me that the dirty secret of concierge medicine was that those doctors were generally much less good (despite typically superb bedside manner) because their patients were on average much healthier than the population as a whole. That meant they got much less practice with cases that were hard to diagnose and/or treat. Originally published by the David Graeber Institute Nika Dubrovsky: Hi everyone. It’s a real honor to welcome you on behalf of the David Graeber Institute. We’re especially grateful to our speakers — many of whose work aligned closely with David’s thinking and values — for joining us to reflect on how radically our world is changing. It’s in this spirit that we hope to better understand the transformations unfolding around us. Today’s conversation marks the beginning of a new series of public discussions hosted by the David Graeber Institute. With that, I’m happy to hand over to Ann Pettifor, who will be moderating today’s session. Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years.

And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China.

So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe.

And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek.

But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt.

We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased.

And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged.

Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent.

Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated.

Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere?

DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps?

And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China.

This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition.

And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute.

So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent.

DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing.

Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital.

And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency.

Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe.

Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them.

You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence.

It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971.

Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital.

Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this?

Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis.

OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction.

Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar.

Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent.

So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view.

So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped?

Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure?

Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps?

So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality.

Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question?

He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many.

In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom.

And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China.

And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere?

What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role.

Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed.

So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right.

What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role.

So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right?

Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Thanks, brilliant post! I love a good modern day take on rentierism. My (old school Scottish National Party) Director of Studies at my Cambridge college spent 55 minutes of a supervision teaching us the university mandated nonsense. Then he’d tell us “this is NOT for the economics exam. It’s how things really work”. He’d then take 5 minutes to explain how Smith hated the rentiers, how Henry George made the same case but from the progressive end of the political spectrum etc. Unfortunately it took me years to fully accept all that. But I got there in the end and also got into MMT and its associated stuff. “They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was.” Cory Doctorow, the early years, talked about this and about the great weakness of Intellectual Property which is that the concept seeks to own an idea, a thought. And so while Louis B. Mayer could boast that the movie business allows you to sell something while still owning it–charge a rent–the move to digital meant that movies were no longer two mile long strips of celluloid but a collection of pixels that could fit on a thumb drive. The “ownership” side of the great scheme was suddenly in peril. So that’s a new wrinkle to our new age where physical things are replaced by digital things. And just as the movie industry is now going down the tubes the useless eaters around Trump and the man himself are fighting a rear guard action against countries that actually make things while we, as Larry Summers said, give them pieces of paper. Money too has become an idea of power without even a physical token. Trump just got rid of the penny. The rest to follow? Haven’t yet the time to read the entire post, but if we are talking paradigm shifts, I could offer a couple of obvious ones; Millions and billions of people working COLLECTIVELY, then having to save individually is one of the greatest scams in history. As people are linear, goal oriented creatures in this cyclical, circular, reciprocal, feedback generated reality, we see money as signal to save and store, while markets need it to circulate. Consequently Econ 101 considers it both medium of exchange and store of value. These are not synonymous. In your body blood is the medium, fat is the store. Mix them up and see how long you live. Roads are a medium, parking lots are a store. If we treated roads like we treat money, everything would be paved over, but we would still be fighting over the lots. As a medium, you own money like you own the section of road you are on, or the air and water flowing through your body. Given it is a social contract, not a commodity, storing the asset side of the ledger requires a debt on the other side. So much of our economic activity is primarily designed around generating debt in order to store the illusion of wealth. As states function as super organisms, government forms as the nervous system, while money and banking approximate blood and the circulation system. We have evolved enough to understand that as the purpose of government is the health of the entire society and not just the accumulation of power by those at the top, it qualifies as a public utility. We have yet to understand the same principle applies to banking. Consequently the banks are having their let them eat cake moment. “Roads are a medium, parking lots are a store. If we treated roads like we treat money, everything would be paved over, but we would still be fighting over the lots.” More like all roads would be toll roads. When that federal bankruptcy occurs, Blackrock will own I-70 and it will be a toll road. It’s called “disaster capitalism” when the bankers do it to other countries. …dirty secret of concierge medicine was that those doctors were generally much less good (despite typically superb bedside manner) because their patients were on average much healthier than the population as a whole. I’ve always wondered about this, or if they were burnouts or recovered addicts, but the only people I know who have access to concierge doctors are their clients. But why would our betters think any negative effects of anything would enter their bubble? They can just drink raw milk and avoid tap water. The looming botox shortage might be a bit of a hiccup, requiring the inconvenience of a quick holiday in Ireland. The medics in my family have been telling me this for several decades. If you are sick, the best place to go is a big public teaching hospital, the stats are very clear on this. There are a number of reasons – one is that the doctors in private clinics and hospitals don’t get the throughput and variety of patients to build up their skills fully. They also don’t have the benefit of daily rubbing shoulders with other specialists and picking up informal information. Another is possibly that there is an element of overspecialization in profitable procedures. Another key issue is that small hospitals don’t have the range of expertise to hand if something unexpected happens (e.g. you go in for a procedure, and they discover something unexpected outside the expertise of the hospital). Its not a particularly well kept secret that many private hospitals will put you in an ambulance to the nearest big public hospital if something is going wrong. Thanks. Another warning concerns psychiatrists. It may be a joke or stereotype but it is rooted in a crumb of truth: many are themselves “nuts”. I recognised projection in my first regular shrink in UK. He is gone and hasn’t returned. The other one gave off weird vibes to me and someone else…… he now seems much more grounded and was courageous enough to admit that the antidepressant cocktail he pushed (unsuccessfully) on me in 2015 went nowhere. Kudos. He’s really standing up for me in fights with local funders to get me the meds I need easily. I’ve a friend doing a psychology undergrad. She opined to me recently that at least 60% of her class seemed to have some sort of personality disorder or mental issue. And as for the lecturers… As an anecdote about private hospitals, a few years ago a retired cousin who spent her entire career as a senior nurse in NY came down with a particularly dangerous cancer (thankfully, she survived). As she had lots of medical contacts and good insurance she was directed to the foremost private hospital in NY for cancer treatment. They refused her – she guessed the reason was that they thought she would negatively affect their stats. My 2nd PhD student did thesis on mental health. Though I was not the clinical co-supervisor I did sit in on one or two focus groups. I tried to non verbally warn her not to reveal her own history when a client asked but she went right ahead. In the end no harm and it arguably got more out of the clients. But I’m hyper aware of the mental state of anyone I encounter working in mental health. And yeah health economics 101 is case-mix and playing the system. I must have missed this one, thank you for posting. In addition to all the great points raised, it is still a question for me of how stable “cloud capital”, crypto and all electronic tech will be in a context of unstable, and/or crumbling electrical infrastructure? (in the US, at least). All of these systems are 100% dependent on a safe (and cheap?) stable supply of huge amounts of electricity (energy). On that level, nothing has changed because, like traditional industrial production, tech systems rely on huge amounts of energy. If/when a serious crisis comes, how can one access the cloud data? how can one access the crypto etc.? And the old questions are who will control the flow of energy to power all this? Or local nuclear power? (leaving out environmental destruction and climate issues) All these techno feudalists are going to be very very sad when an EMP makes their Kingdom suddenly unfunctional To be honest I’ve been thinking for a while now that major powers (if they have even half a brain) will be working on a directional EMP to instantly bring down an enemy. Particularly if that enemy no longer has the manufacturing capability to replace loads of fried transformers. Michael: “So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of market are they going to create?…you want to free the market from exploitation…especially in the form of economic rent…” Ann: “As you know David was an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period?” I’m extremely pessimistic about this transition.” Yanis: “So if we are going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively.” For me, it”s not clear from this discussion where the progressive left and the MMT left stand on the issue of the decentralization of power and the role of the State. What is the future economic/political architecture being alluded to? Most MMTrs are hesitant to talk about ancillary political issues, so as not to invite dissension from the main points that they are making. The fact is that MMT can be consonant with policies from left to right (e.g., Cheney and Bush Jr. saying that deficits don’t matter). So MMT wasn’t the topic here EXCEPT regarding China’s keeping money as a public utility — in the Treasury (Bank of China), not a “central bank” like the Fed serving the commercial banking interests. Thus the problem with dollar domination seems to be that there is an entrenched oligarchy all over the place that is very very comfortable with using USD, because USA IS par excellence, the protector and defender of the oligarchic system and oligarchs, in most of the countries do control the levers of political power. With China, as it was with Russia, things will be sorted out when overt or covert attacks on China will be launched by the USA. So it has to get worse before there is a chance in hell to get better. Increase impacts of climate change will also help in their twisted ways… Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Unfortunately, in many economic discussions, climate change is the elephant in the room, and gets rather short shrift, if any mention at all. While climate distortations may effect the poorest countries first, and undoubtedly there will be massive migrations away from places where there is flooding by saltwater into agricultural land, or conversely, devastating droughts, ultimately those people will seek other places to survive. In short, if migration now into the U.S. and Europe is a social challenge, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Imagine regional wars breaking out over resources, land, etc., and we may be plodding our way into WW III. And the other issue that gets little attention is the idea that even with the best efforts, there may not exist, as authors like Richard Heinberg discuss, enough basic resources remaining for us to be able to have a sustainable world. Here, a rational population policy might be a good place to start. And so, unless we address this core issue of an out-of-control climate, all of our efforts may be for nought. Perhaps our primary focus needs to be human and planetary survival Yes, but some humans, and those who wield the most power, believe that they will be insulated from all this by their wealth and power. They believe the problems will be only for the “little people”. So, nothing to worry about: the High Priests of Techno-Feudalism will save the day through wonderful technology. Or, using some dark sarcasm, Nuclear Winter (Global Dimming) can ameliorate Climate Change. Our wonderful tech overlords will come to the rescue. “We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%.” Once enough people understand this is the reason oligarchs have funded the conservative and libertarian movements, we may have a chance for real political change. Then, it will be crucial to have in place the idea that in a republic, taxes are one of the most useful tools for eliminating oligarchs and their influence on the political system.

Title: 100 days in, these are the 3 ways the Trump trade fell apart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-first-100-days-tariffs-us-china-recession-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T19:47:53Z
Full Content:
Money managers came into President Donald Trump's second term on the promise of tax cuts, DOGE savings, and pro-growth policies that would juice the stock market. Many viewed tariffs as an afterthought. "This might cause some market volatility, but we don't think it will derail US growth," Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management, said of Trump's tariff plans at a conference in November last year. "Let's not forget that during his first term, president-elect Trump was quite responsive to market reactions." One hundred days after Trump's inauguration, the S&P 500 is down 10% from record highs, banks across Wall Street have raised recession odds, and investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. How did it all go so wrong? Here are the three lessons Wall Street has learned the hard way over the last 100 days. Wall Street got the biggest piece of the Trump agenda wrong: tariffs. Trump's approach during his first term might have given investors a false sense of confidence and predictability. "In his first term, he gave you all the good stuff first. He gave you the tax cuts, he started deregulating, and then he started focusing on the tariffs, and I think a lot of people expected that to happen again," James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, told Business Insider. Instead, investors were slammed with executive orders levying tariffs from the start. The final extent of Trump's tariffs still remains to be seen as the president negotiates with other countries during the 90-day pause, but investors are no longer brushing off tariff concerns as an empty threat. Some strategists remain optimistic. Jeff Schulze, the head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, was surprised by the magnitude of the president's tariff policy. However, in a recent Franklin Templeton podcast, Schulze compared tariffs to the "spinach portion of the administration's dinner" — a necessary evil preceding "the dessert portion, which is deregulation and tax cuts." Others are mapping out a worst-case scenario. Torsten Slok, Apollo's chief economist, believes that a tariff-induced recession could begin materializing by May as shipping traffic to the US slows to a halt. Investors initially believed Trump's tariff rhetoric would be checked by his desire to encourage growth in the stock market, meaning he wouldn't do anything crazy enough to spook equities. Now, it's a different story. Trump's proven that he's willing to let stocks plummet — but he draws the line at rising yields in the bond market. Twice now, Trump has walked back some of his more extreme policies after a spike in Treasury yields — once after his Liberation Day tariffs, and again after he threatened to fire Jerome Powell. "The focus is now really on the bond market, and he's willing to accept more pain and volatility in the short term on the equity side as long as the 10-year doesn't start to creep back higher toward 5% again," Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer of the Franklin Equity Group, said. "His tolerance for pain in the equity markets is particularly high." Why is the 10-year US Treasury yield coming into focus as the trade war rages on? Foreign buyers of US debt might be less inclined to continue holding US bonds if their countries are slapped with heavy tariffs, which means the US will have to offer higher yields to entice buyers, St. Aubin said. That's the opposite of what Trump, who's prioritizing lowering interest rates, wants. A lower 10-year Treasury yield will stimulate the economy by bringing down mortgage rates, business loan costs, and the price of financing government debt, Curtis and St. Aubin said. With the Magnificent Seven carrying the S&P 500 throughout 2023 and 2024, it seemed reasonable to assume that Trump's pro-business stance would keep the Big Tech rally going. But investors failed to consider the extent to which tariffs would severely damper almost every aspect of the market. As trade relations worsen, America's AI darlings — or any large American company for that matter — are at risk of being targeted by countries unhappy about tariffs, according to St. Aubin. If Trump makes it harder for imports to enter the US, foreign countries might push back with retaliatory tariffs and stop buying American goods as well. For example, Tesla is seeing plunging sales in China as local companies like BYD snatch up market share. Another large concern for the Magnificent Seven firms has been how globally integrated their supply chains are for their tech products. But on top of the trade war, growing competition in the AI space has called into question the swaths of cash these companies have thrown at building out the technology. The Trump-driven market chaos is confounding, considering tech CEOs and billionaires curried favor with the president leading up to the inauguration, Curtis said, only to see their company stock prices plummet since then. "We saw a number of the tech leaders show up on Inauguration Day, and so it has been with some surprise that things have gone the way they have gone, particularly around the tariffs and even with some of the legal cases that are continuing forward with Meta and Google," Curtis said.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta launched a standalone artificial intelligence app Tuesday, putting it in direct competition with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and marking the latest app to release as part of the larger AI race. Meta announced the app Tuesday. (Photo by DREW ANGERER/AFP via Getty Images) Meta announced the launch of the app, which features an AI chatbot and a “discover” feed that allows users to see how others are using the assistant. The app uses Meta’s Llama 4 model, which was released early this month and has been touted by Meta as being more cost-efficient than competitor models like Gemini, GPT and DeepSeek. Meta’s AI assistant could already be used on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. The app gives users access to image generation, image editing and a voice mode that can be interacted with while using other apps on a device. The AI chatbot can answer questions using the web and use information users have shared on Meta products such as their Facebook profiles or the content they like on the social media app. Those who link their Facebook and Instagram profiles to their account center can create a more personalized experience when interacting with the Meta AI app. Users with Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to interact with Meta AI on the glasses and the app, enabling them to begin conversations through the eyewear and resume them through the app. The Meta AI app also features a voice assistant demo that provides more conversational responses, though it does not have access to the internet or real-time information. Meta’s stock was up a little over 1% as of 2 p.m. EDT ( $555.30), continuing a rise following its lowest point of the year on April 21. Shares of the tech giant are down 7.3% in 2025. OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Gemini), Microsoft (Copilot) and Anthropic (Claude) all have AI Apps. Elon Musk’s xAI launched a standalone app for its Grok chatbot in January. Similar to how Meta’s AI was once exclusively on the company’s social media apps, Grok was previously limited to X, formerly known as Twitter. “With a user base spanning billions, Meta has access to rich and diverse data, meaning it can train highly optimized models across a unique data set,” Kyle Hill, chief technology officer of business technology firm ANS, told Forbes, adding, “Meta has an opportunity to stand out from the crowd, but it needs to figure out what its killer differentiator is.” Though Meta is late to launching its standalone app when compared to competitors, it has featured its AI assistant across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp since 2023, allowing its AI models to be trained with more content. Meta’s AI assistant garnered nearly 600 million monthly users as of December, according to Meta. One of the company’s AI competitors, OpenAI, told CNBC in February it was hosting 400 million weekly active users. While not having Meta’s advantage of offering its AI through social media apps, OpenAI has generated historic funding in its quest to lead the AI race. In March, OpenAI closed a $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion and marking the biggest private tech funding round ever. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok is backed by Musk, the world’s richest person, and the company’s supercomputer site in Memphis, Tenn., that is capable of training AI models at exceptional speeds.

Title: Zuckerberg Vs Musk: Who Lost More Wealth From Their Stock In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/29/zuckerberg-vs-musk-who-lost-more-wealth-from-their-stock-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-04-29T16:18:13Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: (L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, ... More Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Tens of billions of dollars in personal wealth vanished in just months. As the economy shifts and policies reset, two of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Meta (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg - are seeing the value of their holdings shrink. Not because they misstepped, but because the ground beneath them shifted: politics, markets, and public expectations are rewriting the rules of success. For more on Meta’s success see M&A: Meta’s Four Critical Acquisitions. It isn’t uncommon for founder wealth to fluctuate dramatically - mostly because the bulk of their wealth is tied to a single stock. But that shouldn’t be you. The High Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep stock-specific shocks and lower volatility, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So who lost more? And what does it tell us about the next chapter for American business? Musk lost nearly $100 billion or >20% of his net worth, while Zuckerberg, unlike the crash of 2022, saw his wealth decline by only 6.5% closely mimicking the stock decline this year. Wealth Comparison: Musk vs Zuckerberg Both remain among the wealthiest individuals globally, but the scale of the decline - especially Musk’s - is notable. So far in 2025: While much of this has to do with the broader market decline resulting from Trump’s push for tariffs, there is more to the story for each of the stocks. Tesla’s stock initially surged after Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, driven by optimism around protectionist manufacturing policies and possibly Musk’s closeness with the president. However, those gains evaporated quickly as the realities of a highly competitive EV market - including intense pressure from Chinese manufacturers - set in. Tesla’s Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries missed expectations and its margins fell to the lowest level seen in the last 5 years. Meta’s decline, meanwhile, reflects slower-than-expected growth in digital advertising and longer timelines for AI-driven monetization, alongside continued investment losses in its Reality Labs division. It’s important to understand: Wealth - specifically from stock ownership - is not taxed, and taxes are due when stock is sold and wealth becomes income. However, when billionaires pledge shares as collateral for personal loans, a falling stock price can impact debt covenants. Lenders may require repayment or more collateral if the value of pledged shares declines substantially. If borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide more collateral, they may have to sell stock - potentially under less favorable conditions. At this time: So far, no public filings suggest Musk has faced such a situation of forced liquidation in 2025 - but the risk is structurally higher compared to Zuckerberg, who has historically avoided significant personal leverage against Meta shares. This isn’t just a scoreboard of billionaire wealth. There are deeper implications: Founders’ wealth is highly concentrated in companies they run. And that means large fluctuations - but that’s fine. They can take the risk as they run those companies. But when it comes to long-term money compounding for most of us - a simple rule is - never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific risk while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 100 days into Trump's economy, one thing's clear: Americans are worried
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/100-days-trump-economy-drama-uncertainty-stagflation-consumers-tariffs-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T13:58:35Z

Good morning. Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win the election in Canada. Celebrating the victory, Carney had a message for his supporters: "As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never." In today's big story, it's the 100th day since President Donald Trump took office again. BI explored how people feel, how markets have changed, and what tariffs could mean for what's coming next. What's on deck Markets: Five charts show how Elon Musk and Tesla have fared since Trump took office. Tech: ChatGPT has a flattery problem. Sam Altman says a fix is coming. Business: Walmart is America's favorite grocer, but don't underestimate Costco. But first, what a wild start. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. He's been busy. He issued a blizzard of executive orders. He launched an unprecedented global trade war and gutted large swaths of the federal government. He spoke about annexing Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, and making Canada the 51st state. The first 100 days of Trump's second term can be defined by one word: uncertainty. Consumers don't appear to like it. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has declined every month this year — and it may deteriorate further once the full effects of tariffs take hold, a Moody's Analytics economist told BI. Peek at it through your fingers if you must — the chart above is a scary one: the S&P 500's start to the year. After Trump announced new tariffs on April 2, the stock market suffered a historic sell-off. The index then somewhat recovered, only to dip again on April 16 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower economic growth — the dreaded stagflation scenario. Through it all, one chart climbs higher: the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which has almost doubled since January. Predicting what comes next is a tall order, but implementing tariffs could result in a surge in inflation and more stock sell-offs, BI's Madison Hoff and Matthew Fox write. More reorganization in the federal government could also mean more job seekers for fewer positions, sending unemployment higher. BI examined sentiment data, markets chaos, and interviews with small business owners, consumers, and economists. They point toward one thing: Americans are worried. 1. This week is going to be huge for the stock market. Investors will get new data on inflation, the labor market, and economic growth, while four of the Magnificent Seven are set to report earnings. Each event could majorly shift markets. 2. How Tesla has suffered from Elon Musk's MAGA moment. Tesla's stock price is down 43% since its mid-December peak, and Musk's net worth has plunged by some $150 billion. Five charts show how the car company and its CEO have fared since Trump took office. 3. When could a recession happen? Apollo's chief economist outlined how Trump's tariffs — especially duties on Chinese goods — could kick off a downturn, with effects starting as soon as next month. 1. Big Law is losing top talent to AI startups. Disillusioned with Big Law's heavy workloads and the long road to partner, young attorneys are betting on AI legal-tech startups instead. Startups offer stock options and flexible work, but they still can't match Big Law salaries. 2. Activists want Meta's receipts on content moderation. Anti-hate groups are pressing Meta shareholders to back a new proposal that includes a report on how Meta handles hate speech. Meta's board has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. 3. ChatGPT can be a major suck-up. Recent updates have led ChatGPT to really hype up users, sparking debates about whether the behavior is a growth strategy or an "emergent" feature. Here's what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had to say. 1. Domino's delivery bites the dust. Domino's delivery sales fell 1.5% in Q1 as its carryout sales rose 1%, suggesting customers opted for pickup to save money. It could signal a coming change in delivery trends as recession fears rise. 2. Walmart still reigns as America's grocery king. For the third year running, more than one in five dollars spent on groceries in the US goes to Walmart, according to consumer analytics firm Numerator. But Costco is rapidly gaining ground despite the competition. 3. A federal judge seems poised to hand Big Law another win. DOJ attorney Richard Lawson argued that Trump's executive order targeting the firm Jenner & Block wasn't illegal. A federal judge wasn't having it, calling Lawson's interpretation "a pretty strange reading." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arun Kumar, vice-president and head of research at FundsIndia, has a distinct style of investing in mutual funds, one that leans heavily on value investing. Around 55% of his portfolio is parked in funds that follow a value style of investing. In an interaction withMintfor the Guru Portfolio series, Kumar shared his contrarian approach when it comes to picking mutual funds for his portfolio. “I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well," he says. What has changed in your portfolio in the last one year?I have always been equity-heavy. Currently, my portfolio is 90% equity, and the remaining 10% is in debt and arbitrage funds. I’m comfortable with this because my wife and I have active income and contribute 10-15% of the portfolio value each year. Even during bear markets, we contribute to the portfolio. However, as our portfolio grows over time, our savings might not catch up with it. There will be a time when our portfolios will become so big that we’ll not be able to add meaningfully (less than 5%) to our portfolios. At that time, I will shift to a more conservative portfolio and keep it 70% equity, 15% gold, and 15% debt and debt-like investments. How is your equity portion bifurcated?A chunk of my portfolio, 55%, is in four funds. I have a natural bias towards value investing as a style and have invested in funds that fund managers manage with a value bias. It’s split across Sankaran Naren’s ICICI India Opportunities, Rajeev Thakkar's PPFAS FlexiCap, Kenneth Andrade’s Old Bridge focused equity fund, and HDFC FlexiCap, which Prashant Jain earlier managed. Another 15% of our portfolio is to make slightly concentrated bets. I am bullish on banking as a sector and put all this portion in one banking stock. I feel that the NPA cycle has been cleaned up, and the credit growth cycle is about to start. Banks also have a strong balance sheet because they had over-prepared for covid, but the impact wasn’t as bad as we thought. Banking is a good sector going through a bad time with decent valuations, and I’m hoping for a reversal in the future. The other 15% is spread across the globe. I had taken a bet in Chinese tech through Mirae’s Hang Seng Tech ETF two years ago. It didn’t do well for some time, but started playing out in the last one year. I also had an SIP in a Nasdaq fund. When the markets crashed in 2022, I built up my position in a FAANG [Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google)] stock, which was part of that index. That stock has gone up 4x, leading to slightly skewed exposure. The remaining 5% is allocated to mid- and small-cap funds. I did not have any allocation to mid- and small-cap before and missed the whole rally. The only exposure I had was indirectly through flexi-cap funds that had some exposure to such companies. I was already too much into equities and didn’t want to get too aggressive. Over time, the plan is to gradually start building the small and mid-cap exposure.

I did not have any funds from that category, and the only allocation I had was through my flexi cap. Learning from this experience, I have now put in place a framework to play small caps. SIP can also be a simple way to build exposure. What additions are you looking to make to your portfolio?I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well. Lately, momentum-oriented funds have not been doing great, and I am looking at it, although I haven’t made up my mind. We also didn’t have many options before, but now we have plenty of them. Quality is another style that has dramatically underperformed in the last four years, and I see some early signs of a turnaround. I am now looking at quality schemes and will slowly build up exposure there. That is what I’ll focus on for the next few months. Can you elaborate on your thesis on the quality theme?Everyone wants high-quality companies with high ROCE (return on capital employed), low debt, consistent earnings, high earnings growth potential, and good management at decent valuations. It’s very difficult to get all of these in one stock. So, quality fund managers usually end up compromising on the valuations front. This overpaying has come to bite them in the past four years. When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality. But when the market starts going through a tough phase, and only a few good quality companies are winning, that’s when quality starts performing. While it’s tough to time styles, the recent underperformance and the moderating growth environment with a lot of uncertainty thrown in augurs well for quality. Overall, it seems like a good place for quality to start working again. When the tide turns is anybody's guess, but at least it’s crucial to remain consistent with our process. Also Read: Look who's making a comeback: Quality vs value investing What quality scheme are you looking at?I like UTI Flexi cap for sticking to its quality investment style even when it has fallen out of favour. Have you exited any position?I have hardly sold any of my funds since I started seriously investing in 2015. I have redeemed a few small allocations here and there to clean my portfolio. However, I’ve kept all my core holdings. I buy funds mostly by looking at the fund manager. As long as the same fund manager runs the fund, I don’t mind even if it’s underperforming. HDFC Flexi cap is one scheme that I bought due to Prashant Jain, but he left HDFC in 2022. However, I continued holding that scheme because the current manager, Roshi Jain, manages the fund reasonably well. What would make you sell?As a thumb rule, I would contemplate selling when the fund manager changes or there is a significant change or dilution from the stated investment approach. Another aspect is on the performance front. If the returns deteriorate and I am not able to understand the reason behind it, then that can be an issue. But let’s say a fund manager who follows a quality style is underperforming, and all others with the same style and index are also struggling; then it’s okay. In this case, underperformance is not an issue. In fact, I bought most of my schemes when the fund manager was underperforming. In contrast, if you’re following a certain style and are performing poorly when others following the same style are doing well, then that's a sign to sell out.

Backing good fund managers during tough phases: Buying into skilled fund managers who are going through challenging times—but sticking to their proven approach—often pays off. The magic of compounding also becomes truly meaningful once the portfolio reaches a reasonable size. It’s also important to track incremental savings.

When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality. But when the market starts going through a tough phase, and only a few good quality companies are winning, that’s when quality starts performing. While it’s tough to time styles, the recent underperformance and the moderating growth environment with a lot of uncertainty thrown in augurs well for quality. Overall, it seems like a good place for quality to start working again. When the tide turns is anybody's guess, but at least it’s crucial to remain consistent with our process.

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the S&P 500 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges. Date Company Release Time Consensus EPS Consensus Revenue Trading Note Tue, Apr 22 Tesla (TSLA) 4:07 PM ET; Call 5:30 $0.43 $21.8 B Beat? Unwind TSLA/TSLQ hedge; Miss? Add NVDS or QID positions.

Fri, Apr 26 Alphabet (GOOGL) Pre-market $1.50 $75 B Cloud/Ad beat? Lighten QID/SOXS; Miss? Dial up QID. Fri, Apr 26 Microsoft (MSF If the U.S. avoids a recession, the Magnificent Seven are poised for outsized profit growth in 2025. But even the strongest fundamentals can be shaken by market turbulence. By dynamically switching between Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies during VIX spikes and reverting to buy-and-hold when volatility subsides—and by tactically deploying inverse ETFs like QID to hedge downturns—you can both protect capital and ride the next leg of the Mag 7 rally.

Title: These 4 tech billionaires who attended or donated to Trump's inauguration lost $194 billion in his first 100 days

Full Content:
It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side. Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund. The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly. A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide. Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday. Net worth on January 20: $449 billion Net worth on April 28: $335 billion Loss: $114 billion Musk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person. Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year. After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government. Net worth on January 20: $245 billion Net worth on April 28: $209 billion Loss: $36 billion Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February. Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country. Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site. Net worth on January 20: $217 billion Net worth on April 28: $195 billion Loss: $22 billion Zuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election. Trump had repeatedly lashed out against the Meta CEO on Truth Social and suggested he should be investigated or jailed after Facebook temporarily banned Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot. Meta, the primary source of Zuckerberg's wealth, has been fighting an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the government that has not gone away under Trump. Zuckerberg earlier this month sat for three days of testimony after the antitrust trial opened. The Meta CEO testified for more than 10 hours and was grilled by the FTC's lead attorney. Net worth on January 20: $117 billion Net worth on April 28: $95.4 billion Loss: $21.6 billion While Huang did not attend the inauguration, Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural fund. Huang's wealth, a majority of which is tied to Nvidia stock, has also dropped since January, when he attended the inauguration. Nvidia stock has fallen over 21% year to date, with the company facing several setbacks that include Trump's tariffs, as the company sources a majority of its chips from overseas, primarily Taiwan. The company also said earlier this month it expected to take a $5.5 billion hit on its first-quarter earnings as a result of the Trump administration's restrictions on its chip exports to China. Other tech leaders who attended the inauguration saw declines in the stock prices of the companies they lead, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google. Though some estimates suggest the CEOs are billionaires, they are not on Bloomberg's list of the top 500 richest people, so the change in their estimated net worth since the inauguration was not publicly available. But Apple's share price has fallen nearly 14% this year, while the share price of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has fallen nearly 15% this year. Jump to

Title: 'Steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm': Why Wall Street is bullish on Meta ahead of first-quarter earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-platforms-q1-earnings-preview-wall-street-analyst-expectations-ai-2025-4

It was another good quarter for Meta, which reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, beating sales and earnings-per-share estimates. Investors had been looking out for updates on its AI spending and plans, whether it's seeing any blowback from advertisers after Meta's controversial announcement that it's cutting back on content moderation, and any comments about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans and praised its Reality Labs division, which has routinely lost around $4 billion in each of the past several quarters. Meta is also raising its spending estimates for the year to invest further in AI data centers and infrastructure. Meanwhile, strong ad revenue showed advertisers weren't put off by the company's content moderation pullback which has recently begun taking effect and which includes replacing third-party fact-checking with community notes. The conversation was more muted, though, on tariffs. Zuckerberg kicked off the investor call by saying Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty," though he didn't mention Trump or his tariffs by name. CFO Susan Li similarly referenced the "dynamic micro environment." The company did speak out about the European Commission's recent decision that the company violated the Digital Markets Act. Meta plans to appeal the decision, which came with a €200 million fine, but said it expects it'll need to make modifications that "could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue" as early as Q3. The company reported revenue for the period of $42.31 billion, beating Bloomberg's consensus analyst estimate of $41.38 billion. It also issued a second-quarter sales forecast in line with expectations. Meta's stock rose more than 5% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Shares had fallen 1% on Wednesday, putting the stock down 7% so far in 2025 at the close. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked whether Meta's consistent $4 billion-per-quarter Reality Labs losses would ever come down, and if so, why and when. Zuckerberg pointed to the rising momentum behind Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, saying they've "really taken off" and just "tripled in sales" in the last year. "There are more investments that I think make sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly," he added. "If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there," Zuckerberg said. "I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that," he said, "but I think that's like the ballpark of the opportunity." Zuckerberg briefly talked about how AI is going to change how people consume and create content online. While social media platforms mostly started off as text-based feeds, then photo, and are now in the "video era," Zuckerberg said that the next big thing could be interactive content. "In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it'll interact back with you rather than you just watching it," Zuckerberg said on the call. He recently said on Theo Von's "This Past Weekend" podcast that tech will move away from mobile phone screens and to holograms. Threads, which Meta launched in 2023 to compete with X (formerly Twitter), has surpassed 350 million monthly active users, Zuckerberg said on the call. It "continues to be on track to become our next major social app," he added. AI's improvements to Meta's content recommendation systems also contributed to a 35% increase in time spent on Threads, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also kicked off the call talking about the company's AI work, calling this "the major theme" at Meta right now. He listed 5 ways AI usage is playing out at Meta: "Improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, meta AI, and AI devices." While he noted these are "long-term investments that are downstream from us," he added that he thinks further down the road the company "will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making." Both of these sentiments should sound familiar, as he's given similar remarks when pressed on the company's AI initiatives and spending in previous earnings calls. In his opening remarks, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty" — but didn't explicitly name President Trump or cite his tariffs. CFO Susan Li prefaced the company's guidance estimates by acknowledging the "dynamic macro environment" and noting the range "reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes." "We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth, and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes," she said. However, some listeners (including at BI!) noted glitches as Zuckerberg started to speak. Who the hell is running $META conference call! Keeps glitching Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro says the company's AI integration plan "not only keeps growing at an impressive rate but also does so without burning through piles of cash, unlike most of the competition." "Meta is quietly gaining ground as one of the greatest winners of the AI revolution — with still lots of tailwinds and room for expansion," he said. While tariff uncertainty means eyes are on Meta's APAC ad revenue from retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US consumers, the company is well-positioned to "free up margins from other parts of the operation without damaging its longer-term growth plans" if those figures skew lower, Monteiro adds. As EMARKETER senior analyst Minda Smiley points out, Meta's strong earnings and healthy ad business show its massive content moderation overhaul in January, which included ending its fact-checking program and switching to a community notes-based model, didn't scare off advertisers. The next test will be staying strong in the uncertain macroeconomic environment stemming from tariffs, though Meta's sheer size and reach should help safeguard them. "Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty," Smiley notes. When big tech companies like Meta do mass layoffs — as the company has done over the last couple of years — it gets plenty of attention. So you might be surprised to learn that in addition to firing thousands of people, Meta has also been hiring. You can see that story buried in the company's earnings reports. After the first quarter of 2023, Meta had 77,114 fulltime employees. Then the company pushed out huge swaths of its employees, and by the end of that year it was down to 67,317. Meta continues to cut and trim throughout the company — it just rolled out cuts to its Reality Labs division, as we note below. But at the same time, it has also been hiring! Meta now says it has 76,834 employees. That's an 11% increase over the previous year, and it means Mark Zuckerberg's workforce has almost exactly as many people as it did two years ago. Meta's Reality Labs division, which builds the Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the Horizon Worlds platform, posted a $4.2 billion loss. That's wider than the $3.85 billion loss a year ago, but narrowed from $4.65 billion last quarter. The unit remains a massive money sink, with over $50 billion in cumulative losses since 2020. Just last week, Meta laid off staff from its VR gaming teams and the Supernatural VR fitness app as part of a broader shakeup. Still, the company is keeping its foot on the gas — nearly 500 Reality Labs jobs remain open. One bright spot? Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg sported at LlamaCon, the company's first event for AI developers yesterday, have become a surprise hit. Meta is reportedly expected to launch a new version with a built-in display later this year. The European Commission, the main executive body of the European Union, recently published a decision finding that Meta breached the Digital Markets Act, a set of regulations in the bloc meant to regulate the power of six digital "gatekeepers," aka Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft. The Commission consequently fined Meta €200 million. Meta weighed in on the decision in its earnings report. "We expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025," the company said. Meta will appeal the decision but said that changes to its model may be made before or during the appeal process. The company is being closely watched this earnings season, along with its Big Tech peers, for comments about its AI spending. It raised its estimate for full-year capital expenditures from a prior range of $60-$65 billion to $64-$72 billion now. That's up significantly from its full-year 2024 capex of $39.23 billion. The increase "reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware." Meta said in its earnings report, however, that the majority of its capex this year will go toward its "core business." First quarter Revenue: $42.31 billion, +16% y/y, estimate $41.38 billion Operating income: $17.56 billion, +27% y/y, estimate $15.52 billion Ad impressions: +5% vs. +20% y/y, estimate +6.87% Second quarter forecast Full-year 2025 Capital expenditure: $64 billion to $72 billion, saw $60 billion to $65 billion, estimate $59.27 billion Source: Bloomberg data Meta stock dipped 1% ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday after the closing bell. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, while the Dow rose 0.4%. Stocks were broadly lower on Wednesday after the release of first-quarter GDP, which dropped at an annualized rate of 0.3%, but reversed the losses into the close. It seems like the Meta CEO has been everywhere ahead of his company's earnings report. From his marriage to AI trends, Zuck is getting deep this week during livestreams and podcast appearances. He opened up about the 7-foot statue he dedicated to his wife and got real about higher education. The question on everyone's lips this earnings season is how companies plan to tackle tariffs. Zuckerberg seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach when asked about it, but investors will want some answers. A day before its earnings, Meta held its first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, unveiling a new Llama API. The company also announced a standalone Meta AI app, its most direct challenge yet to OpenAI's ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was joined onstage by Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Databricks' Ali Ghodsi, underscoring Meta's push to become central to the AI developer ecosystem. The event wasn't just about product announcements — it was a calculated play to reassure investors. "I expect Meta's earnings release and subsequent call to be packed with AI news," Forrester VP Mike Proulx told Business Insider, "not only because the company is making real and tangible progress, but also to counterbalance the intense pressure Meta is facing on multiple fronts," he said, pointing to the ongoing FTC antitrust trial against the company. Expect Wall Street to listen closely during today's earnings call for signs that Meta's massive AI investments — including up to $65 billion in 2025 capex — are starting to deliver returns. Meta's X competitor, Threads, had 320 million monthly active users at the time of the company's last earnings call, adding a million new people daily. It's one of the few recent social apps to scale this quickly, and Meta is finally starting to test monetization. Last week, the company began rolling out ads on Threads globally. Still, Meta executives have said they don't expect the app to contribute meaningful revenue in 2025. For now, it's about playing the long game. Zuckerberg has said Threads could one day reach a billion users and become "the leading discussion platform." The question for Wall Street is whether Meta can sustain the momentum. Meta hasn't commented on whether the US-China trade war will hurt its bottom line, but it's another thing investors will be watching closely over the next few earnings cycles. Meta has said that 11% of its total ad sales last year came from Chinese advertisers, which could dial back their spending as the trade war looms. With tariffs on Chinese imports now as high as 145%, many companies can't afford to sell into the US market, which means there's less incentive to advertise to American shoppers. If that trend accelerates, it could negatively impact Meta's ad business. Analysts will be closely watching Meta's investments in generative AI and its Reality Labs division, which has hemorrhaged money in recent quarters. Zuckerberg has said he's happy to keep funneling tens of billions in additional capex on generative AI even as analysts and investors press Big Tech for answers on when they'll see the massive spending pay off. Meta recently held its inaugural LlamaCon, an AI developer conference. The conference featured remarks from Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. On Tuesday, the company also announced a standalone Meta AI app to compete with ChatGPT. Wells Fargo said it expects Meta to be the "steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm," arguing that its dominance relative to other advertising platforms should shield it from some of the macroeconomic pain. "Checks indicate ad spend growth on Meta moderated throughout the qtr, but likely more resilient vs. other ad platforms against softer macro backdrop given minimal brand exposure," Wells Fargo said. The bank said Meta's Reels platform, which directly competes against TikTok, should have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban earlier this year. "Checks suggest ad spend on TikTok shifted to Meta during the heightened uncertainty in Jan, with some budgets permanently moving to Reels," the bank said. Wells Fargo rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $752 price target. A major topic during Tesla's earnings call last week was blowback over Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration. While Zuckerberg's ties to the White House aren't as deep as Musk's, he has been increasingly involved with Trump 2.0 — and investors could make it known whether they approve. Zuckerberg has had a contentious relationship with the president over the years; Trump once threatened the Meta CEO with life in prison. However, since the election, Zuck has seemed to try to smooth things over. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and Zuckerberg was among the tech billionaires who got a front row seat to the swearing in This year, Meta partnered with the White House to bring the Easter Egg Roll. Despite macroeconomic concerns, JPMorgan said that Meta's strong execution and AI opportunities should help the company's results. "We believe META remains well-owned driven by strong execution & growing AI monetization," JPMorgan analysts wrote. "We're bullish on AI-driven Ad improvements, video unification, WhatsApp Ads, Llama, & Meta AI." The bank said it believes investors expect Meta Platforms' revenue to grow by about 13% year over year. Meeting or beating those expectations would likely boost the stock. It said that while macro factors are a concern, "tens of millions of advertisers should prove relative insulation." With regards to capex, JPMorgan expects the company to maintain its aggressive investment philosophy to capture the AI opportunity. "Our $108B 2025 GAAP expenses is below Meta's $114B-$119B guide as we expect META to rationalize expenses against lower growth," JPMorgan said. JPMorgan rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $610 price target. Investors will be watching closely to see if Meta's Reality Labs — its hardware and virtual reality division — is cutting back on its burn rate after racking up more than $50 billion in losses since 2020. The division, responsible for products like Quest headsets and smart glasses, was reorganized in January with key leaders now reporting directly to Meta's top brass. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has called 2025 "the most critical" year for Reality Labs, writing in an internal memo obtained by BI earlier this year that it could determine whether the effort is remembered as a visionary feat or a "legendary misadventure." He also stressed that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for Meta's metaverse ambitions to stay afloat. Bosworth said Reality Labs grew sales 40% in 2024 and cited "massive" growth in wearables. But investors will want to see if those revenue gains are enough to begin narrowing the division's steep losses, which totaled $4.4 billion in Q3 of 2024 alone. Bank of America is leaning bullish on Meta heading into its coming earnings release. The bank said takeaways from Alphabet's comments on YouTube and its advertising checks should fuel a "modest beat" for Meta. Meta's workforce reductions in February and recent layoff announcements related to its Reality Labs division suggest that management is laser-focused on controlling operating expenses. "For expense guide, we would expect a trajectory toward the low end of the current $114-$119bn 2025 range," Bank of America said. The bank is also bullish on Meta's growing AI capabilities and its potential to unlock more advertising spending. "We think Meta's Al driven ad improvements still have several quarters to play out and for 2025 we see strong drivers of growth, including: 1) Expanding AI/ML ad capabilities, 2) Growing SFV usage aided by AI suggestions, 3) Growing messaging revenues, & 4) Monetization of untapped surfaces (Threads, Meta Al, Marketplace)," the bank said. SFV refers to "short form video." Bank of America rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $640 price target. An elephant in the room is the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial against Meta. The company isn't expected to discuss the ongoing case during its earnings call, and the litigation isn't expected to have a significant impact on the results. The trial kicked off earlier this month, and Zuckerberg testified over three days. The FTC alleges that Meta, then Facebook, violated US antitrust laws when it bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. Asked about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, Zuckerberg testified that he considered having Facebook build its own photo-sharing service, but ultimately, "I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them." Meta's attorneys have argued that the company still faces competition from social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube, and X. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Meta's Reels platform has the potential to drive significant growth for the company. "We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions," Goldman Sachs said. On the spending front, the bank expects Meta to "somewhat pull back" on its planned investments due to macroeconomic headwinds. Goldman expects 2025 total GAAP expenses of about $110.5 billion, slightly below the company's guidance range of $114 billion to $119 billion. "For META, we see the key debates being how the company indicates a framework of balance between long-term investments and annualized operating costs if the macroeconomic environment impacts the business in the coming quarters," Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $685 price target.

April 28, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: August 8, 2023 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.
